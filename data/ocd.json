        "Text": "There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.\n\nThat being said, I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.\n\nI have never regretted being stopped.\n\nSince you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.\n\nSo, right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.\n\nSo what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.\n\nFirst off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.\n\nIf you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.\n\nNext, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.\n\nIf you can’t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.\n\nIf you’re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.\n\nGo outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.\n\nWhen is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.\n\nWhen’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.\n\nWhen is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.\n\nYou have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.\n\nYou will be ok and you can make it through this.\n\nWe are all rooting for you.\n\nhttps://www.supportiv.com/tools/international-resources-crisis-and-warmlines",

        "Upvotes": 64,
        "Text": "There has been some confusion regarding reassurance seeking and providing in this subreddit.\n\n**Reassurance seeking** (a person asking for reassurance) is **allowed only if it is limited** — **no repeated seeking of reassurance**.\n\n**Reassurance providing** (a person giving reassurance) is **not allowed**.\n\n## What constitutes reassurance providing?\n\nBefore commenting on a reassurance-seeking question, answer to yourself this question: Are you **directly** answering what the person is asking, and is the answer meant to cause the person to feel better?\n\n**If the answer leads towards a \"yes\", refrain from commenting.**\n\n## How should I comment on reassurance-seeking questions then?\n\nThe issue concerned in reassurance-seeking questions is the emotional obsessive distress that is occurring in the moment, **not the question itself**.\n\nWhen you answer those reassurance-seeking questions to quell the person's emotional obsessive distress, **it's an act of providing emotional comfort to the person** — even if you don't have such explicit intention in mind — rather than an act of providing knowledge.\n\nThe person just wants to know they are \"fine\" in relation to the obsessive question/thought. **The answer itself is irrelevant** — that's why we don't answer questions of a reassurance-seeking nature directly.\n\n**You can comment in any way you want — even providing encouragement and hope — but refrain from addressing the reassurance-seeking question itself.**\n\n## What if the reassurance-seeking question turns out to be true?\n\nConsider this question: What if the reassurance-seeking question didn't even occur in the first place? What then?\n\nWe can go round and round with more \"what-ifs\", but it circles back to the fact that reality is uncertain, and will always be uncertain. **That is why the acceptance of uncertainty is crucial to recovery.**\n\n## Does that mean the reassurance-seeking question is totally invalid? Because I had a question that was based on reality.\n\nTake note that in the context of OCD, the issue rests with how a person is dealing with the issues, **and not so much the issues themselves**.\n\n**The issues can be entirely valid**, but what we are dealing with here — especially with reassurance — is **how we respond** to such issues.\n\n**Separate the reassurance part — the emotional comfort part — from the issues themselves.**\n\n## All of this is not true. My therapist taught me in the beginning of therapy that these thoughts are not true, and then I got better.\n\nIt's important to understand the intent and purpose of each and every information provided.\n\nWhen a person with OCD is beginning to learn about OCD, they can be taught, for example, that the obsessive thoughts do not reflect on their true character.\n\nThe intent and purpose of that example information is **cognitive-based** — to educate the person — and that helps to, subsequently, **be followed up by ERP, which is behavioural-based** — hence **cognitive-behavioural therapy** (of which ERP is a part of).\n\nWhen a person seeks reassurance, it is mostly solely behavioural: **the concern here is to quell the emotional obsessive distress** — take that emotional obsessive distress away, and the reassurance-seeking question suddenly becomes largely irrelevant and of less urgency.\n\n## This is so un-compassionate. Are we seriously going to let these people suffer?\n\nProviding reassurance doesn't really help the person not suffer either — the way out of that suffering is through the proper therapy and treatment, **and providing reassurance to the person only interferes with this process**.\n\nConsider as well that if reassurance is provided to the person, where an outcome is guaranteed to the person (\"You won't be this! I guarantee you!\").\n\n**What if the reassurance turns out to be false? What happens then? How much more distressful would the person be (given that they would've trusted the reassurance to keep them safe, only now for their entire world to fall apart)?**\n\nBefore considering that not providing reassurance is un-compassionate, perhaps it's also wise to consider what providing reassurance can lead to as well.\n\nThe reality will always be uncertain, as it is. There is no such solution that guarantees the person won't suffer, but we can at least minimise the suffering **by doing what is helpful towards the person** (especially in terms of the therapy and treatment) — and that doesn't always necessarily entail making the person feel better in the moment.",

I’ve been in therapy for around 9 months  and my therapist and I are slowly realizing that I might have ocd instead of previously assumed general anxiety. Therefore I would like to know if any of you experience this:\nI spend most of my day obsessing over things in thoughts. So I constantly think about everything I still need to do, past situations, etc. and my brain usually picks one thing to make me feel bad that I then think about for a long time. If I get suddenly interrupted and distracted tho, sometimes I forget what I was thinking about and feel like a weight has been lifted off me. That feeling only lasts a second tho, because I can hear myself think „nah hold on, what were we stressed about, I know we were worrying about something“ and before I even realize it, I’m back at obsessing over the thing I was thinking about. \nDoes this sound like a familiar situation to any of you?",

I suffer from lots of different types of OCD, mostly contamination. And I do hate OCD with a passion, but at times I’ve caught myself saying \"thank you OCD\" for \"saving me\" from a situation I was afraid would happen if I didn’t do this compulsion, and sometimes it has. For example, I’ve checked for stains on my clothes before and one time I did, I wore another shirt bevause of it, and in that way I was thankful, because if I hadn’t, I felt like the stain would still be there. I realize this is a compulsion, but that fear creeps in and takes over. So has anyone had a moment where \"OCD saved them\" from a fear coming true? ",

        "Text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm 23 and have been super scared of being cancelled ever since I was fired from a temp job when I was 19 (it was a misunderstanding, I said/did some things that people took as offensive but I truly don't know how it could be - I've obsessed for hours and hours over whether I was in the wrong or not, I would never want to hurt or offend people, but I'm trying to stop overanalyzing the incident because it's just another obsession/OCD thing. Again, please don't think I'm a terrible person, lol).\n\nI'm starting my career, as I graduated from college, and I really want to be a political journalist/theorist. Now, this is the worst job ever for someone with an intense fear of being cancelled, because politics is so inherently controversial it just feels like someone is inevitably going to try to ruin my life even if I only have good intentions. The problem is that a lot of people know about this incident where I was fired, and a lot of them have really different politics than me - I'm so scared they're going to bring it up somehow, or report it to another employer, or something. And people reassuring me, saying \"cancellation doesn't happen or is unlikely,\" just...doesn't help, because I feel like I was already cancelled when I was fired - or, even worse, I was actually in the wrong and did/said bad stuff, in which case I'd feel super guilty because I hurt people and the people looking to cancel me would actually have legitimate reason to cancel me. And now I'm going through all the things I've ever said or done that could be portrayed in a really bad way, or were actually bad, and mistakes I've made, and I'm just convinced I'm on borrowed time before I get booted out of public life - which I would want to be in for my job - entirely, or ostracized from everyone I know and will ever meet.\n\nIdk. I'm just super freaked out, and it's stopping me from pursuing my career and dreams.",

I’ve been suffering for 4 years and it has been a living hell. I’ve been on multiple Ssri medications and been in CBT therapy (hard to find access to a ERP therapist) I also never quit porn until a few months ago, it’s something I’ve always struggled with on top of this bullshit. I have sexual intrusive thoughts of all kinds of shit, mostly HOCD though. I know who I am and who I’m emotionally attracted to but it causes me to irrationally question 24/7. \nI’ve been in a couple relationships since this started and I have had times where I was doing great but other times where its just so fucking debilitating. I have suicidal thoughts and feel so worthless because of it, I feel like a joke. Dealing with grief/personal hardship in my life has made it much worse. I isolate most the time which I know isn’t good for me but I can’t bear to deal with these thoughts around people I love and care about. \nTo anyone out there who has dealt with this pos disorder, did you ever conquer it?

My freshman year, and in high school before, I had always worn either skirts and tights or some sort of cute outfit. \n\nBut increasingly I have only been able to wear black clothes and no skirts or jeans because I am afraid I am either going to pee myself or get my period. I do not have a history of peeing myself and there’s no reason this should be an issue, but I commute to school and I’m so scared that somehow my tights or pants will be ruined and I won’t be able to do anything about it.\n\nIn the last days I did wear light clothes like jeans I would spend the whole class anxious that I peed myself and was convinced when I stood up everyone would see I peed, and would even convince myself as I was leaving the classroom that people were giving shocked looks. I’d proceed to go to the bathroom and not even have to pee.\n\nI have so many cute expensive jeans I can’t wear, so many skirts and tights. Every time I even look at them or take them out to wear before school my brain is like ARE YOU CRAZY? and it’s either the same black leggings or scream pajama pants.

        "Text": "I just started seeing a therapist trained in ERP. I live in south Alabama with extremely limited options. But I found one. I scored a 31 on the YBOC. When we were going over it I told her I had sexual orientation OCD as a kid but as an adult discovered that I am bisexual. She responded by asking if I am sure I’m bisexual or if it’s just my OCD. She said “I mean have you ever acted on it?” And my gut reaction was to feel so invalidated and sad. I had also previously told her that after growing up very Christian, I walked away from it a few years ago. She said she wondered if that was OCD too. I just found myself not trusting her and doubting her because I am in a very conservative Christian part of the country. But I’m trying to discern if I need to just try to trust her. I know those things can be related to OCD. Maybe it was just the way she asked. Like she felt pretty certain. \n\nOf course now it has me doubting my sexuality. My sexual orientation OCD as a kid was me being TERRIFIED that I was gay. That certain thoughts meant I was gay. I would spend a lot of time in my head rationalizing. That stopped being an issue after like high school. Then a few years out of college after leaving christian ministry, I started to discover my sexuality. I was attracted to women, their bodies. It felt exciting to me, empowering. Of course I still have fears and doubts in the back of my mind.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about my therapist? Of course my brain is black and white and wants to just cut her off. But my options are limited- I would prob have to find someone virtually. I am also considering doing an intensive program because of the severity I’m experiencing right now. ",

My intrusive thoughts are now blasphemous in nature and that causes me to get so upset. I believe in God and I believed in the past as well, even if I did not grow up in a very religious household or community. I mostly had faith in a higher power like those around me did. But now I worry about stuff like sin and condemnation almost all the time. One of my biggest struggles is I feel like bad things will happen to me if I support the Lgbt community or watch anything with gay people or any sex in it, even though before I had no problem being an ally or sex positive. I have friends and family that are part of the community and now I worry they might go to hell. I do not want to go to hell myself or make God hate me but these thoughts keep getting worse and my compulsions do not feel like enough so they have escalated too. How can I fight OCD at this state, where I feel like I disrespect God everytime I try to go against it? Even writing this I feel like I am sinning and I am a bad person. This is the first time I feel like OCD might have actually beaten me. ",

        "Text": "First of all I’ve struggled with OCD for many years and I’ve had multiple themes. Since following Dr Greenbergs method of stopping rumination I am feeling so much better. However there is still something holding me back from full recovery and I’m not sure how to move past it. My issue is now that I know how to recover and can see the results from not ruminating that I’ve become obsessed with the recovery itself. I know this is classed as Meta OCD and believe me I have done plenty of research to understand how this works. But I still can’t seem to move past this theme no matter how hard I try.\n\nDon’t get me wrong I am in such a better place and I am so thankful for his advice but I feel like I’m still falling back in the cycle from time to time. My issue is self talk. I constantly talk to myself all the time especially when my anxiety is bad or I feel low. I will say something along the lines of “okay you feel bad at the moment, remember this is your OCD, we need to let the feeling be and direct our attention else where, what we’re doing right now is a choice…” and this can vary depending on how much anxiety I’m experiencing and I will end up repeating this multiple times until I get that “just right” feeling. I think I have a problem with doing it “one last time” I will feel better but then there will be that tiny bit of anxiety which makes me go back and almost remind myself and recite my OCD recovery plan. If I don’t I almost feel like I won’t realise when I’m doing it again and might fall back in the cycle without realising.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience when following the recovery process. I feel like I should try to just not self talk but when I do that again I will feel the need to tell myself not to (which is self talk). I do feel better but I just feel like this nagging annoying feeling will never go away and don’t know how to stop myself from going back to it and repeating the same plan in my head.\n\nI watched a video where they said act as if you’ve already recovered from OCD or if you don’t even have it. Maybe that’s what I will try next but I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how I could potentially stop this?",

But it seems when I get stuck in the OCD loop sometimes it can last for months.\n\n  \nMy theme started in 2014 when I jokingly sniffed an aerosol can, it sent me into panic and for 3 days I thought I was going to die. It then shifted to self-harm / suicide OCD where it caused me great distress for 2 years because I thought something was wrong with me. So I didn't speak up about it until I couldn't take anymore.\n\nWhen I was 17, I finally broke the cycle and escaped the thoughts. However, in 2021 it came back more intense than before. I took a medication (with no side-effects) until I saw online there was a small cohort of people claiming it gave them life changing side-effects. I noticed that one of those side-effects was anxiety / panic attacks and thus, I had a panic attack that I would be permanently anxious. It took me 5 months of therapy (no meds) to overcome this theme, to this day I think I lucked out, I don't know how I did it. Maybe someone was looking out for me.\n\nLife has been fantastic since 2021. But I made a massive mistake, unknowingly at the time. I tried cannabis for the first time 2 weeks ago on a trip to Amsterdam and it caused a massive panic attack like I have never felt before. I didn't know it could do this. I was just trying to have a typical tourist experience. Since then, my brain has convinced me that this level of anxiety is permanent - that i'm never going to get better and that every day will feel like this forever. It's more intense, there's more layers to it. I just don't know what to do. I am in constant fear that I will never go back to how I was.\n\nAny advice on this theme is greatly appreciated.",

I just got off birth control for good around probably 6 months ago which in the past being on birth control helped with OCD but not completely. I don’t plan on going back on birth control because it’s screwed me up. I haven’t been diagnosed but I’m pretty sure I have PMDD, but I have been diagnosed with OCD. Because my hormones are going back to normal/ are changing I’m getting OCD flare ups around my period again and it’s so difficult to adjust to. I get an increase in intrusive thoughts during ovulation and before and during my period. But it can last longer if I allow it to consume me enough to become depressed. This time around I’ve been a lot more anxious about everything and I’ve had a lot more heart palpitations throughout the day. My screen time also increases because it’s my way of distracting my mind, even though I don’t think it helps in the long run. It’s kind of interesting to know that my OCD is definitely a hormonal thing but it’s not easy to convince myself that it’s just hormones and my brain chemistry. I started taking a multivitamin, magnesium glycinate, ashwagandha, and I’m planning on eating better. The cold season and time change could be adding to the intensity of my symptoms. I also want to start running again but it’s been so cold outside that it’s hard to motivate myself to do so, but I know it’d help. Has any supplements or habits helped anyone during these times? I’ve been wanting to start drinking tea again if anyone has recommendations? ",

I know there are plenty of other ways bacteria or viruses can get into the body and cause illness outside from breathing them in, but still, does this help at all?\n\nDoes anyone else do this too?

I need advice on the following situation:\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I am a Christian. This is important to the story. So, I live with my grandparents and help to care for them. Therefore , I sleep in the same room as them at night - in case there’s an emergency. I’ve also been extremely worried about my job lately . I’ve been reassured countless times that it is not a seasonal position. However , this morning when I woke up - idk if i even controlled this thought or not- I basically seem to have asked God “If nothing bad is going to happen to my job, please let my grandma still be laying in the chair next to me.” And then when I got up, she wasn’t laying there because she had gone to the bathroom. \n\nRationally speaking, I know these events aren’t related . My mind doesn’t care - it’s convinced that when I go into work today that they’re going to tell me my job is now a seasonal one. 😔 Any advice please? \n\n\n( Also yes i’m on meds . Prozac and Vistaril ) ",

It’s been making ERP a lot more easier! \n\nSo latley I’ve had a fear that I’m attracted to my friend whom I have a kind of age gap with? I haven’t talked to this person in so long but I can admit that they’re conveniently attractive.\n\nFor more context, I have a slight hand fetish for slender hands with rings which my friend has. And he’s also the youngest out of my friend group I used to hang out with him in.\n\nFriend told me I can find certain parts attractive but not be attracted to them. And this is something I truly do not want. \n\nI’ve been obsessing so hard about this possibility I am attracted to his hands in that way (I know there’s probably nothing wrong with being only attracted to his hands, but in my eyes, I don’t want that for myself) \n\nSo again, I learnt that gorinal responses and “false attraction” is just like your brain thinking that you thought of something that’s attractive and sends a signal down there, thinking this was a “fantasy” or something. \n\nI haven’t had this problem until recently, I used to hang out with my friend normally and not get anxiety. I used to enjoy his presence but now I’m filled with fear everytime I see him or if he’s mentioned.\n\nERP has been working well recently in normal scenarios like going for a walk or just being with my boyfriend. And I’ve been doing well to not react to these thoughts, ESPECIALLY down there. sometimes it comes with a response but knowing it’s something I don’t want, and that I feel anxiety afterwords, it’s just classic OCD. \n\n\nAnyways. I’ve been really wanting to get freaky with my BF or in general because I’ve been avoiding freaky moments in fear that my friends hands will randomly pop up and make it seem like I enjoyed it. But what should I do during these intimate moments? \n\nThere was some times where I tried using ERP during a self freaky moment and it kind of worked? I didn’t react to it and carried on. But it was until afterwords when I was done I started overthinking about it and hyperanalyzing the memories.",

My medication has helped the thoughts slow down, and while I still have days where I don't feel too good, they're a lot better and easier to manage. I find with the diagnosis, it makes it easier to tell what thoughts are my own and what is my OCD. Sometimes I'll even give my OCD a dumb name, and I'll just look at those awful thoughts collectively and go \"No one cares what you think, Jerry.\"\nI also find my outlook on stressful situations is different too.

Usually if it's bad at night especially I try avoidance and try to hold my pee so I don't have to walk to the toilet lol.

        "Text": "Since moving to university, my OCD has gotten much worse. I worked hard to get into a top 10 UK university, being away from my family has made everything worse. I wake up nervous, overwhelmed with repetitive, negative thoughts, and constantly feel the urge to triple-check things, fearing something bad will happen if I don’t. I keep calling my family for reassurance, asking questions I know I shouldn’t but can’t stop myself from asking. It’s especially hard with thoughts about God—I’ll see something online, then spend 30 minutes checking if I accidentally liked or commented on it, even though I know I didn’t, and then pray repeatedly for forgiveness. Then I’ll start worrying that my social media is being tracked, and I feel lost and unsure of what to do.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore— Deadlines are appraoching and I’m falling behind in lectures, and the added stress is making my OCD worse. I’m torn between transferring to a lower-ranked university closer to home (which i will regret as i worked so hard to be here), where I feel safer with my family, or staying here and risking feeling even more depressed and helpless because of my OCD.\n\nI feel helpless—my GP referred me to the NHS mental health department, but they just sent me back to my GP. I’m stuck being bounced between them, and it’s incredibly frustrating. The longer i wait, i feel like i am just making my OCD worse by doing the urges and negatively thinking which i can't control.\n\nI asked my university if I could study remotely since the lectures are online, but they refused and directed me to mental health services, where I’m still waiting for an appointment. Without a diagnosis, I’m not receiving any support except from my family, who are doing all they can to help me. It’s mentally exhausting for both them and me, as I keep calling about every little negative thought. I hate relying on them so much, but my family is my only support right now since I’m not getting help from my GP.\n\nWhat should I do, please help?\n\n4o",

I have his therapist starting therapy on it with him, but how do I deal with the day-to-day because he cries and is barely making it places on time.

Sometimes a thing is just a thing. Sometimes a thing just sucks. Sometimes it is complicated. You're not necessarily overthinking something or spiraling. Sometimes you're just thinking hard about something.\n\nThis is something that I've had on my mind a lot. OCD can disguise regular 'ol thinking or analyzing as ruminating and compulsions. This isn't always the case. \n\nMaybe I'm just saying all of this because I've truly been worried that every thought pattern I have is OCD-tinted. I've been obsessing over every thought and reaction. For example, I may think \"Oh no, I'm sad to hear that an old coworker passed away.\" This initial thought then makes me think \"Am I actually sad that they passed, or am is their passing away getting to me because it makes me think of my own death or the deaths of people I care about. Am I actually sad not even because of the death, and I'm just a faker without a heart? What's wrong with me? I'm a psychopath!\"\n\nNah dude (@me), you're just sad because someone died.

        "Text": "Hi, I am in a mental crisis right now. I have really bad intrusive thoughts and obviously stumbled upon the channel \"OCD & Anxiety\" by Nathan Peterson on Youtube. I watched some of his videos and from what I vaguely remember, one of his tips was to kind of \"casually agree\" with the thought, if that makes sense? Like \"yeah you're right, whatever man.\" to an intrusive thought to try and pay it no mind.\n\nSo I've been practicing that tip but it's starting to worry me because as soon as an intrusive thought comes, I agree with it \"casually\" in a manner like it's no big deal. And it does help, it does reduce my obsessions over it, and I am able to let the thought fly by.\n\nBUT here's the issue: Everytime I \"agree\" with the thought for the sake of letting it pass, I actually start to BELIEVE it. For example: A racist or sexist thought pops up and I \"agree\", but then after a number of times I do it. Or whenever those thoughts come, it's like my brain automatically actually starts to believe them as truth. It starts to ingrain those racist thoughts/beliefs or any other disturbing stuff. It's making me question my morals and now it's becoming a new obsession of itself. Fyi I definitely wasn't racist or sexist before and I don't ever wanna be, but I'm afraid agreeing with these thoughts may be developing those tendencies in small bits. \n\nI feel like my mind has gotten too lazy and just slumped back on some mental couch and agree with those thoughts like \"yeah ur true lol\". I feel like I am accidentally affirming that \"yes, I agree with these thoughts, therefore these thoughts and the beliefs associated with them must be true.\"\n\nI need advice on this, what is happening??",

I find myself stuck on this idea of losing or having lost potential. I graduated high school as valedictorian, won awards throughout my undergrad, and got into every master's program into which I applied. I keep thinking about the program I chose. Like, what if it was the wrong one? What if this other school was better, more prestigious, had a better faculty? I'm constantly looking up information about the schools to confirm that the one I chose is actually okay. I'm subtly checking with faculty members and colleagues about the same kinds of questions. I spend so much time looking into other programs, making plans for what's next, planning out every part of my life to ensure that I remain impressive, particularly while I'm young. \n\nA few comments from someone I was casually dating really triggered a spiral for me. It felt as though he was questioning the validity of my research and the legitimacy of my discipline. It hurt me at the time and now it's in my head every time I read an article, discuss my research in class, write, review. I'm searching and talking to people to figure out if what I'm doing means anything, going down rabbit holes. \n\nI hate it because I know that this is the field for me. I know that I'm doing well, that I'm respected, and that I'm going down the right path. I care about what I'm doing and I think it will make a difference but I'm so obsessed with being successful. I don't want to make money or to be known. I'm terrified of anyone knowing who I am. I just want what I do to matter. I want it to be right. When I get stuck in these cycles, it feels like what I've understood as my reality is being shaken and if that's the case, who even am I? What else could fall apart?\n\nDoes anyone have advice or suggestions for this? I've started therapy but am in the early stages. ",

The gap between me and the shower feels like miles. Every day that goes by, the guilt just piles on and the longer I go, the longer I go. Everyone must think I'm lazy. 'm now on day 3 which is my average. (2-4 is the norm) (f/29) \n\nI just want to share to see if anyone can relate to this specific type of issue I'm having (as long as i can remember but mild when I was young, getting pretty extreme now) TL;DR : I hate showering but I love being clean \n\nsidebar, I don't like touching water, it makes my hands dry. I have to apply lotion every time i touch water. some days worse than others but the shower issue remains unchanged regardless. \n\nBefore the shower : \nStanding barefooted on the tile, getting contaminated with possibly urine, feces, dust, dirt, on my feet, and (not even sure how) on my face, in my mouth, hands. (laying down a towel helps, but once i step off the towel everything else feels even worse like i might puke) \n\nDuring the shower : \nThe water is ok. washing hair is ok, takes forever though\n and so i feel like all the soap / clean is rinsing off of me until I'm dirty again. so I'll wash again. washing gets weird because i feel like I'm re-contaminating myself. and the longer I take the more dry my skin will feel after I'm dried off. \n(also have a thing about lotion, i have to have it and i hate re-applying it because it's a chore, it has to be everywhere after a shower)\n\nAfter the shower :\nTbh idk what's worse. Getting in, or getting out. and I'm sure for anyone, going from warm cozy shower to cold air while wet, doesn't feel great. But to me i feel like I'm covered in this gross slime (the water) and touching the towel is awful. I can't look where I'm drying cause then I'll think I'm still dirty. When I'm dry, now I'm cold. Which is to be expected right. but now I have to do lotion everywhere, and wait for it to kind of soak into my skin. \n\nClothes :\nLord, have mercy. Clothes on top of lotion everything is the absolute worst. But even worse without lotion. Idk which one is worse, again. \nOnce I'm done done, I don't want to re-contaminate myself by leaving the bathroom so that takes a while. So I'll brush my teeth.\n\nI'd say this process (for an everything shower) takes minimum 1-2 hours, that is including the prep, and brushing my hair afterwards which is long) \n\nI don't want advice I just wanted to share my experience so maybe even one person doesn't feel alone. for reference to state of mind, I'm diagnosed with cPTSD, OCD, anxiety, depression.

It'd be interesting to know if my experience isn't a one-off thing",

        "Text": "I’ve never had any OCD symptoms in my life, like none at all. However, last week I was suddenly struck by these incessant compulsive thoughts. It wasn’t how OCD is presented in movies, like the physical ‘I have to close the car door three times exactly’ or something like that but it was this mental thing. Whenever I read a word of phrase my brain would fixate on it until it was satisfied, or if I saw something like a plane I would compulsively think about it, like how was it made, how was the plane invented, how does it work, then I’d start fixating on gravity. Just small meaningless crap. It made no sense and it was honestly crippling, I couldn’t look at my phone or anything without this compulsive thinking just having me in a chokehold, it was terrible. \n\nI found a psychiatrist asap and he asked if I’ve ever had any OCD symptoms and I told him no, he ended up prescribing me divalproex (I think it’s called depakote in the US) and olanzipine. It worked absolutely magnificently I cannot even believe it, medicine is so great. One side effect however is a huge appetite but the psychiatrist said the olanzipine would cause that and it’s not really a big deal. The other one is my main problem. When I try to be intimate with my girlfriend, the guy downstairs gets erect easily enough but the feeling is significantly diminished, I can’t feel as much as before and therefore it takes me way longer to finish, and that’s if I finish at all. Talked to my psychiatrist about it and he said only thing he can think of is maybe lowering the dose. Even worse I don’t know if it’s the divalproex or the olanzipine that’s causing it. Has anyone experienced this that can shed some light on it and any possible remedies? Thanks for reading!",

        "Text": "Hi everyone! I (23f) am currently medicated (for 1.5 years now! I’m on the starter dose of Zoloft) and feel I have been managing my symptoms pretty well. I did CBT in the past, but honestly didn’t find it helpful. I felt it made \nmy rumination worse and I just didn’t find it effective. For some background, I recently moved to a new city by myself to start grad school. For the most part, I’ve handled the adjustment quite well. (Also preface- I’m not super well versed in the medical terminology of all of this so please forgive me if I misspeak on it as well) Some of my ocd triggers are about social situations and I often think I insulted someone, was mean, broke something in their house, accidentally said something insane and just spoke gibberish, etc. \n\nBefore moving, I never dealt with thoughts like this. I think it’s because I’m completely by myself out here pretty much. There’s no one that I’m close enough with that I feel comfortable bringing this up to to get some reassurance I didn’t just keyboard smash out \nloud. This is honestly the only symptom and problem I’ve been having lately. I get some side effects from my current dose of sertraline, so I honestly really don’t want to up the dosage. I could also try therapy again, but with my schedule as a grad student, I just don’t know if I think it would be worth it. I also feel like this will be an issue that goes away once I establish more friendships and feel more secure. I just was wondering if anyone had gone through/is going through anything similar and if they have any tips on how to cope with these thoughts? It just keeps me up thinking I maybe explained something completely wrong during a meeting with my advisor, or called one of my class mates a bitch out of nowhere. Short of recording myself whenever I leave the house, I’m just stuck thinking about it.\n\nI want to add that this isn’t a dire issue. I am keeping myself busy with school, making friends, talking with old friends/family, having hobbies, watching tv, staying distracted, etc… but I do find it causing issues sometimes so I just figured I’d post after being a long time lurker.",

Things aren't nearly as bad as they were before, but I catch myself falling into those same fears and letting them control me.

In the past few weeks I've had intrusive thoughts about hurting my cat which breaks my heart because I love my cat so much. I don't want to \"relapse\" because those truly were the darkest days of my life. I know I should probably talk to a therapist again, but I'm curious to know if anyone has any daily tasks or activities that have helped them manage their obsessions specifically.

        "Text": "I have always been bisexual but I have recently been struggling with obsessive thoughts and ruminating about being a lesbian despite being in a long term relationship with my current boyfriend who I have always thought of as my first true love. It started with me engaging with a lot of lesbian media and coming across posts about compulsive heterosexuality and a lot of media that vilifies men. For a couple of weeks I found myself thinking about it a lot but didn’t consider that I was obsessing over or ruminating because I didn’t feel particularly anxious about it but then everything hit me at once and I proceeded to have panic attacks that spanned across several hours every day for an entire week. During that week I was consistently obsessing over these thoughts and experiencing overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame and consistently testing my attraction towards men in my head whenever I came across any media of a man and I would feel distressed if I didn’t find them attractive because it would mean that I’m a lesbian which would mean that I would have to leave my boyfriend. This all happened from the 13th to the 20th of September and I have still been obsessing over the thought daily since. Some days I am able to recognise that it is OCD and other days I convince myself that I am in denial and that I don’t actually have OCD but I am just telling myself that so that I don’t have to confront the reality that I am not actually attracted to my boyfriend and would rather be with women. This then extended into relationship OCD where I would obsess constantly about the future and whether or not I would regret staying with him or if I will resent him or if he’s secretly a really bad person and other things like that. I feel incredibly guilty for having these feelings as he’s been nothing but amazing to me and I feel very frustrated all the time because of these feelings and I feel like that has made me more compelled to be distant from him as sometimes looking at him triggers these obsessive thoughts. It is very conflicting because I know that I am attracted to women as I’ve always been bisexual, so to be constantly triggered by feeling even the slightest bit of attraction towards a woman has been very difficult to navigate as I constantly feel as though I am in denial. I now feel like I can’t enjoy any media (whether tv shows or movies etc) that involves lesbians without it triggering these obsessive thoughts, and it has also stopped me from enjoying any of the things I usually enjoy (like art and music) because I feel this ominous feeling of dread whenever I do these things because my brain convinces me it’s just a distraction and I’ll never be able to escape the truth.

        "Text": "I’ve had OCD for as long as I can remember. Lately, it’s gotten really bad. I went to a therapist about it this year but she didn’t help me at all. She wanted to try exposure therapy but, she felt like if I lost sleep that probably wouldn’t help. So, she just asked me to change the order of things and try that instead. Or just trying not doing them 🫤 I feel like I should’ve gone to someone who specialized in OCD but I digress. Anyways, I think I developed it after my mom died when I was 14. I struggled with insomnia during that time, and it was the only thing that made me relax and fall asleep was if I did things a certain way. Let’s just say I’m in my late 20s and I’ve leaned to deal with it over the years. I’m over this. I just want to be able to lay down and not do a million trillion things before bed. Lately I’ve started washing my hands more which is new and so frustrating. I really want to overcome this someday. I know that it might not ever truly go away? But I really really want to try. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also I’ve tried to not do my rituals before but I’ll wake up constantly throughout the night if I don’t. \nRituals can take almost 2 hours sometimes. \n\nAlso, it makes me late to work almost every day.

        "Text": "Being able to clean myself means occasionally sticking a plastic drain snake into the filthy waste holes of the tub and sink and pulling out all the hair and nasty black-brown-green goop that catches on the spikes. A lot of it is mushy stuff that doesn't seem like it can hold itself together well enough to block a drain.\n\nMy attempt to save water by only ever turning the faucet on low so as to not waste a bunch between rinses probably means there's never enough pressure to wash it down. I used to use a hardcore drain cleaner called Liquid Fire that tbh didn't even work that well and turns out isn't necessary. Plastic drain snakes are way cheaper and way more effective.\n\nI did the tub drain yesterday while taking a shower and today I did the sink after cleaning my glasses (warm water and diluted dawn dish soap only) and flossing and brushing. Then I closed the drain and filled the sink with hot hot water and dish soap until it ran into the overflow holes. Then I opened the drain and hoped it was enough to flush out the remaining crap. Twice. That's probably an OCD thing. A less toxic drain cleaner I'm going to use has some kind of bacterial organisms that are supposed to eat organic matter. And I still haven't scrubbed the sink or counter which are also gross in their own ways.\n\nBreaking things into smaller more manageable tasks instead of trying to do them in one go from start to finish is called chunking. Turns out it's a useful strategy for OCD too. I hate cleaning so much that I will avoid it for as long as possible, but there's a point where the fear of contamination feels less important than not being able to take care of my general well-being. So a few times a year I throw caution to the wind and face it head-on. It feels pretty good. And thus begins another gradual decline into filth at which point the cycle will repeat.\n\nIt's been said plenty of times before: People who don't have OCD don't understand how much of a struggle it is, not just a personality quirk.\n\nNow that I've wasted like two hours writing this stupid yet sort of meaningful shit, I'm going to go take that shower.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share.",

And I’m on the very precipice of not being able to do this anymore. \nHe is a very busy human, and has always been. I’m aware of it, I accept it. He has hobbies, he has two jobs - one he hates and one started as a passionate hobby that now he gets paid to teach others occasionally. \n\nHe got a semi forced promotion at the job he hates earlier this year, and his stress levels have skyrocketed. He had some travel he has had planned for a very long time,Combine that with the second job and we have not had a ton of time together lately.\n \nAll of those things along with the need for family time, seeing his friends, his rabid workout schedule, and his routine - our sex life has suffered, I feel our connection has suffered, and I feel neglected and as if I am not on his priority list at all. \nI have internalized ADHD, I am medicated, I am in therapy, I feel as though I have been VERY patient and understanding and have communicated my needs very clearly. \nI would like him to call me, I want to hear his voice. Texts do nothing for me, I believe I had conveyed this clearly. \nYet he never does, not when he travels, not on his way to work or on his way home, I’ve tried to ask what the issue is. He says that he’s just getting his routine done. Why can’t he do both? \n\nHe did tell me that he has OCD, his house is spotless but yet my pet fur filled home doesn’t seem to bother him, he told me one of his big triggers is water spots. I have religiously wiped every surface I’ve ever dripped water on, I’ve attempted to clean his house to his pattern and standard every time I’m there. I personally believe that when you love someone you make the things that are important to them, important to you. \n\nMy asks of him are simple in my own opinion, call me and tell me you were thinking of me. Have an actual back and forth conversation(he tends to monopolize them and talk AT me and frequently forgets to ask how I am, or doesn’t ask any follow up detail questions about things I tell him, and I don’t manage to add the details cuz he’s off on another round of talking at me again), and when he is at my house i would like our time to be quality time, not tv time. \n\nWhen we have conflict conversations they go very well, he seems attentive, he seems to hear me and understand what I’m saying, it’s never a ‘fight’.\nI give him the solution outright - ‘here is the actionable change I need’ and I seem to be getting lip service with no action behind it. \n\nHe is a people pleaser by nature, and never wants to let anyone down, when asked he seems to genuinely believe he IS prioritizing me. \n\nI wonder if his schedule or time is his major fixation? I’m unsure about the lingo I apologize if I’m off in it. \nIf it is, how do I communicate to him that this is important, and if it’s us communicating poorly back and forth I’m willing to learn together.\n\nI also am just wholly uneducated on how OCD affects people, so if any of you wouldn’t mind educating me or linking me some resources I could learn from that would be amazing and i appreciate it. \n",

It gets so bad that I get an anxiety attack if I try to ignore it. \n\nNow due to so many absences on one of my Morning Classes the Instructor told me to drop the class. The consequence of dropping that class? I would lose eligibility to get Latin Honors upon graduation. Right now as I proceed with the decision I didn't feel as devastated as I thought compared to what I expected. It might be naïve on me but the career that I'm after probably prefers that I pass a specific set of exams rather than looking at grades. The thing is the biggest source of my anxiety has been chasing a goal (latin honours) that I know isn't really achievable based on my personality. So now I wonder if chasing for Latin Honors is an OCD thought?",

This specific theme was triggered by a really horrible dream I had years ago and kind of marked the „beginning“ of a period in my life in which my ocd was/is the most severe. \nDuring the therapy session I was, of course, honest about my situation and we talked about my many other compulsions/intrusive thoughts but like I said in the title, I couldn’t explicitly name the worst and most disturbing one of my obsessions. I tried to broadly describe it as „harming people“, or rather the fear of it (which still applies I guess) while also letting the therapist know that I can’t go into more detail with that. \n\nBut, I am now obsessing over the fact that I didn’t explicitly mention it (and ignoring the rest of the conversation in which we discussed my symptoms) and telling myself I basically lied to them and somehow tricked them into diagnosing me because I am secretly a bad person. I feel extremely anxious and I literally can’t stop thinking about it and a big part of me I doesn’t even believe this piece of paper that has my diagnosis on it.

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "For the 2 years I had this obsession that my home is contaminated, and my mattress. Why? Perfectionism, plus further stress in my life that got introduced, plus social isolation. So I started thinking about things I never thought about before. The moment I spent an entire week without talking with anyone was when I started thinking strangely. If the air quality isn't as fresh as in a forest, clearly, my home is contaminated. There has to be mold everywhere. You just can't see it. My sleep is bad. The obvious reason? My mattress is off gassing gasses, or has mold, too. I mean what else could be the reason?!\n\nIt dawned on me, however, after changing my mattress 20 times, after moving 5 times and my sleep still being bad, my air quality in my home still being perceived as bad, that the problem is in my head. There is no mold in my home. It is a newly built building, with humidity based automatic ventilation. \n\nThere is something deeply disturbing when you consider your own home to be contaminated. It makes you feel like you have no safe space. I wish no one to have contamination OCD. Please, seek help from a professional if you have contamination related obsessions, especially if you \\*know\\* they don't make rational sense. The key thing, as I've realised about OCD, is that you are aware of it. Use that awareness to your advantage.\n\nI was so obstructed in my own mind, so stubborn, that only taking SSRI for a few weeks made me realise what my problem is: My thought loops. It felt like my mind had gotten a hard reset,  started seeing them as what they were, nothing but obsessions. I realised though, that no matter SSRI or not, I still have to force my mind to think differently. So I stopped taking SSRI, as I realised I can tackle, or have to tackle, the problem with my mind regardless.\n\nWhat helped was rationalizing. I am a rational human being, attracted to Maths, logics. So why didn't I use that? So I rationalized: 1. I can't see mold in my home. That is a good sign. 2. Maybe there is mold somewhere. But even if it is, humans are capable of enduring mold because mold spores are everywhere. 3. The person who lived in my home before me somehow managed to live there without any issues. Apparently, it can't be that bad. And so on. Also, talking with other helped (but, be careful to not get them to validate your obsessions! This is a fatal mistake I made multiple times in the past, I tried to get other people to validate my obsessions. This is something you should \\*not\\* do, at all costs. Do not get other people to validate your obsessions. This is one reason why therapy regarding OCD is often something you should not share with other people, it rarely leads to good things. It helps, however, if you try to rationalize things, talk about positive things, other things etc.).\n\nThe biggest reason for my obsessions have been social isolation, however. I realised the more I talk with other people, get out of my mind, the less I thought about the obsessions. Talk with other people. If you can't find a therapist yet, talk with friends, do sports, leave your home and do things. You \\*have\\* to get out of your head. There is no other way. As hard as it seems, you have to force your mind to think about something else. Think of it less as \"I have to force myself to \\*not\\* think about the compulsion\". I realised that pathologizing OCD, or any mental anomaly, is not helpful. There is a key difference between mental and physical health related issues. Health related issues can often be treated by other people only. You take a pill, the pain goes away. Easy. Mentally related issues, however, in 99% involve you having to at least try to think differently. No one can get into your mind, turn knobs, and fix your mind. Meds help. Yes. They help \\*you\\* to think differently. In the end, it is still you who has to do the thinking differently process. You don't have to do this alone, again, do something \\*outside your head\\*, especially social interaction helps with getting out of your head and thinking about something \n\nI realised OCD is like a broken record. But the solution to a broken record is not to replay the record again and again and again until you are so sick of the song. Focussing on one obsession leads to understimulation until your mind is filled with nothing but with the obsession, leading to further understimulation, a never-ending cycle. You have to give your mind some different stimulation, you have to escape the thought loop, by social interactions, hobbies, sports etc. Yes, it sounds like the same boring advice everyone gives. I thought the same for many years. \"They don't truly understand me\". They don't. They don't have to. But they were still right in that regard that doing things, getting new stimulation, your mind needs new stimulation, helps. And for most people \"social interactions, sports, hobbies\" is said mental stimulation. It's boring. But it works. If you find something else to spend your day with that stimulates you mentally, that gets you out of your head, great! You have to do that, in the end, though.",

Exposure therapy rarely worked for me, as it never really stopped the intrusive contamination thoughts. Sometimes I felt like it made the thoughts worse. \n\nSo, I’ve been doing something else lately. I practice ‘acceptance’ and mix it with telling myself ‘nothing is going to happen’. I mean, hell…this is essentially what everyone else does in life. No one gets in a car and tells themselves “sure there’s a risk here, and I’ll handle it if I get injured in a car accident.” No…they play dumb and assume nothing is going to happen. Ignorance is bliss, right? \n\nSo, with that said…I’m trying to appeal more to ignorance than I have before. I know this goes against everything ocd therapy says…but no offense to traditional ocd therapy, it really wasn’t helping my intrusive thoughts. That and I smoke a lot of weed to help me just not care about things. \n\nEither way…I’ve improved. I’m never gonna cure myself of intrusive contamination thoughts…but if I can “not give a shit” about them more than I have in the past, then all the better. ",

        "Upvotes": 0,
        "Text": "I have a friend I have been talking to for quite a few years now. Most of our talks is me being a sounding wall for her issues so I guess it's also questionable whether I'm a friend or more of a therapist, but I digress. Anyway, I recently suggested that she'd seek out an OCD assessment. I can't quite remember why I thought she could have OCD, but the more I think about it, the more I am certain she has it. Anyway, she started to visit this clinic and has been there two times and they immediately told her she had OCD, but she's extremely adamant to accept that she could have it. \n\nFirstly, she says that she doesn't want any diagnosis on the records which I can understand, but secondly, she questions the assessors' credibility to diagnose OCD to the point I think it's unrealistic. The clinic she went to is a specialized clinic, and she just rebuffs everything the assessors say that she has OCD as just not accurate for her. She intentionally looks at every pigeonhole she can find to prove that they are overlooking details and she doesn't have OCD, at the same time she feels she's not herself qualified to tell whether she fits the diagnosis or not. The only other diagnosis I think would be possible for her would be GAD, but the more I read up on OCD vs. GAD, the more I feel OCD just describes her so well I can't imagine how it could be GAD, at least not as a standalone diagnosis without OCD. For the record, I'm autistic and while I don't have OCD myself, I guess I do the typical autistic thing where I just nosedive deep into anything I want to understand better just like I did with autism prior to my own diagnosis. I don't want to make myself seem like an expert because I'm not and I still don't quite fully understand the thinking style differences between GAD and OCD, but every example I see of OCD or advice provided for OCD, I just feel describes my friend to a T. \n\nThe thing about my friend is that she will create these extremely outlandish scenarios that I find are very unrealistic about real life events she's going through. When I started getting to know her, she was fixated on bodily experiences and was certain anything off was the potential sign of a terrible disease. She would frequently go to the doctor to the point you'd think she would be a hypochondriac. Come COVID-19, she was obsessed with not contracting COVID-19, would intentionally avoid all people whenever possible and felt extreme stress whenever she knew she was exposed to someone who was sick even if it wasn't COVID-19. It should be added that she's a generally healthy gen Z woman with no other known health problems that could be exacerbated by COVID-19 and she's not been sick in years. \n\nDuring more recent times, her focus has been more on work performance and her personal relationships. She was half-dating a guy for a while and he said he had done terrible things he didn't dare to tell her about and she assumed he was a murderer or something like that, and she became extremely anxious around him as she feared for her own safety. This is without ever knowing what horrible thing he believed he had done and having shown no interest in truly harming her. They were also in completely separate countries as she lives in Australia and he lives in the USA, so the likelihood of him tracking her in real life and attempt to harm her were extremely slim.\n\nAfter they broke off and she started a new job, she's extremely anxious about her work performance. She will blow up any error she makes out of proportion but not necessarily in the sense that she fears she will be terminated, but in the sense that it will harm the organization she works at or the people she's assisting through her job. An example includes how she realized it was wrong to film her computer screen during a training session, and after she realized she immediately deleted it. However, she was certain that a malicious app could gain access to the video during the short time frame it was on her phone, though she of course could not name which app that would be (she's also extremely concerned about cybersecurity in general, I should add), and from there, they could hack her organization's data files and gain access to personal customer information. I kept telling her how unrealistic this scenario was, especially because a) it takes time for an app to upload a video file due to their size and format; b) because it is a video, it requires a human to interpret the information, which also takes a lot of time. She said she couldn't tell that it was unrealistic, and I would say she has extremely poor insight in this regard, which is why I also feel she's in denial about it being caused by OCD, because she feels her thinking is realistic because it's based on *realistic events*. She keeps coming back to this as an argument why it can't be OCD, because OCD is that stereotypical thing you do like tapping your foot, counting numbers and the like, and she's not like that. She also says she doesn't make up scenarios that couldn't possibly be because all of this could happen and it could happen to *real people*, though I feel this isn't quite true, as per the potential data breach example. \n\nI think she thinks she has GAD and not OCD, possibly because she feels OCD is much more stigmatized, but I can't say for sure. She even said she can't have OCD because people with OCD suffer a lot from it, but I have been around her long enough to say she suffers a lot from her OCD. It can make it difficult for her to sleep or eat or focus on important tasks. In fact, I was the one who pushed her to seek help because I was concerned that she was going go through life this way and never find any support when she totally deserves it. It pains me to see how her quality of life and life prospects in general are limited just because of her OCD and the anxiety that comes with it. No one deserves to have to only experience that. \n\nI should add that another aspect which I don't at all think fits GAD is how extremely punitive she is towards herself. She constantly feels she must atone for wrongdoings even when they're extremely minor. Examples could include that she forgot to double-check something at work and even though she is not solely responsible for what happened she thinks she's a horrible person for letting these mistakes affect other people, and she places a lot of emphasis on the suffering it causes others without being able to move on from it. I should add that the potential suffering he actions cause could vary from something that to me seems extremely minor or annoying to something more serious e.g. having to re-post important paperwork or something like that, to something which could potentially lead to legal problems. \n\nShe keeps saying she must improve to be a better person because she's constantly acting selfish even when I tell her that no, the fact she worries so much about other people and feel this extreme pain to the point she must take on all responsibility for errors she is not solely responsible for, is a sign of great empathy. It makes her engage in behavior that is extremely inconvenient to her because of how she goes out of her way to act in a way she feels atones for what she's done, mostly by creating all these rituals at work to ensure no mistake ever slips through. She also often seems to feel she must confess to a person of authority, usually her team leader, to tell them what horrible thing she did, but she also fears doing so because she fears being terminated. Here I suppose I can see a potential intersection with GAD and OCD. \n\nI try to tell her that the majority of her issues are management issues as in it is the management whether it's her team leader or their boss, who need to create a clear work structure, and from what she's told me, a lot of her colleagues are slacking off A LOT, especially compared to her. Which makes sense insofar that she's always extremely hypervigilant about mistakes and they're not, because to them the job is just a job and mistakes are not the end of the world, whereas to her, they are. I say that if they don't care about these things then it's totally fine for her not to either, but she can't see it that way. She must always validate her own feelings about whatever she's done. I tell her to try to practice more self-love and that these mistakes are ok but I don't think she fully understands what this means, because in this self-righteous mindset, she can't see how anything she does can be neutral or good. Either she's totally good or totally bad, and she's firmly placed herself in the totally bad camp. It's made her a bit obsessed with the idea of self-work as well, where she must constantly be doing something to better herself and her character, even if it's only in spirit, and any failure results in this extreme self-punishment. \n\nNow she even questions if she should continue see the assessors because they were so quick to label her as having OCD and she doesn't believe them because how do they know? She feels they haven't done their job at doing a proper differential diagnosis even when I told her that maybe she's such an obvious case no such thing is needed as it was for me with autism. In the last session the psychologist or whatever their title is, even wrote down the thinking style of OCD to her on a whiteboard and explained how her thinking fits that pattern and how it looks like in non-OCD people. She also feels it was too easy and cheap to say the reason she's questioning the OCD diagnosis even if it's premature, is because she is compelled to do so because of her OCD. I tell her if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and walks like a duck it is likely a duck, but I think in her mind she really decided she was never OCD and it was just GAD and she's looking for any confirmation it is GAD or no diagnosis at all. \n\nI understand that it can be difficult to receive a mental health diagnosis that may stick with you for the rest of your life as an adult, I definitely had mixed feelings after my autism diagnosis even though I was certain at that point I was autistic simply because it is considered a disability and that just didn't immediately gel with my self-image, but I have this gut feeling that if she doesn't do this now, she will just go back to keep suffering and won't seek out help in a long time because it couldn't be OCD, and I'd hate to see that. I want to see her get the help she deserves so she can improve and live the life she actually dreams of. \n\nI'm sorry this became such a text wall though I'd say that's partially to blame on the 'tism as I've always been verbose in this way, and I am not quite sure what I'm looking for with this post, but maybe just some help or advice on how I can support my friend. I hope this doesn't break any rules as it said to not describe thinking in too much detail but I also don't know how to communicate why I think my friend is OCD without providing examples of why I think her thinking is so outlandish. \n\nI also want to say that I could of course be wrong about the OCD diagnosis, but I also feel that if the assessors said it was OCD in the first meeting she had and I feel everything I read about OCD just describes her so well, I don't see what else it would be. And I figured you guys in here probably know better what would work for you in her situation, as I don't have any issues with anxiety. \n\n",

        "Text": "I love my boyfriend and can see a future with him but I'm having a hard time accepting his mental illness. He has OCD and BPD. I have bipolar and anxiety disorders. I've been stable, medicated, and seeing a therapist for five years now. We've been together for three years. \n\nIt seems that if things are not perfect he freaks out. Mostly yelling and slamming doors. A lot of the anger stems from cleaning. I do not clean the house when he is home because he gets anxious if I'm walking around while he sits, the noise from doing dishes irritates him, he cannot stand the sounds of the washer/dryer and dishwasher, and he watches me the entire time I'm cleaning and without fail will seek out something I did wrong. \n\nI was a professional cleaner for some time and I like to keep a clean home. I know what I'm doing when it comes to cleaning the apartment. However, somehow I always \"clean wrong\" in his opinion. For example, he doesn't believe I wipe the crumbs on a counter into a paper towel, he thinks I brush it all to the ground. As soon as I wipe the counter he goes back and runs his hand over the counter and looks for crumbs on the floor. Somehow he always finds a crumb but throws it away without showing me. \n\nThe other night he said the kitchen floor was filthy with crusty food and I needed to clean it ASAP. This was one day after I vacuumed and I had not cooked in the kitchen yet. I went to the kitchen with a flashlight and saw a single crumb (which I picked up). I ran my feet along the ground to see if I could feel what he was referring to and I didn't feel anything. \n\nI mostly clean when he is at work and I have the day off. I honestly dread him coming home on those days. It feels like I'm going to throw up leading up to the time his shift ends. I know he is going to see the place looking clean and find something I did wrong. When he points something out he will wipe down everything again not just the \"mistake\" he saw. He will argue and freak out for an hour before going to his room, not speaking to me. All I do during this time is apologize for not doing it how he wants so he'll stop yelling. \n\nI have trauma about aggressive outbursts from men so I just totally shut down and start crying when he yells. Then he gets even more angry. He says I just sit in silence when he is trying to get through to me and I'm not giving him any reason to trust me with cleaning. He thinks I'm not cleaning right on purpose to force him to do everything. \n\nEventually, when he calms down he apologizes for his reaction but it never changes. It has gotten to the point that I'm so anxious about cleaning that I simply don't want to do it. He gets mad that I don't clean enough or take initiative to clean and he says he has to do everything. I respond by explaining the reasons I can't clean when he is home and he says I should just ask his permission when I want to clean. Whenever I ask permission to clean he says I can do it later so he can go to his room with his headphones. Later rolls around and he either forgets to give me permission or I ask again and he gets angry that I'm rushing him. \n\nHe is on depression medication but has not seen a therapist in years. I've asked him to see a therapist in the past and he says it doesn't work for him. I don't want to leave him because I believe he loves me more than anyone ever could. He doesn't judge me for anything, he supports me when I'm having a hard time, I love hanging out with him when he isn't angry, we have so much in common. What do I do?",

This has also been great. \n\nThe past few months I've been really down, and OCD/intrusive thoughts are at an all time high, which makes my depression worse. \n\nMy doctor recommended adding a very low dose of adderall to 1.) help the depression and 2.) help with the OCD\n\nI'm not really excited about the idea of taking adderall with welbutrin since they're both stimulants. But if it works, I guess what harm could it be?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences. ",

        "Text": "I am writing this to try and convey my mindset and how it affects my life. I don’t know why I have OCD and this mindset, but it is what it is. Most people as far as I am aware will have a fleeting worry and then go on about their lives. They might think ‘oh I hit my head, I hope that didn’t cause brain damage haha’ but to me such worries become incredibly real and debilitating. I will genuinely believe that something I am thinking about or have done will come true, it is not even a question of if but when. This can seem extremely illogical to outsiders, and this is links back to what I said earlier. Most people do not experience this, their thoughts come and go with no real weight to them. For me this isn’t the case, all of my worries invoke a sense of doom and existential dread.\n\nThis can make life incredibly challenging; most people work with a future in mind, but now I believe a future for myself is non-existent. I feel that I will die or develop a neurodegenerative disease. And thus, what is the point in doing anything that would improve my life in the long-term. If you knew that you had a few years left to live you would not care nearly as much about how your present actions will impact your future. This is how I feel almost constantly, there a brief moment where I feel that everything will be OK but those are few and far between. Now I have recognized this pattern, there will be moments where I will focus on the things typical people worry about; how much money will I make, will I get a girlfriend, have kids etc… But I know this is fleeting and I simply accept that it will eventually come to an end and I will go back to worrying about what I was worrying about before. To me my thoughts are reality, I cannot dissociate from them. I’ve tried CBT, and all the other bullshit, nothing helps. You cannot convince me that I have not caused neurological damage to myself through self-injurious behaviours, no amount of CBT (copium) will change the FACTS. If I had driven a nail through my hand in an accident you could not CBT me out of believing there is a nail driven through my hand.\n\nI’m just so fed up, it’s endless. One things after another. I’ve been stuck on this ‘obsession’ for a year now and it isn’t going away, it’s only getting worse. Tried numerous psychologists, books, pregabalin, anti-psychotics, SSRIs, at what point do you say enough is enough.",

I still feel as though my house is covered in third hand smoke though, even though he did it outside. I’m washing my hands so often that they are cracked and bleeding. I don’t hug my partner or sit with him as I still think of him as contaminated. I cringe when he holds the baby even though I know he hasn’t smoked and his clothes and hands are clean.

I’m not currently enrolled with any psychiatrist, my primary has been managing my script for the last year. Should I just start back up taking them? Maybe it’s time for a reevaluation? Im 34 and was officially diagnosed at 32 after a severe episode. I thought I was going to be fine after feeling stable for the last year once finding cymbalta- 100% not fine off of it. I cried for two hours this morning in pure rage because my husband didn’t do the laundry the way I need it done (bless his heart). This is ridiculous. Shouldn’t feel like my world is going to end or I am going to die because a spoon is in the wrong spot, or my work files got out of order. I made such good progress with meds combined with exposure therapy and CBT but it’s not proving helpful right now at all with my physical responses to my internal stressors. Thinking I should start my script back up and seek another evaluation? Is it common to have to reevaluate? I really thought I had a good grip on things but I messed up cutting off my meds. If I’m being honest- I just got tired of taking them everyday but I’m realizing how crucial they are for me. Any input appreciated. ",

And I mean *any* job; I was lucky enough to once have a WFH job with zero deadlines and I still cracked under the pressure of my own thoughts. If I'm being quite honest, the OCD doesn't even feel like just intrusive thoughts anymore, but rather a separate identity with its own personality and interpretation of memories. I've suffered from this crap since childhood, so I have no doubt it's screwed up my mental development to that extent.\n\nI started a part-time retail job last December, and I've been enjoying the opportunity to work with a product that I like (computers). What I haven't been enjoying is the absolutely toxic working environment. So much pressure from higher-ups to upsell meaningless bullcrap. So much micromanaging and attempts to get me in trouble from coworkers trying to suck up. And of course, the occasional problematic customer, although I've honestly found these to be the least stressful of the bunch. I'm not a violent person whatsoever, but my disdain for this working environment has resulted in harm OCD festering in the back of my mind. And this past week, after experiencing a string of triggering events both in and out of the store, the OCD overtook me. I was working my shift, and I could feel my body tense up in response to the unwanted thoughts of hurting those around me. It felt like I could involuntarily strike at any moment. So I left. Said I wasn't feeling well, haven't been back since.\n\nThe OCD personality is still in control, and it wants me to self-sabotage. I was offered a generous holiday attendance bonus, and I've likely lost that now, so why not throw everything else away while we're at it? There's no way I can handle the upcoming Black Friday traffic, so I should just quit now. Or get them to fire me. Or whatever. I don't care anymore. I can still access the thoughts and memories of my non-OCD half while it's taking a backseat, and it actually agrees: why should I keep trying to save money for a future that's not worth fighting for? A future where I'm constantly fluctuating between these 2 emotional states until it finally kills me? No thanks. I don't fight battles I can't win.",

I can't buy items containing the letters of my beloved people, I think something bad will happen to them... etc. Usually it is like this, \"If I do this / buy this, I will be distracted and something bad will happen to my beloved people or to me.\"    And also, I am not a religious person but, I can't do what my religion prohibits. Again, I think something bad will happen to my beloved people.\n\n  \nMy OCD is kind of magical thinking.

I usually have a great grasp on why it’s important to at least delay compulsions, reassurance seeking being detrimental, etc. But this theme gets me stuck. This theme is the main underlying one that has come and gone throughout my life since OCD became prominent in my teens, but it’s been over a year and it hasn’t really changed. Sometimes my OCD would go into ‘remission’ for a while, or be there but pretty bearable, and I miss how much I’d appreciate those times.\n\nI don’t understand what the first step to make is (putting aside counselling because no free time and very very long waiting list for someone likely not very helpful in my experience. And putting aside medication for now as need to sort out a new dr as the current one made a mistake with my last meds and I no longer trust her) - like in my head, what should be my next steps?\n\nI tend to get close to a person/people, then get stuck with thoughts about their inevitable deaths. If I’m not currently fixated on a friend’s death, it’s my own. Not in the way that I’m scared leaving the house in case something kills me - but the fact it will happen one day so what’s the point in life? That my friends will die too, so what’s the point and how will I cope? The compulsions to deal with this are saying things to myself in my head - usually I’ll have a thought that makes me feel better about it, my brain will latch onto that, and it gets repeated word for word, over and over until I get the ‘just right’ feeling. If I’m alone I might whisper the words aloud instead. I’ll write down these thoughts too, and compulsively read over them.\n\nI don’t know the right next move… surely not allowing these thoughts in is avoidance and making things worse? Plus I can only keep it up for a while, usually at work as I have to. But I don’t know how to allow these thoughts in and/or accept them when existence is such a strange and uncertain concept. Allowing the thoughts in means getting stuck in rituals. The goal of going over and over the thoughts is to feel okay and happy and fine again (at least in OCD’s ironic way) but it gets hard to think straight. And the more I get that ‘just right’ feeling from a compulsion, the more tempting it gets to do the compulsion again, and I get stuck in a cycle. I’m not sure where to go from here and my thoughts feel very jumbled so I’m sorry if this is hard to read.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice please!",

Fast foward 6 months later after my anxiety worsened even further and I started seeing no longer only the brief complex faces that would appear in my vision for a split second but rather also sustained patterns of simple faces. By simple I mean that my brain automatically sees a face in something as simple as groups of three dots arranged in the shape of a triangle. I see a face in it immediately and cannot unsee it once noticed. This happens dozens of times in a day and what frustrates me the most is that it's not getting any better.

Just came back now since I remembered a very important part of my journey to remission.\n\nOcd feeds off uncertainty. You tell yourself before a compulsion, despite knowing it is ridiculous, that \"better safe than sorry\"\n\nUncertainty is a great weapon to use against ocd itself.\n\nWhen your ocd tells you to for example, touch the door a certain way to save your family, you simply ask, what if touching the door this certain way is what will hurt my family instead of helping it? Make that thought feel more real. \n\nNow your emotions and fears are UNCERTAIN about what to do, touch the door a certain way or DONT touch the door a certain way. What now? Well your brain will give up and suddenly the compulsion loses a lot of meaning, making it easier to face.\n\nAfter all, how do you know that touching the door a certain way will hurt or save your family? Both a equally as likely statistically speaking. And the previous time you did the ritual and nothing happened? Well maybe you family actually was hurt or still about to get hurt, you just dont know it yet. You have no proof to prove otherwise.\n\nThis way of thinking takes a way a lot of strength from ocd thoughts and makes exposure therapy way more effective.",

I had been steadily on my Zoloft for two years (150 mg) and when I lost my health insurance and then my access to medication I was terrified. I didn't know what to do, I was in medical debt so I didn't think I could get help through a mental hospital like I had done in the past. I also was struggling with fear of my adoptive parents thinking I'm too much and kicking me out so I tried to manage on my own (epic fail). I tapered off my meds but it didn't really soften the landing as much as I would have liked.\n\nAlmost instantly my cotards delusion was so back so bad I could no longer get myself out of it. Had devastating effects I dropped to 77 pounds and I barely had the energy to walk. I went in patient after I realized that there was no way I could stabilize myself and I was really really sick and needed help. It felt my alarms bells going off in my head over a series of days and I had a conversation with my momma and she said something about it being terrifying and I was so shocked she could see how scary it was. It really shook me up I felt seen in a way I've never felt before.\n\nOne trip to the psych ward and I'm finally freakin back. Never again, I would rather suck on dirty toes then exist in my unmedicated mind. And the best part? My symptoms from OCD are nearly unnoticable!! \n\nLet this be your reminder to not stop your medication, your meds aren't meant to make your symptoms completely disappear , there would be no way to measure progress if they did. Going off your meds will ALWAYS be worse than reaching out for help from a doctor or health clinic. ",

Yesterday I finally told my partner everything, it was the first time I’d told anyone about any of this and he was really understanding, helped me put lots of things in context and also said that I’d probably feel better if I had the support of my friend group. I want to tell them all about this but I’m nervous to because it feels like just baring a huge part of my soul, I’d feel really exposed, and also because of the possible relationship OCD - I basically obsess over whether I’m going to be found out as being secretly a bad friend, or if I’m talking too much or being annoying, or if I’ve accidentally said something offensive (and I look back at messages, look up words and replay interactions in my head to make sure I haven’t) and will socially withdraw when that obsession makes me feel anxious and guilty, until I start feeling lonely and begin socialising again. I feel like if I tell my friends all that, I don’t want them to think of me differently or feel like they have to change how they talk to me so I feel stuck on how much I should mention or if I should even say anything.\n\nIf I do decide to tell them, I want to maybe have some pointers ready on how to give support just in case they don’t know how, but I haven’t gotten that far in my research (apart from topics like reassurance).

And it sounds so silly, because it’s over the littlest things that my mind starts malfunctioning. Every day feels like I’m just surviving through, trying to get past whatever fog has come over my brain. I can no longer make decisions, no matter how small they are. I will spend hours upon hours agonizing over choices and most of my day I’m in a state of limbo. I will stand at the grocery store in the same aisle for god knows who long because I’m unable to make a choice. I went to the store to get the same candle I always get. But I just stare at the number of sizes this candle comes in. And I stare and stare and go through mentally why this option may be wrong or why the other option might be wrong. Some of them had three wicks instead of two, maybe that should factor into my decision. I’ll sit in parking lots for 30+ minutes doing nothing but trying to decide what I’m going to do when and where I’m going to go. It’s the silliest thing but it has become so extreme that I’ve barely been eating. I’m a college student for context. “Should I make dinner now?” *takes out ingredients. “No, I should make this other dinner I had planned for later in the week. Wait, I have no time to make a dinner right now. Maybe I should make coffee and breakfast for dinner and stay up until I finish my assignment. Or maybe I should go to sleep now and wake up early and just eat then instead.” And I spent from 8:30 pm to midnight going back and forth, procrastinating my work, unable to make a decision about food, and stressing. Sometimes I’ll just sit down and think and think why can’t I organize my thoughts why can’t I just decide why am I so dysfunctional. I haven’t eaten today. I gave up, brushed my teeth and I’m in bed now on my phone. I didn’t eat much yesterday either. I feel like I’m in such a blur. These past two months, I had to stop and realize the seasons were changing and how it had started getting dark so soon. It seemed like I missed it all, bc I had been surviving instead of living. My brain just keeps shutting down. I feel helpless. \n\nI do have OCD but I’m not sure if whatever is going on with me is related? But it sucks hours from my day.

However, I wouldn't know how to start or where to look.\n\nSo I was wondering if there are other people also craving this, if people have found something like this and how, what kind of support systems do you use?",

I struggle mainly with compulsions, checking behaviour to be more precise\n\nWhen I add songs to my playlist I need to check it's om the right playlist 2-20 times. Every fucking song, which takes a LOT of time. It needs be checked in the 2 table. Everything needs to feel right, no anxiety (which is basicly impossible), can't be distracted, no shifts in beats, done at the right time. Can't be after middle in the song \n\nSo I got this amazing idea that I tested how it would turn out if I checked ZERO times. I saved A LOT of time. Then I filmed the 20-25 songs, checked if they were on the right playlists. The success rate was 95,8 percent. Perfect. Then I did it again with the next 20-25 songs, 100% successrate. Next 20-25 songs, same result. Next 20-25 songs, 100% again\n\nSo I was like \"Okay So it basicly makes no difference, beside increased anxiety and using 10 times as much time. I know my ocd is just fucking me up now\". But I still can't, and now my new compulsion is just filming me going through 20-25 songs, checking if they're on the right playiists. And I keep thinking about the 95,8% one time. What if it's my favorite song and doesn't come on the right playlists? I hate this So much. The uncertainty is so unplesant\n\nI have overcome so many things. Depression, BED, weed and nicotine addiction. But this is the one thing that seems to stick with me",

I often feel so alone and misunderstood. \n\nMy OCD is very much compulsion-based as opposed to the more common obsessions-based OCD subtypes. I often feel the urge to do things “just right” as in an almost physical sensation to touch or press or move something until it gives me that “just right” sensation. I feel almost physically unable to pull myself away until the compulsion is complete. It’s extremely annoying because there is no way to reason with a sensation. It’s once taken me over two hours just to plug my phone in “just right”, back when things were extremely bad.\n\nPlease tell me I’m not the only one. I’m tired of living this way.",

Recently, while reading a book where the author described being beaten by her mother, I felt this intense urge to come up with countless explanations for why her mother might have acted that way.\n\nIt’s frustrating because deep down, I know I understand these concepts, but my OCD convinces me otherwise.",

I am considering taking a year out of university because I physically can’t continue in this manner and I feel like I’ve never actually lived my life as I desired without crippling anxiety / obsessive anxiety and depressive symptoms. The ADHD combined with the (suspected) OCD genuinley makes my life a living hell and I keep acting really out of character at university and I can’t deal with intrusive thoughts that either everyone is looking at me and making fun of me, or that I’m going to do something embarrassing and everyone will know, or that everyone hates me etc. It’s literally so dumb sometimes. If I hear people laughing behind me I have to check that I haven’t shit my pants💀💀💀. I literally can’t approach people I’m interested in romantically because of that 1 “flirting vs harrassment” meme and the fact that I’m incredibly insecure makes me ruminate about the possibility of making a woman uncomfortable because my brain tells me I’m not attractive enough.

I developed ocd about 4 years ago and it’s just gotten more extreme everyday. Before then i had a super messy room and showered every 2 days (I was 14 and had a pretty absent alcoholic father). Then i just gradually became more and more of a clean person. Especially the past few months it just keeps getting worse. I might sound kind of dramatic but it’s really hard to never truly feel clean. I shower every morning and night the morning takes 45min and night takes 1hour and 15min+. I have to do the same exact routine every time very thoroughly or i don’t feel clean enough. I have to do a bunch of stuff as a part of showering like clean my room and wash my water bottle. I used to wash my hair twice a week now i can’t go more than 2 days even thought it takes 3+hours to wash and dry my curlyish hair. When i get out i have to clean every single surface in my room. clean my vanity, candle warmer, candles, laptop, nightstand, dresser, nightstand drawers, lint roll my bed, even my phone and apple watch and vacuum every single day. When im doing my skincare i have my hair in a tight ponytail and repeatedly brush my hair back with a comb after every step because i cringe at anything getting in my hairline. I wash my sheets/comforter and even curtains every 6-7 days. It takes me an entire day every week just to deep clean my room on top of what i do daily. I can’t ever step on the floor without socks i step out of the shower into my socks. I use a new towel everytime i shower. If i didn’t wash or clean something myself it feels dirty. I have nothing on my walls and no nick nacks or decorations because having anything but a candle looks cluttered to me. Everything in my room is white so i can see if it’s at all dirty. I even clean my scale/treadmill every single thing in my room has to be cleaned with a rag with cleaner then a dry one. Even after that just seeing the little specs left from the rag bothers me. I wash my shoes, i clean my charging cords i scrub my brush and combs every-time i shower. I take every single organizer and the stuff in them out of my nightstand drawer and clean them. And every single thing i do takes me so long. It’s so exhausting having to do all this every day and still not feeling clean. I guess just wondering if anyone has similar experiences and if they stopped having so many conditions to being “clean”.\nOn top of all this also have other types of ocd, social anxiety, anxiety, major depression, and at this point maybe slight agoraphobia and my ocd isn’t even the worst illness so it all just works against each other.",

I'm 18 and I’ve developed this intense hyperawareness of my eye movements because of somatic OCD, and it’s driving me up the wall. *It feels like every time I try to move my eyes, it’s a huge struggle, like my mind is frozen and won't let them flow naturally across the page. There’s also this constant subconscious doubt in my mind, making me question if I’m doing it wrong or if something’s off.* Whenever I try to read, I can’t help but notice exactly where my eyes are going and how they’re moving over each word. What used to feel natural has turned into a slow, stressful task that’s completely breaking my focus.\n\nEven just looking at a book feels heavy, like there’s some weird pressure there before I even start reading. I can’t just sit back and flow through the words. I know this is something I shouldn’t have to think about, but I’m stuck in this exhausting loop of trying to control it. It feels like I’m losing a basic ability, and I don’t know how to get it back.\n\nI haven’t told my family about this because they’re not the most supportive, and honestly, I feel guilty even thinking about telling them. I’m just at a loss and don’t know who to turn to. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of hyperawareness? If you’ve found *any* way to make it easier, please, Any advice or shared experiences welcome :)  I feel so stuck.\n\nThanks for listening.",

        "Text": "Hello all, newbie here. 45, male, living in Denmark, born in the UK, married, two small kids. I'd like to ask the community for thoughts and recommendations.\n\nI always considered myself unusual, but not in a good way, as a bit of antisocial and introvert. Strange thoughts and habits with an agitated beehive in my head all the time. I assumed this was normal and learnt to live with - until a few months ago, when I had to see a therapist, as I couldn't take it anymore. There were a series of bad events around me, and I finally crashed.\n\nFirst, I got diagnosed with a moderate depression. Then digging deeper came a diagnosis of ADHD, afterwards OCD, and last a mild paranoid personality disorder.\n\nFor about a decade now I have a massive sleep apnea, well treated with a CPAP machine. I had two years of extreme cloudy brain and irritability while diagnosed. Afterwards came a year of insomnia.\n\nWith all this somehow I maintain a relatively normal life, working as a software engineer, having a stable marriage and raising the small ones. All the chaos is well confined inside.\n\nThe depression is slowly improving with a high dose of SSRI medication. I got Ritalin for ADHD, which did some magic. I honestly don't notice much, but people around me absolutely do. I became more tolerable and enjoyable as a person. They remind me if I miss a dose. I don’t know how my wife has been able to go through all this, we love each other.\n\nI feel that the OCD (and somewhat the paranoid disorder) is the most debilitating. It can explain why I am so bad in relationships, why I don't have friends, why I always get distracted and engaged in useless activities, etc. Everything needs to be arranged around me in a set baseline and everybody needs to be precisely on time. Sharp focus or creative work are a fantasy. Often I try to keep my brain busy (like following through chains of thought) just not to be exposed to the brain noise. \n\nWorst of all is that I lost motivation generally in life, about a decade ago. It has put my career in decline, diminished personal life goals, lack of hobbies and so on. I just can't get myself to go to the gym to work out, even though it would be essential.\n\nUnderstanding all this, I ask the community for ideas – how to deal with this situation, the thoughts, and obsessions. Am I too old to change? to relearn motivation, have a clear head, to build friendships?\n\nThank you all.",

And I was thinking over that, and at one point I was doubtful that it was sexual assault, assuming that the person on the bottom wasn't upset or reluctant and was just non expressive. \n\nAnd then I had a thought that was like \"even if it is sexual assault, then that wouldn't disprove your belief in women's rights, it wouldn't mean women are creepier than men on average\". The context to this is that my ocd makes me afraid that I will deny something is sexual assault if I believe that it being sexual assault will make the rate of perpetration between men and women equal, so that my philosophy (feminism and the idea of female disadvantage in society ) isn't threatened. So the thought I listed above was sort of a test. It was to see if my opinion on whether or not the above scenario is sexual assault would change if I believed it being sexual assault wouldn't threaten my worldview. \n\nBut then I thought it would be sexual assault, so my view did change, so I \"failed\" the test. So now my ocd is saying I'm a potential rapist, because I'd deny something is sexual assault if it doesn't fit my worldview. For the record I'm not even at a point where this scenario would occur as I'm young and have never been in a relationship, but I'm afraid of being in a relationship and being a perpetrator.\n\n\nHow do I deal with these rumination spirals?

I’m scared that my ocd will cause me to act on the terrible thoughts and it genuinely scares me because I would never hurt anyone but I’m scared of going crazy because of it. Another fear I’ve had is becoming schizophrenic. I have noticed that without medication my ocd is more manageable. I’ve only ever been on anti depressants for it and I don’t think that’s what I need. I also have realized that around full moons, my period, and lack of sleep which is all currently happening. A full moon happens soon and also my period comes soon so it s absolutely through the roof.

He didn’t take care of his health at all for example). After he died (when i was 13) I wanted to be like him personality vise. He seemed like such a great person character vise. That’s why I’m so scared and paranoid to hurt people accidentally (physically or emotionally). That’s also why I’m scared to damage things (like accidentally (without realizing) scratch a car or other things). That’s why I spiral down in these overthinking nightmares. It doesn’t make it easier but it feels like I made a step in the right direction. I guess I’m scared he would be disappointed/ hate me. I’m 23 and it’s still so important to me",

But my ocd finds comfort in blaming random things for my failure, if my failure is out of control and I tried my absolute hardest. Because I need an explanation for everything. Being what I consider as a “failure” is impossible to me in my eyes, so maybe it was because of the nail polish I wore, since I can’t figure out any other reason.",

I’d love for you, people all around the world, to help me show what OCD feels like, using a simple line on a blank page.\n\n**Here's how you can participate:**\n\n1. Grab a small white piece of paper (preferably about A4 size) and a (black) marker.\n2. Draw an abstract line that expresses what OCD feels like *for you*. There’s no right or wrong way – let it come naturally.\n3. Take a photo of your drawing.\n4. If you feel comfortable, sign your initials in the bottom right corner.\n5. Send me the photo in a private message (since sending an image is not allowed here).\n\nI’ll be collecting your line-art, removing the backgrounds digitally, and arranging them into an ever expanding grid to create a collaborative artwork. The goal is to visually express our personal, often hidden experiences with OCD.\n\nThank you so much for considering participating and the effort! Let’s turn our experiences into something visible and impactful. I will be posting the result in early spring, as I try to collect as many line-art as I can.  \nPrimarily this project is aimed to be digital, but in case it will end up being a physical experience in any way, of course I will share these results with you too :). Feel free to ask any questions down below or privately. Thanks again everybody that feels resonance to join, (my OCD ironically made it difficult to post here, but here we finally are, haha).\n\nView the examples I made here for reference:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/T0kedfW](https://imgur.com/a/T0kedfW)",

        "Text": "Hi all. I am a 26 year old man who has been diagnosed with OCD and MDD as well as GAD. My first bad bout with OCD was when I a small child (shoes being tied evenly and head shaking). My fear of germs got so severe that I was washing my hands 100 times a day if not more. My mom threatened with taking me to the doctor for it and that scared me so badly i was able to get rid of the OCD at the time. Fast forward a decade and I thought I was cured (lol) so I got a job servicing porta potties not thinking about it. That resparked hypochondriasis within me that eventually led to contamination and all that good stuff. That went on for 3 or 4 years (started seeing a therapist around two years into it) but was never able to make progress. I eventually developed intrusive thoughts (sexual) regarding underage people. Those thoughts scared me so badly I finally talked to my therapist and convinced myself to get on medication  (Prozac). Took a few attempts to find Prozac but it helped. Prozac began helping and thought I was out free. So I started smoking weed again. I also struggle with addiction issues (weed) and use it to cope and forget about my problems. The following year or so was amazing. I was able to live and enjoy life while smoking weed, which I never thought I'd be able to do. But at some point, I began experiencing what I believe to be serotonin syndrome, so my dumbass thought it was a good idea to continue the weed and discontinue Prozac.  The next 8 months or so I unknowingly fell down into a deep depression, and my ocd symptoms essentially completely disappeared. I also stopped smoking weed again. Eventually, the depression got bad enough that I began trying to find natural supplements to help me get out of this depression. I tried Lions mane mushrooms, which caused my intrusive thoughts to return, so I stopped. I also tried microdosing shrooms to see if that would help, and it just caused my intrusive thoughts to return as well. At that point,  I had enough, so I went to my doc (GP, not a psych) and restarted Prozac. I was on 40mg first time around, but restarted with 10mg in hopes it would  be all I needed. I made it three weeks with Prozac until I was anxious enough that I thought I should stop (no intrusive thoughts, however) just a lot of anxiety from a big issue I was dealing with from work at the time, which I feel may have been the reason there were no intrusive thoughts, but I may be overthinking. So I also stopped Prozac. Then I tried sertaline at 50mg. By day 4, my hypochondriasis was popping up and I had the worst intrusive thoughts I could've imagined that night. So I stopped that as well. But by this point, I had convinced myself that it's no longer my OCD/anxiety and that I am actually this monster my brain is telling me I am. So I began drinking alcohol every night to feel some semblance of peace, but used weed to get away from alcohol because alcoholism runs in my family. I just recently quit weed once again, probably for the 30 time at this point in my life. I restarted going to therapy but I absolutely cannot shake this deep feeling in my core of me being a monster. I can't get the intrusive thoughts under control and I feel like an utter failure in every aspect of my life, and I feel like I am not worthy of anyone's help. Don't hangout with friends like I used to or do hobbies I used to enjoy. I don't know what to do at this point. Even talking to my therapist about my problems just makes me seem like worse of a person to myself. Suicidal ideation has come and gone, but I'm so convinced that there is no hope and I am this monster my brain makes me out to be. I don't know if I'm venting or asking for help, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read through this shit show.\n\n\n",

        "Text": "I've noticed that I've been having intrusive thoughts about people from my past. Last year I had a lot of thoughts and even had false memories and went crazy for days, months. My psychiatrist prescribed risperidone, but I was taking Revoc and Depakene. After about four months, the medication wasn't doing me any good and I had to stop. The thoughts came back stronger two weeks ago when I was at a pizza place with my boyfriend and I saw a guy I'd talked to about four years ago and who lost me on the first date (thank God because later I realized he was a jerk and not a good fit for me). Lots of thoughts like: \"You think he's cute,\" terrifying images and intrusive thoughts about other people I've talked to. I feel like if I don't tell my boyfriend these thoughts, I'm automatically cheating on him, that I'm a traitor and everything bad. On Sunday, this damn human being sent me a message apologizing for being a jerk and I immediately blocked him, not only for what he said to me, but for being a bad person and for being terrified of people like him. Now, intrusive thoughts come to me that I liked receiving the message (far from it, I know I didn't like it, I want to distance myself from people who hurt me), and the guilt for these thoughts keeps coming up and with intrusive memories, that I never want to remember again, remembering things like: insecurities, memories of the messages on my cell phone, the bad feelings I had and the harm he did to me at the time. I'm feeling like a cheating girlfriend, but I never felt anything for him, just neediness and I'm in the loop now of convincing the thoughts....\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)",

        "Text": "I (20M) was with my now ex (20F) for a year and a half. It was a really intese relationship (also my first real relationship) with a lot of ups and downs, but i really loved her. During the time we were together i struggled a lot with retroactive jealousy OCD and obsessions that were centered around her in general, which often prevented me from being at peace in the relationship.\n\nI initiated the breakup because i felt like i needed a break and i wanted to explore more. After a month (during which we both saw someone else) i changed my mind and realised i wanted to be with her. We met again a few times and she made me think we were on the same page and we would get back together (she said she loved me, missed me, invited me to sleep over, said she wanted to try again), just to later reject me  by text in the most heartbreaking way possible. It hurt me so much.\n\nIt's been three weeks no contact and i feel like i'm going insane. The way the breakup happened and the fact that she's dating someone else now (the one she saw during our break) are killing me. Every obsession i had during the relationship is now back stronger and i can't even process anything properly because of this. I get constant intrusive thoughts about what went wrong and why, what we could have been, wether we will get back together (and wether i would actually want it or not), wether she was \"the one\", her and her new bf. One of my main themes is sex, i wonder if i will ever find someone with whom sex is as great, and the intrusive thoughts about her having sex with her new bf are a different kind of pain.\n\nI spent the whole relationship worrying about her past and now i keep worrying about what she does after the relationship. And i keep overanalyzing everything without getting anywhere, just like usual with OCD. I'm so tired and i just want this obsession to stop. I can't function right now, i spend my whole days ruminating and crying. I also miss her so much in every aspect and i still can't accept that the breakup happened, even tho i wouldn't want to get back with her after how she treated me and how she didn't give a shit about it.\n\nI wrote this post mostly because i needed to vent. I'm in therapy already and i have talked about this with my therapist but i felt like i needed to write everything down. Any advice / support is really appreciated :))",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, this sub has helped me so much and I’m reaching out to see if anyone feels the same way or has any advice.\n\nWhenever I call in sick, I feel an immense amount of guilt. To the point where I usually just go to work or school while not feeling 100% and then it takes longer to recover. If I do something productive like go to school/work while sick, after the task is done I feel like I can finally let myself rest. When I’m sick on my days off I feel so relieved that I don’t have to tell my work. \n\nI have recently learned about hyper responsibility as a theme in OCD which honestly makes a whole lot of sense because I thought I was just an intense perfectionist. I feel like I need to be perfect all the time, especially at school (I am in my last year of my bachelors). If I make a typo in an assignment I will agonize over it, or if I feel like I have done something to annoy my professor I literally will stress so hard I cry. It is so so hard for me to rest when I don’t feel like I “earned it”.\n\nI have been sick a lot this semester (probably because I once again cannot let myself rest) and I have had to call in sick to work in hopes of getting better for a presentation I was supposed to have today. I woke up feeling absolutley awful and emailed to let my prof know and she was very understanding about it but I cannot shake the feeling of immense guilt. I was supposed to do my presentation earlier in the semester but my prof has been sick the last few weeks and I’ve had to move it around a few times (which has absolutely done numbers on my responsibility OCD). \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone else with this theme of OCD can relate. My friends tell me it’s okay to rest and take time when you’re feeling sick but they don’t get how that sounds like a foreign concept to me. It literally just does not work in my brain. \n\nOCD has been the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to deal with (I’ve been to therapy for my harm OCD which has definitely helped), and any advice would be appreciated. Or if you’ve experienced this it would just be great to feel less alone in this. TIA :) ",

        "Text": "First time posting on Reddit, hello!! I don’t personally know anyone else with the disorder so it’s hard to find commonality in my personal life or anyone to relate to, so I thought I’d post here. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post something like this, I’m going through a lot so it’s kind of just word vomit. For years I’ve had suspicions that I have OCD and after seeing a therapist for about a year, I was diagnosed a couple months ago. I had originally started seeing her because I unfortunately suffered the loss of a parent a few years ago and finally decided to go. I was doing well in therapy but I had started EMDR this past summer which exacerbated my symptoms and made everything worse. There are a lot of beliefs I have about myself and the world around me that limit me greatly, but I could never figure out where they came from so that’s why we started that treatment. I can only afford to see my therapist every two weeks so not much work was getting done and I just consistently felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown as we were basically working on what seemed like an open wound in my brain. \nNow, it seems like things are only getting worse. A trigger can send me into a hermit state for weeks and I’ve been told I need to go back on medication (I was previously medicated as a teenager after being diagnosed with depression but after losing my parent I lost health insurance which forced me to stop) or I could be hospitalized. Being faced with this makes me feel even crazier than I normally do. I am still functioning the best I can, I maintain hygiene and work full time. I’m trying really hard to not be an asshole to myself. I used to be very active and have hobbies, I would create art and be able to clean and do things so easily, but somehow in the past six months it’s become impossible to do anything besides what I require of myself. I am exhausted. I have my appointment to see about medication near the end of the month and I’m really really hoping that it goes well, and that my shitty insurance will at least cover the prescription. It doesn’t help that multiple generations of my family are mentally ill too but only believe it’s due to an absence of prayer. It feels very lonely. I’m 23 and I feel like I’ve lived my entire life already, I just want to be able to experience what life actually is instead of going about my weeks sticking to my rigid routines I’ve made like some kind of robot. There are a lot of other things that took place in my life as a teenager before the loss I suffered that definitely contribute to problems I have now, and I actually significantly cut this post down, but this is already a novel and I don’t want to subject anyone to more or break any rules here. Again it is my first time posting anything on here and I apologize if it’s a lot, but I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. Any advice on how you guys are able to calm yourself down in any way, and especially any motivating factors would be so, so appreciated. \n\nTL;DR OCD has become debilitating and need advice on how to maintain things while awaiting medication",

        "Text": "Some while ago I took 50mg Sertraline because of OCD. Not much, the recommended dose with OCD is 200mg as far as I know. However I noticed my OCD got worse instantly after taking it for 2 reasons: 1. I had constant racing thoughts, I felt like I had taken speed 2. I had less anxiety. Previously, I have learned that my compulsions are bad, so I got anxious about doing them which has saved my life a few times already regarding e.g. having money. But then, without anxiety, I had no fear of doing the compulsions anymore, it felt really, really strange. One of my favourite compulsion is buying things and returning them. So, what I did when I took Sertraline is buying dozens of things, as if I was manic, and returning so many things after realizing what I have done. So the compulsion only got amplified, not reduced.\n\nThis did not seem helpful. I have learned that anxiety is a valid emotion to feel, and when you not only feel anxious about not doing a compulsion, but also about \\*doing\\* a compulsion, to me, this is better than doing the compulsion because of a state of having no fear. I can see reasons for why Sertraline didn't work in my case. My OCD isn't fear based, it is under-stimulation based. So all Sertraline achieved was not feeling anxious about the consequences, but it didn't address the under-stimulation part. I can see Sertraline working when the OCD has its roots in anxiety, because it did work! Sertraline reduced my anxiety, I loved talking to people without anxiety, I had no social anxiety anymore! But the racing thoughts when I was alone, plus no fear of my compulsions anymore, which made the entire concept of \\*resisting\\* the obsessions futile, was enough for me having to stop taking Sertraline.\n\nDid anyone have any similar experience regarding SSRI and OCD where SSRI kind of made the compulsions worse, because you did not feel fear anymore regarding the consequences of your compulsions?",

We believe that his generalized anxiety and the angst of moving to a new school (and middle school) bubbled up into what can best be described as \"contamination\" avoidance.\n\nWe've been seeing a therapist and we have made progress but it seems we're plateauing.   There's no crises at school and he has found a way to make it through the day, but I know he's just creating habits and living/hiding it.\n\nThey set goals every week, but my son seems to forget or ignore them.  (He's ADHD, slightly on the spectrum, very smart, and very stubborn).\n\nFrom my perspective, the only time he seems to put forth any effort is if we're there to encourage him to fight, or show our disappointment when he doesn't.\n\nWhen he's challenged at school, he'll immediately give in and wash his hands or the article that is tainted or touched by others.   He'll get a wipe to wipe off his backpack, hair, paper, whatever.    When we talk about it, he apologizes and says \"I need to do better.  I will do better\".\n\nAnd then doesn't.   The next day is pretty much the same.  \"Good days\" happen when he's not challenged (i.e. nobody touches his stuff).  \"Bad days\" are when something happens and he gives in immediately.\n\nWe've tried \"just wait 5 minutes\" or \"only wash your hands between classes\" but he doesn't seem to do that.   Without us there, he immediately soothes.  We've tried starting small, but he \"forgets\" or finds another reason.   Even when talking about it afterwards, we can't get him to agree that he's being irrational and that there's nothing there to cause the issue.   \n\nThe only time I feel I've seen progress is when we have a meltdown at home over something and he gets forced into confronting the discomfort without relief until he calms down.    After that, he generally seems to be able to tolerate whatever was intolerable before.   \n\nI'm about to reach the end of my rope on supporting him per the therapist and doing what I've been told is unhelpful:  forcing the issue when I can control his environment and behavior.  I'm at the point where I'm going to create exposure sessions and not give a choice about response until he's able to calm himself down.\n\nTalk me out of, or into my plan.    Or provide another one.  Or provide your perspective.\n\nBecause otherwise, I'm about ready to give up and let him navigate it on his own and let him live with his choices.  I know that's a shit plan as a parent, but I'm just getting tired of burning money and watching him do nothing but set his future self up for failure.",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "Hello, \n\nIf anyone has any advice of words to offer, please have away at it. \n\nI'm not 100% sure if I have OCD, but a lot of my symptoms line up, and I've been diagnosed before with it, but I have also been diagnosed with other anxiety disorders too. What I find most is that I get stuck ruminating/looping/checking things/diving into internet searches/intrusive thoughts/fear... all that. I'm hoping people here can relate more than on another sub... \n\nI have an upcoming medical procedure. It's considered \"routine\" however this will be my first time doing it, as I have avoided it for many years because of discomfort for a variety of reasons. \n\nRight now, my mind is stuck on the procedure, and how there is a possibility of bad pain. This procedure has mixed reviews. Lots of people seem to get through it fine, no pain, only discomfort. But, lots of other online reviews have said it is horrible and excruciating, so it seems like it is a 50/50 chance of whether it will be agony or okay. And with those odds...I'm freaking out. I don't like those odds. I don't like gambling at all. I NEED to be prepared this, but I don't know how I can be. \n\nI've read all the stories, read all the articles, read the recommendations and do's and dont's, talked with the doctors, talked with a few people I know, talked with my therapist, and I still feel so fucking terrified... \n\nI know the anxiety will probably make the potential pain and potential for a worse outcome WAY more likely, but I sincerely do not know how to calm my mind right now. I'm in tears over this upcoming appointment every day leading up to it. It's torture. I hate waiting and uncertainty. What's even worse, is that after THIS exam, I MAY have to have another one which is considered WAY more painful and invasive...but I don't even know if I can get through the first step... \n\nMy symptoms and anxieties and everything have been flaring up SO badly in the weeks leading up to this appointment. I haven't had a flare up this bad in a few years...so I feel like I've forgotten how to control the despair and fears of uncertainty... \n\nBut the thing is...this isn't some scary thing that MIGHT or MIGHT NOT happen. This is a scary thing that IS DEFINITELY HAPPENING and is SCHEDULED already. I am going to it SOON and have to endure whatever happens unless I get up and walk out. Which I may do anyway. \n\nPlease if anyone has tips for how to get a grip on this, send any tips my way...dm if you want... I'm open to ideas. I'm struggling. I can barely work, eat, bathe... Every day at work I find myself losing hour after hour to endless researching things about this medical procedure... I just feel like I NEED to be prepared the best way I can... And I don't know how to do that other than reading people's experiences...and those experiences are not helping my anxiety at all... I don't know what to do. \n\nI really want this procedure done with so I can move on to have a surgery I need, but... I just don't know if I can do it. I'm so scared... I will be loading up on anti-anxiety pills before hand, but...even then... I just don't know. I'm so miserable right now. Every day is spent thinking and ruminating about this...over and over and over... and over... and over... \n\nI can see all the ways it would go terribly. However, I can also see some ways it would go decently. I'm just afraid of letting myself consider that good possibility because if it DOES go badly, I will be that much less prepared, having gotten my hopes up for better. I think if I prepare myself as much as possible for any potential pain, I will do better... But that also makes me more apprehensive and scared in other ways. \n\nI don't know. I feel like I'm relapsing into how I was a few years ago, when my mental health was very, very bad. I don't want to fall back to that state, but it feels like I'm on the verge of it happening...\n\nHow does anyone else manage their increasingly distressing symptoms when faced with an upcoming (likely) painful (also uncomfortable due to the nature of exam) medical procedure? \n\n  \nTLRD: Upcoming Dr. appointment. Chance of bad pain during it/also it will be uncomfortable in general as I have to be undressed. Anxiety at a high, not sure how to help. Ruminating daily all day every day, disrupting my life. How do you handle these symptoms with upcoming scary medical procedures? \n\nThanks... ",

My OCD causes me to overthink of \"the butterfly effect\". It tells how small thing could lead to a huge catastrophy. Here's an example of a Situation I have had: I accidentally misspelled a word. The word started wandering in my head. Because I was thinking about the word that I had ACCIDENTALLY misspelled/typoed, I fell on the ground since I wasn't paying enough attention to the road I was walking on. --> I got a wound on my skin. I knew I'd need to put a plaster on it, but I thought \"no, I can't put.\" because, --> If I hadn't accidentally misspelled the word ---> I wouldn't have been paying less attention to my surroundings ---> So I probably wouldn't have fallen, you got it. There'd also be other examples but I'mma not make this too long. And I guess this is a combination of overthinking and OCD and Magical thinking and ruminating, but doesn't have a more specific name. Interesting enough. But how could I cope with this type of overthinking? What do you guys think? Thank you in advance!

        "Text": "I am desperate, Ive been putting it off for so long because Ive been utterly hopeless. Its bittersweet as Ive made the most success cutting off addictions, mainly maladaptive daydreaming which was something I heavily struggled (im talking hours a day daydreaming) for most of my life, years spent in a fictional world. I finally fully managed to stop it and its been that way for months. I also managed to fully cut out doomscrolling and social media, I managed to stop eating nothing but sugary junk food. All without therapy and medication. So its not like I feel incapable, yet my anxiety is next to near impossible to fucking live with.\n\nIt is crippling and I dont know what to do. There is nothing that I can say to make it soubnd as severe as it feels. I have no friends, I live in isolation. I go to work, I come home. I might go to the gym if I push myself to. I sit in one spot and if Im not sitting in one spot Im pacing around, I sit in one spot because I cant move otherwise. I do things over and over and over again. I listen to the same music, eat the same food, the same youtube videos, the same everything. Again, I cannot put into words to tell you how bad it is. I feel like nothing I say is enough to relay how much hell this is for me. I take little enjoyment from it. I find other stuff I like to do but I never do it for whatever reason, the anxiety is too bad.\n\nI am not a depressed person. The irony is that all my life Ive been prescribed anti depressants, anti psychotics, and mood stabilizers all of which never worked- and all of which were times during my life I was facing extreme stress from external factors that despite knowing about they never tried to help with. Once I removed most of those stressors, I am a normal person with a stable mood and no depression. But my anxiety kills me. It causes depression, it causes all my problems. I want to die. Its never ending torment, me being hyperaware of literally everything- the worse being the existential dread that refuses to go away. Over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER again, the same shit. I try to make a goal where I would do one thing outside my comfort zone daily, something as small as listening to a new song or taking a walk, but its too overwhelming. All I do is sit here, sometimes im not even doing anything Im simply sitting here ruminating on things too paralyzed to move. It makes trying to go to work hell or do anything hell because when I move any part of my body the anxiety feels like Im being held at gun point.\n\nIm worried medication is too good to be true, Im worried that they wont even prescribe me medication for anxiety because for whatever fucking reason they never prescribed me it in the past as a minor even though they gave me an OCD diagnosis. They gave me an OCD diagnosis yet never treated me for it ort told me about it.\n\nI cant take it man. Ive broke down so many times because of it, at one point I had to go to Urgent Care while at work because it was so bad- only to find out the people at Urgent Care cant prescribe medication, and that I should go to the ER. I felt like crying at the time, I felt like screaming. I never went to the ER because simply being out there was too much for me and I couldnt imagine waiting there for potentially 3 hours. Whats worse is that a lot of my OCD, a lot of it I have no awareness thats its OCD-related until after the episode is over. It is horrible, I cant believe theres people out there that get cured of OCD entirely, Ive struggled with this all my life without help and it baffles me how much pain and suffering Ive been in since I was a little kid caught up in repetitive loops feeling helpless and destroyed with no one to care or try to help me and not knowing what was going on other than feeling broken. Years and experiences I lost out on due to abuse and trauma, sure, but mainly due to OCD because of how I reacted to it all.\n\nI need help so badly. I feel so fucking hopeless. I end up overeating on food and I feel out of control, all because I want to calm down. It makes me feel unfocused, unmotivated, everything. Its literally the cause of all my problems, then everything else is just the effect of it. ",

I'm in the UK so replies from others in the UK would be especially helpful. I'm just wondering how long it would really take for my therapist to look at all my symptoms and be able to tell me whether I have OCD (which I'm sure that I do at this point after how long I've been struggling and the symptoms I have daily).\n\nA diagnosis would really help me in terms of peace of mind and also being able to tell people that I have diagnosed OCD straight up, rather than 'I have OCD symptoms' which sadly in my experience has never been taken as seriously. \n\nThank you!!",

I’ve dealt with more common themes, such as scrupulosity, magical, thinking, touching door knobs to prevent a catastrophic event, etc. However, about 10 years ago, when I was listening to one of my favorite songs, I found it really interesting how music can seemingly transport you back into a particularly fond memory from when you were previously listening to that song. I.e. I listened to this track while I was lying in a hammock on vacation, now whenever I hear that song it feels like I’m back in that hammock. Then the thought occurred to me: what if this can happen with bad and/or disgusting memories? What if I listened to an album I was really looking forward to, but in the middle of a great song I saw or thought about something gross, and then forever more when I tried listening to that song, I would be reminded of said gross thing. Since then, this theme has exploded into endless scenarios, severely fucking up my life since I was a teenager. I deliberately avoid potentially impactful moments in my life because I’m terrified that somehow the memories of these moments can be forever tainted by any number of disturbing thoughts/images. I can go on forever. Main question is just if anyone has experienced this theme before? ",

It didn’t itch at all, which made it feel even stranger. We’ve had bats get into our house a couple of times in the past, and my sister recently mentioned seeing a lot of bats in the area.

I can’t shake the fear that this bite might be from a bat.\n\nFast forward to 5 weeks after the bite—I actually saw a bat in my room.

        "Text": "This is mostly just me rambling about how nobody understands how disgusting and freaky the world is, so if you're tired and need happy things please move on. I recommend poetry.\n\nI hate public places. Hate them. The more people, the worse it is. And there is one particular place for me that gives me the icks in a way no other place has managed to do. As in, every time I come back from there I immediately wash my hands with castile soap, several times, divest myself of any personal items that may be in pockets (carefully holding open said pocket with one hand while gingerly plucking out my phone and buds and wallet with the other), strip, and shower for an hour. Everything I use there gets sprayed with ethanol before use, and I spray my hands after, as well as the bottle because I touched it with my hands. Ew.\n\nSo. I got stuck with cleaning duty today. I can do anything EXCEPT cleaning. I cannot clean my workplace, I just can't. It's fifty years old and dusty and disgusting, people throw up all the time and it's just a mess. And this was an unused room without proper ventilation or a supervisor, so it was DISGUSTING. There were documents from 2016 in one desk! Eight years ago!\n\nAnyway, I had to clean with seven other people. Look, usually I'm all for tough love and forcing slackers to work. I'm usually the one pulling more weight than I should because, well, I obsess over the tiniest things. But I cannot, simply cannot touch decades-old brooms and dustpans. Or mops. God, those mops. Gives me the worst headache just thinking about it. You can probably tell where this is going. One person who shall not be named shoved a broom at me and told me I could choose between that and sponging the walls. I did sweep, but only with my right hand because I needed my left for carrying my things. I just - why? I know these people, they know me. I don't consider them friends by any means but they're people I have to see on a daily basis. They know I can't share uniform vests during team building exercises and work without. They know I use a gigantic carry file just so my papers don't have to touch surfaces. They know I sanitize everything and have panic attacks when I forget my spray bottles. And yet they laughed. Asked me if I was going to spritz the broom handle. (Why bother, I'd rather hold my hand away from me for thirty minutes, walk home, and scrub my hand for an hour. Those old sticks are beyond cleaning.) All I wanted was a little bit of understanding. Maybe delegate the annoying little tasks to me, like straightening and taking out wobbly desks. That's annoying, brutal, but at least I would be dealing with a lesser demon. Nope. Apparently I had to sweep. The dust...it's been three hours, I scrubbed every inch of my body, gargled five times, sanitised, and showered again. I still feel it in the back of my throat. I have a special kind of loathing for cleaning my 'ick' places, and this one takes the cake.\n\nIf you actually read all that, thank you and I'm sorry. Have a better day than I did, okay?",

        "Text": "I’ve been hesitant to talk about this for a while, thinking that sooner or later, I’d somehow get better, that I could overcome my OCD on my own, or maybe I’d feel better over time once my financial situation improved and I could afford things I enjoy. But it has only gotten worse. I should mention that there are two reasons I'm writing this: First, to listen to others who are going through similar experiences in communities like this and learn what they have done. Second, even if it’s not as effective as clinical treatment, I want to know if there’s anything others have done that has at least helped ease their situation somewhat. And yes, I know this isn’t the place to seek a definitive treatment.If I'M not wrong OCD is something that can’t exactly be “cured.” But right now, as a Turkish university student, I’m going through one of the hardest times of my life both psychologically and financially, and having OCD only makes this period more challenging. Ever since my parents divorced, my father has completely disappeared from my life, and financial support from him is the least of his concerns. I’m not mentioning these details to get sympathy. The main point I’m trying to convey is that even though I really want to see a therapist, I’m not entirely sure if I can afford it.\n\nMy obsession mostly revolves around perfectionism. And this didn’t just develop over a few years—it’s been growing over time, reaching a level I can’t tolerate anymore. I think it started back in middle school, where my drive and anxiety over getting high grades began. Now, it’s reached a point where the incident that made me first suspect I had OCD gave me such a terrible headache that it felt like my brain was going to explode, and it even messed up my stomach and intestines. In my final year of high school, I barely attended school for the first half of the term. Currently, my issue is not about grades. My problem is that whenever I make a mistake, I get stuck on it and can’t let go. Ironically, most of the time, these “mistakes” aren’t even my fault. And even when they are, it’s ridiculous that I let it bother me so much to the point of depressing myself. What I often consider “my mistakes” are generally related to getting spoiled about shows, movies, and games I love or having negative memories about them. No matter how much I tell myself that these things don’t matter, it’s not something I can solve just by saying it. I can’t get these moments out of my head. I end up getting stuck on something I should have already forgotten about. Every time the thought comes to mind, I clench my teeth in multiples of even numbers (especially 4 and 8). Or I hold my breath, close my eyes, and force myself to remember that moment over and over again. These actions are really just hurting myself, and I know it. I’m only wearing myself out. In my mind, I’m marking those memories on an imaginary calendar, and it feels like the days before those moments were heaven, while now I’m in the depths of hell. I find myself wishing hundreds of times that I could go back to the time before that moment.\n\nIf I were to compare this feeling to something, it’s like being a jockey leading an exciting race, only to suddenly fall off the horse due to a wrong move, or maybe tripping on something, or—even if I won the race—saying the wrong thing in the post-race interview and being humiliated. Even when I experience something I love exactly how I want, even the tiniest thing that could ruin that experience makes me feel this way. I feel like I’m defective, and I feel sad knowing I can’t go back and fix it. I start feeling intense headaches and deep depression because of myself and my compulsions. But one of the main reasons for this perfectionism and obsession is also me. I kept feeding it by continuing rituals like taking a shower and shaving before watching or reading something. Since September, when I get anxious because of this obsession, I’ve also started pulling out the hair on my hand and fingers with my teeth or tweezers. In short, my situation is terrible. At this rate, I’m going to be too afraid to even do my favorite hobbies.\n\nSorry for a text this long but I really had to completely explain my situation with giving the full context.If you have any advices that at least I can try it on my own you can share with [me.At](http://me.At) least I want to be in a little bit better situation until I can afford a therapist.",

I've been scrolling this subreddit for a while and have found out some good information and advice about OCD here. \n\nFor the past few months I have truly been struggling with intrusive thoughts and what I know understand to be rumination. When I first began struggling with my thoughts, I was so scared to tell anyone because I thought they reflected who I was. However, through my own research I have since learnt of what OCD is and have since booked an appointment for myself for psychiatry tomorrow to get an official diagnosis and begin treatment.\n\nHere in lies the problem- I'm really f-ing terrified about my appointment tomorrow. Whilst I have explained to those closest to me that I have begun to struggle with intrusive thoughts, I've never really explained them to anyone before given the occasionally graphic nature of my thoughts, fears of becoming an abuser and p*rv like my father. I'm really scared that tomorrow, I'll go in and be told I don't have OCD, that my Intrusive thoughts are wrong, and that I'm a bad person.\n\nI realise this is likely negative ruminating or something, however I've heard of bad experiences individuals with OCD have had with psychiatry/therapy and don't want to find myself in a similar situation. There aren't a lot of therapy options in the country I live, and of the few even fewer are affordable. \n\nThis is a longer post than I intended, but I'd really appreciate some advice on red and green flags in therapy, advice for things I should do, etc. ahead of my appointment tomorrow. Thank you so much 💗 \n\nJ",

Ive had a hard time processing and accepting this, thus interfering with my current relationship. \n\nI'm currently seeking professional psychological help. I think I've developed OCD the pure O kind which is triggered by my anxiety of messing things up in the relationship. \nConstantly sacred of finding other people attractive, cheating thoughts etc.\nMy compulsion is to confess, but since we broke up, this won't be happening as frequently anymore. \n\nIve had this itch for the past few months of seeing the area on google maps where one of my past hookups befor i met my boyfriend was.\n \nI don't think it's because i necessarily want to cheat, i was just curious what area of the city that was. I let my boyfriend know that i want to look it up, while we were still together at that time, but i felt bad so i just did it roughly an in the end i still didn't know. \n\nMost times when I open Google Maps I think about this thought of wanting to see what area that was. Like an itch.\n\nI think i just wanted to know out of curiosity if it was close to where i lived with my boyfriend... \nmaybe out of the risk of running into them. Or i don't know, i just wanted to know.\n\nthis past hookup was kind of a manipulative person, he looked good and the intimate relation was also good, fulfilling my fantasies, so maybe there is something in me that can't process as to why that person was so shitty to me, especially over text.. in person he was ok...\nI just feel like I hadn't digested it, but Im also quite sure that I won't start anything after my breakup with my boyfriend, who was great to me.\n\nOn the evening we broke up, we have been having a rough time the past few month due to me Compulsive confessing about my sexual thoughts and other messed up stuff. I am currently getting professional help.\n\nBut on that evening after the break up and some hours passed, and i was lookin at google maps for the location of my psychiatrist appointment and i felt like it was close to the place of my brief encounter with the man before I had met my boyfriend. So I looked at the subway map and picked out the station that i think i got out at at that time, not sure if it was 100% that, but i typed it into google maps and got a more detailed area of where that person was living.\n\nI felt like finally after months my itch had finally disappeared.\nOf course when i open google maps now i will be having a short thought about the area, but now i know where it was and i feel relieved?\n\nBut i feel like confessing me looking it up to my boyfriend. We just broke up yesterday, and i will see him again when i come to pick up my stuff. \n\nI don't think i did it under the intention to want to go to that place and hook up with this one-night guy. \nI was just curious. \nIve had this itch some during my relationship and now after.\n\nIt would be helpful if you guys could give me some insight...\ndid I maybe do it for closure? Or just curiosity? Or am I really just planning on going there and sleeping with him right away? (I don't think I am but my brain likes to flip things into the worst scenario about me)\nOr is this normal and am I just overthinking?\nBut maybe there is more to that, which i will discuss with my therapist.\n\nMy brain at the moment often flips my thoughts into something negative, it makes me doubt myself and my intentions so I'm overthinking now.\nAlso i have a fear of being manipulative.\n\nEspecially because i am scared of falling back into toxic situationships and hookups after my great relationship. It has happened before, after my previous relationship.\n\nI don't want to, but I am scared that I will, because that has been my comfort zone, probably due to my low self worth and lack of boundaries. \n\nBut i do want to change for real this time, I just doubt myself and am scared that I won't pull through.\n\nI just don't know if this is normal, that i looked that place up.\n\nI would love to get some input ot theories, while I wait out my next appointment with my therapist .\n",

My girlfriend has OCD, and she said she was insanely scared of hurting herself (to the point where she didn’t want to move) about a week before she was diagnosed, although she never actually hurt herself. This happened to her about just under two years ago, and my parents told me this about a week ago.\n\nFast forward to tonight, where I was calling her. She has mentioned many bad experiences she has had in the past, and has told me a lot more before tonight. I was thinking about it, and then it hit me. My life has been going way too well compared to many people I know (especially her). I feel like I’m just waiting for something bad to happen now. A “what if,” if you may. I’ve researched the condition a lot in the past when I learned she had it, and many people who have the condition have said they had a lot of bad “what ifs” before and after they were diagnosed. And then it gave me another “what if.” I thought there was no way in hell we both have OCD. What if I was just faking my depression? I know I certainly haven’t been, but part of me says I am.\n\nWe talked about this a little, and I’ve also went to the doctor to talk about my depression. I’ve never had an official diagnosis, but I think my parents are trying to find a therapist for me, and I believe that would be when I get one? But I don’t know.

        "Text": "I feel embarrassed to talk about this and I struggle to describe what I'm feeling properly. I've had OCD to checking my electronics mostly and some other things for a while now, it usually gets worse at random times, either in times of severe stress or boredom. I'm a bit worried and confused my OCD might be spreading or warping in some way, and I don't understand it. I feel like I have some strange bizarre type of OCD my friends don't even have and it makes me worried nobody will have advice for it :( I know its all the same brand of OCD just different for different people.\n\nI got into this habit of checking my computers \"computer\" folder, I became convinced if I didn't check it the folders would vanish or cease to exist or something similar even though I know that's not likely to actually happen. I used to do it once in a while, click on it and verify there was still the same number of folders and they hadn't vanished or became more. I didn't feel like it was a burden or annoying and it didn't hamper me at all. I would click it once, look and then go about my way, it took not even a full second.\n\nThen it progressed to me doing it once a day. The first click was to actually look and verify the folders, the second one was \"just cause\" for some reason I didn't understand. Maybe because I have OCD to uneven numbers and the idea I did it only once and not twice \"felt bad\". Now I'm clicking each of these four times a day and screenshotting them multiple times while I do it too.:(\n\nNow my issue currently is the \"just cause\" part of that. It started to hamper me. It started with just checking the computer folder, then I had to check my computers updates to check if any updates had been installed without my permission(it is set to update only when I click so). Then its progressed to checking my Cloud Storage on two accounts. Then it's progressed to checking my unlisted YouTube videos of deceased pets despite having them backed up on 9 separate USBS now. All of these things were annoying and hampering me seriously on their OWN but they didn't take more than 3 minutes of my day usually of just clicking and looking.\n\nBut now I've begun doing these entirely randomly it seems. I got over my worry about several of these: the Cloud storage, the pet videos and the updates for example. They stopped bothering me, which frequently happens with my OCD, it will get bored and go find something else.\n\nYet I'm still checking them, is my issue. I don't want too and I don't care to check them. But I've gotten into this strange thing, where I check them and I'm not even looking at them? I will click them, screenshot them and not even glance at it. I don't understand it on that part. It's like OCD without the OCD somehow? I'm not worried about the updates folder for example but I still click it every night. Multiple times.\n\nIt's gotten so bad I've spent three solid hours. Three actual hours doing this every day for two weeks now. And its worse: I've done this MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY every day now. Each time around three hours. It feels less like \"I wonder what I'm gonna do today\" and more like \"I wonder why I'm gonna have to go spend the next three hours clicking buttons I'm not even engaging with\".\n\nI can't seem to stop myself. I used to do these because I was really worried, but now I continue to do them with no worry. I've never heard of this weird type of OCD and I don't have any ideas on tips to try. I  know about exposure therapy and its not helping so much right now. My only theory is I used to do these things because I would feel safe once I verified things were fine, but none of it makes me feel safe anymore. I keep repeating these actions expecting to feel safe.\n\nit doesn't matter what it is, I feel if I repeat a repetitive hand motion or click on a certain button it will make me feel \"safe\" again. I don't even care what it it's about, I will click the button in some vain attempt I will feel safe. I don't even see what I click. This doesn't help me one random things either, I tried it :/ I'm not really sure what to do, I feel so miserable and trapped. It feels like every day I \"have\" to do this now. I used to be able to avoid something randomly triggering me at times but now there is no trigger its just always there, and my OCD seems to be looking for some ritual to do, but I'm not even invested in the ritual I just do it automatically. I feel ashamed and disgusted and embarrassed I do this.  \nI usually do it when I come in around 8:30 but then I'll start it again randomly around 9-10. Suddenly it's 12 and now it's 2:30 like it is here and I spent around 2hrs now doing this over and over again. This is my nights the last two weeks. Doing this and then going to bed. I even do it during the day now. I don't know what type of OCD it is where I don't even worry about the \"cause\" but keep doing the movements. I don't understand anymore.:( I feel sick.",

She was diagnosed this past May, but has been showing tendencies for a few years now. She is currently in therapy and sees a psychiatrist as well for medication. We have been doing our best to support her but it has been difficult on our family. \n\nThe advice I need is with one of her biggest challenges in an avoidance OCD and it’s with her brother. She can no longer be in the same room as him and whenever he walks by her room or even mentions her she’ll scream “stop it”. When we try to have a family dinner together she’ll sit at the same table as him for a few minutes but she won’t face him and she eats as quickly as possible to leave the table ASAP. She won’t even eat the same foods as him now, for instance if I buy the kids a bag of Doritos she won’t eat from the same bag if he’s the one who opened it. \n\nAs you can tell this is having a negative impact on our family and it has shown no signs of getting better.  My son is a sweet kid and has never done anything to hurt his sister, he understands that she’s not in control of her OCD thoughts, but I can tell it hurts his feelings. It’s difficult to be there for both of them and keep the peace in our home. Can anyone offer me some advice? I want to help my daughter and I want my family back together. \n\nTLDR: My daughter has a severe avoidance of her brother and it’s hurting our family. ",

        "Title": "An updated model of OCD treatment?",
        "Upvotes": 14,
        "Text": "Hey all! Dr. Sam Greenblatt here with another OCD article that folks might find useful!\n\n*If you or a loved one struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), you’ve likely heard of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). This treatment is known as the gold standard and has been shown through ample research to be a highly effective treatment (e.g. Song et al., 2022). What you may be unaware of, however, is that there has been an innovation in the application of ERP that may enhance its effectiveness. In this article we’ll compare this innovation, called the Inhibitory Learning Theory (ILT), to the older model of ERP, namely Emotion Processing Theory (EPT).*\n\n**Is Habituation Central to ERP?**\n\nInitially, ERP was thought to work through a process called habituation. Habituation is a process in which repeated exposure to a stimulus decreases a subject’s responses to that stimulus.. A model called the Emotion Processing Theory (EPT) claimed that habituation is the central component to ERP: that repeatedly exposing a patient to their fear, while preventing the client from escaping that fear, would gradually reduce the patient’s physiological responses to said fear (Foa & Kozak, 1986). However, much research since then has questioned whether habituation is actually central to successful outcomes in exposure therapy. Many researchers have found no relationship between habituation within a given session and treatment outcomes (Baker et al., 2010, Jaycox, Foa, & Morral, 1998; Kozak, Foa, & Steketee, 1988; Meuret, Seidel, Rosenfield, Hofmann, & Rosenfield, 2012). Researchers have also discovered that treatment results can be gained in the absence of habituation (e.g., Rachman, Craske, Tallman, & Solyom, 1986; Rowe & Craske, 1998b; Tsao & Craske, 2000).\n\n**Introducing Inhibitory Learning Theory (ILT)**\n\nThis leaves us with an important question. If habituation is not a central component of ERP, but ERP is still effective, what is *actually* causing the change? Inhibitory learning theory (ILT) offers a new and perhaps more accurate perspective on ERP. Rather than focusing solely on reducing anxiety during exposures, ILT emphasizes creating new learning experiences that override old fear-based associations. When a client has OCD, they often have expectations that facing their fear without protective measures such as reassurance or other compulsions will result in disaster: either literally or in the form of intolerable heightened anxiety. When we utilize an ILT approach, we challenge these expectations in a variety of ways, to help the client learn that they can handle their anxiety much better than they might have anticipated (Kim et al., 2020, Jacoby & Abramowitz, 2016).\n\n**What are the strengths of an ILT approach?**\n\nOne central issue with the EPT ERP is that patients often relapse (e.g., Franklin & Foa, 1998). Researchers have begun to propose that ILT ERP may be more effective in providing lasting results. For example, a study by Elsner et al. (2022) found that habituation (reduction in fear during exposure) predicted short-term improvement, but something called “expectancy violation” (a key component of ILT) was more predictive of long-term success after treatment. Similarly, Bautista and Teng (2022) argue that an ILT approach utilizes tools that can prevent relapse more effectively than the traditional habituation method. This may be because through an ILT model, clients learn a generalizable set of skills to handle anxiety which can help them even if their OCD switches themes. Conversely, habituating to one OCD theme may not help clients to the same extent later on if their OCD takes on a different theme.\n\nIt is important to note, as can be seen from a quick glance at the dates of the studies referenced here, that this research is still very new. However, in our clinic at OCD and Anxiety Specialists, we can attest to a bevy of anecdotal data. We frequently treat folks who report having had been to therapy before or even seen an OCD specialist before and did not receive the results they were looking for. Perhaps during therapy, the client struggled to habituate to their theme, and each exposure was as challenging and unhelpful as the one before it. Perhaps the client developed “meta-OCD” and began obsessing about the treatment itself, which interfered with treatment results. Perhaps in the moment they felt that therapy was “working,” or the therapy helped them achieve relief from their current OCD theme, but the results did not last over time. Perhaps the client did achieve enduring results for their specific OCD theme, but when the theme switched after therapy was over, the client had no idea how to manage it. In these situations and more, we have frequently found the ILT approach to be helpful where the EPT approach fell short.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether you are just learning about OCD or have been in treatment for a while, understanding these different approaches can provide valuable insight into your treatment. Both the habituation model and ILT offer powerful tools for treating anxiety and OCD, and knowing how they work can help you feel more confident and engaged in your treatment journey. We believe that there are many advantages to undergoing treatment based on a more modern and updated understanding of the processes of ERP.\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nAdams, T. G., Cisler, J.

Because of that I'll try not to describe anything too graphically.\n\nUgh, where should I start... Okay, well to start with just about everything related to using the toilet REALLY bothers me. I practically panic if I even suspect that I've come in contact with anything from going #1 or #2... Even a tiny spec of toilet paper on my pants the size of a pen tip seriously bothers me. It's gotten bad enough that I'll if something like I just described happens I'll literally freeze up and not move while both my heart and mind races till someone notices that I've been in the bathroom for 40mins or longer. If that wasn't enough, I have to make sure everything is clean as possible... I'll wipe down the toilets where I've before I'll even consider using the porcelain throne. To top things off I live with someone who's personal hygiene isn't the greatest by normal standards... So I'm extremely hesitant to touch basically anything that they handle regularly. The skin on my hands is constantly cracking from the frequent hand washing and exposure to cleaning chemicals... I honestly have no idea what to do.\n\nI know I'm not supposed to ask for medical advice and I'll refrain from doing that. I would though greatly appreciate any advice anyone might be able to give till I can afford to see a professional about this. I wasn't expecting mental health chat services to be so freaking expensive.",

        "Text": "\n\nHi everyone. I have been researching and exploring people's experiences for some time now. I have been diagnosed with OCD and been prscribed anti depressants (of which I no longer take), but even my doctor told me they hadn't heard a case like mine. I have tried to explore OCD communities on Reddit and social medi but I could not relate to anything. I have felt so alone. Until I came across some research and discussions about TOCD. It has completely changed my outlook on life knowing there are people going through the same things as me!\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share some compulsions/ tic / feelings I have felt since childhood, in the hopes that someone can relate and feel a little less alone.\n\n(I'm sorry if they are hard to understand, they can be so hard to describe)\n\n1. If I step on a snail, I have to say (out loud), \" sorry Mr snail, sorry Mrs. Snail, sorry Mrs snail, sorry Mr. Snail\". And then repeat this, but inverting it to start with Mrs, snail. This normally isn't enough so I will start again, but starting with Mrs. Snail and invering it like before. If this int enough, I normally have to repeat the whole process backwards and forward until I have created an equilibrium in my mind.\n\n\n2. If I look over my shoulder at something, I look over my other shoulder and try to match the feeling/ angle/ whatever that I did over the first shoulder. If that didn't feel right in one swift movement, I will repeat my actions backwards (starting with the second shoulder then returning to the first) HOWEVER it can be really bad and if my eye doesn't catch the same place/ thing I looked at the first time. I repeat until Ive done EXACTLY what I did/ saw the first time around.\n\n3. Moving my fingers over my phone/ laptop screen. Even the slightest movement can feel wrong. I will move my fingers over the screen (either toughing it or just in the air) until it feels right. I'm trying to perfectly retrace my steps. But I get so stressed and I can not breath when this takes place. It's actually happening as I type this.\n\nDo you find that your tics get very aggressive when you talk about them?\n\n4. I feel overwhelmed that I can not breath in enough OR that I can open my eyes wide enough. I will sit there breathing in as much as possible and trying to open my eyes further an further. And I get so much stress when this is not physically possible.\n\n5. Somtimes I get a flash of panic/ thought of death/ a bad memory and I will say abusive things to myself or just really weird things that I can't help saying and I keep repeating them until I feeling goes away\n\nThere are other things but I will leave it there for now.\n\nI do not feel like something specifically bad is going to happen when I can't complete my tasks or find the 'just right' feeling. I feel an immense sense of dread, stress, pain in my chest, a crushing/ suffocating feeling in my thought. Severely tense and unsettled.\n\nI hope this post wasn't completely dull, I just wanted to share some of my experiences and see if there's anyone who can relate.\n\nThere really needs to be more research into this condition. And we need to be heard and made to feel like we're not 'weird' for the way we feel and act!",

One minute she’s got it under control and the next minute she panics because I took out the garbage and didn’t immediately take a shower. \n\n\nAnyway, she and I have built a good life together. There’s very little we disagree with. However, I’m slowly realizing that I’ve been walking on eggshells around her the entire time we’ve been together. I didn’t notice it initially because I was happy to make little accommodations to help her feel comfortable. For instance, showering at night before bed instead of in the morning like I used too. A very tiny change in my own life that actually made sense. Other things that made slightly less sense were things like not touching the trashcan unless I planned on sanitizing my hands with rubbing alcohol or taking a shower afterwards. \n\nI made these accommodations because I was in love with her and it seemed like a fair enough trade. \n\n\nAlso just FYI she was able to minimize her OCD a lot when we first got together. It slowly got worse the following months after we were dating. \n\n\nNow, it’s gotten to the point where if I do one thing that her OCD hates, it’ll ruin the whole day for both of us. She gets upset at me because of OCD, and then I get upset because she’s upset. \n\n\nAnyway, we’ve tried talking about it many times and we’ve tried different things like me specifically not accommodating her. (Which doesn’t work because then she just ends up hating me). \n\n\nOn top of the OCD which is by far the biggest factor, there are other little things about her that have bothered me that I’ve always known but now I’m seriously thinking about it more. (Things like she’s a bit of a hoarder and has extreme procrastination on certain things). Those small things in and of themselves don’t make me consider ending the relationship. But the OCD causing so much emotion and stress plus all the other stuff plus the stress of recent politics have really brought the status of our relationship to the forefront of both of our minds. \n\nWe’ve talked about it of course we want to make it work. We love eachother a lot + we have 2 cats together. \n\n\n\nBut I am starting to have my doubts. Do you guys have any advice for me? \n\nFeel free to direct me to any other sub btw.

I also clock watch a lot and have found out that the two are linked. Before anyone gets on their high horse and tells me to ‘push past the compulsions’ or ‘challenge the behaviour’, I would like to point out that my brain is wired this way, it isn’t changing and it’s likely that I know my own limits when it comes to how far I can push myself. I take medication for my OCD and this means that I can pretty much live life as ‘normal’ but I still have evenings like this evening. \n\nI am currently staying in a hotel due to being away with work and I am finding it incredibly hard to settle. My OCD has decided to take the reins which is also making it extremely hard to get to sleep. Tonight the only way that I could get it to settle was by driving to the hospital carpark and sitting there and working. I realise this probably seems extremely strange but to fill in some gaps, I have had two really bad cases of pneumonia where I have been hospitalised and the routine and regimental side of hospitals now seem to calm me - odd right? \n\nSo I’m sat here wondering if anyone else lives in the same strange OCD bubble and if they have ever needed a ‘break’ so have gone to a ‘safe place’ or done a certain routine that may seem ridiculous to anyone else but that works for them?

I have always kinda felt like there is a little bit of something else going on, and have had psychiatrists tell me I seem like i have BPD and ADHD traits but never enough to be diagnosed/tested subclinical on those assessments. I know bipolar is very tricky and can come with a wide variety of symptoms so I have just been kinda lumping in these OCD symptoms with bipolar, but at this point they have started to seem a lot more distinct, and causing me issues with falling into obsessions and compulsions for like 4+ hours on end. I have a couple friends with OCD who have been in OCD bootcamps lately who have been a lot more open about their struggles with OCD and it has made me feel more comfortable talking to them about my struggles. They have all individually said that it seems to them like I have OCD, which has led me to research OCD a lot more and let me tell you, reading descriptions of moral scrupulosity plus your guys' descriptions of your experiences with  other OCD themes has made me feel seen in a way that I have never felt before and I find myself crying every time something resonates with me. There are so many things that I deal with that I cannot put into words with friends or with therapists that i have wound up keeping to myself that I have finally seen described by OCD, and I feel honestly less confused and worried than I used to. My current therapist is an ACSW who, bless her heart, doesn't know much about bipolar or OCD but it is all I can afford right now, but I am scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist soon to reevaluate getting back on bipolar meds and I will definitely be bringing up the likelihood of OCD.  Tagging this as a win because if I do end up having OCD, figuring this out is definitely a win\n\nTLDR: this subreddit has made me feel so seen, and i will be talking to a doctor about OCD because never have i before related to anything as much as i have related to your experiences with OCD",

I even started to write a list with all my OCD topics from the past few weeks.\n\nMy new fear is not being able to sleep because I am constantly thinking and hyperfocusing on my breathing. During the day I am doing okay, but as soon as I close my eyes, my mind starts to be hyperaware of my breathing which is making my sleep very very terrible :-( Like I am noticing every single breath that I am taking. I am just so exhausted and angry at this OCD, because why does it want someone to suffer so badly :-(?\n\nAnyway? Did someone go through breathing OCD (I think the medical Termin is somatic OCD) with having problems to sleep because of it? I really need help.\n\nThank you!\n\n",

        "Text": "Hey all, thanks for stopping by.  I have a very sweet and caring Fiance who I love dearly.  However, I've been through the wringer in more ways than one.\n\n1) I've suffered from relatively severe OCD since about 2005.\n\n2) Nine years ago I slipped and fell down stairs at work.  My TH11 vertibrae broke + was compressed leading to severe back pain.  Especially when lifting.\n\n3) In mid 2023 I had a brain surgery to remove a big aneurysm that couldn't be treated with a coiling.  This lead to a small stroke which resulted in epilepsy.  While we're not sure if the epilepsy will go away or not, I am on medication for it.\n\n  \nThe medication I'm on heightens my anxiety pretty severely.  Thanks to the higher anxiety my OCD flares up.  I was told today that when I have to stop in the middle of a store or somewhere to deal with it she tells me it's embarrassing.\n\nThen about 2-3 years ago her son fell (who is disabled), nothing serious.  It was in the parking lot and I have severe issues bending over and picking things up from the ground, much less a child at 90lbs or so.  So an older man came over and helped out.  She said this was so embarrassing because a \"man twice my age could bend over and help him (the son) up\".\n\nShe claims that she sees these issues and wants to help, which I believe.  But on the other hand she tells me she's just used to the \"man being able to be strong\" blah blah blah.  \n\nI'm not completely disabled, I get her wheelchair in and out of the car which weighs 20lbs numerous times a day at times.  I go through a storage unit and move heavy boxes from one side to another etc.  But because I'm unable to pick up her child from the ground and another had to help I'm suddenly weak.\n\nIt's making me depressed.  I feel like she has no faith in me what-so-ever.  And at times either knowingly or not she'll throw some jabs in there.  And when I get upset at it I'm either \"too sensitive\" or have anger issues.\n\nAt times I feel like just breaking the engagement off and saying screw it.  Rant over, now how should I deal with this? I am only human and I have pretty thick skin.  But it's different when the woman who you love does it.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "Text": "Hello everyone, I hope somebody ready my post and I will get help. I am a audhd patient with history of bad OCD thoughts. I am currently getting treatment for my autism and ADHD with elvanse. Since I am a child I never was \"normal\". I always struggled with OCD, very bad anxiety in social situations so that I even had a time where I was at home for for years. I didn't go to school or university or work. I only left my house with my mother because I trusted her. This was a little background information to my story.\n\nSo now with elvanse I am happier than I ever was. I was happy one time in my life when I was in a ery good school with very supportive teachers. It was a christian school so the teachers were teaching with a high Christian moral like for example they were very calm in classes. I had the best grades in my class and even graduated as the best in school. This period of time really made me happy and increased my selfesteeem.\n\nNow since I graduated and I am a student at a university I had multiple breakdowns. I feel so ashamed for myself because I couldn't stay the person I once have been. On the other side I can understand myself why I had breakdowns. I found a few very very good friends due to university and I am grateful for that but I just can't go to university because it doesn't feel like a safe environment for me. Sometimes I think that I shouldn't blame myself for this or even gaslight myself because if my body and my mental health feel like it is a dangerous place it is the truth or not? My social environment pressures me to go to university anyway they understand me but a few people put a really bad pressure on me. They say almost everyday that I have to go to classes and just leave me with a feeling of shame and blame. I don't go to the classes but I still try to learn everything by self studying. It works for me so in reality I think there is no problem since we don't officially need to be present in classes.\n\nHere comes my problem and main reason for this post. Due to my medication with elvanse I have very bad paranoia I think because it isn't diagnosed but it feels like it's paranoia. As soon as a start my medication for the day I have a spiral of thoughts in my head that I am a loser that I don't get anything done things like this. You think this is because it is true or is it because my environment put this thoughts in me?\n\nAnother thing is I was always scared of becoming crazy like getting schizophrenia or a psychosis. And I also don't know if this is because of my medication as a side effect or because a person of my family environment said very often to me that I behave like a person which has schizophrenia, because I have a very excessive dating life. This was even before my medication with elvanse. I do these things because I feel like it and I don't want to hurt anybody I just try to live my life since I also had very bad experience in serious relationship like facing abuse and physical vi*lance. I just try to be happy. And these experiences with those criticism and the paranoia I get from elvanse make me so anxious. I don't even know what to ask here in this post specifically I just need to get this off .my chest and asking for support from this community and maybe new perspectives on those situation. Please be respectful and nice 🙏🏽",

I’ve been using organic cacao powder instead of coffee and it’s way better for me. The main chemical is theobromine instead of caffeine. Longer lasting than caffeine but less stimulation. I usually have 1-1.5tsp in hot water and milk with 1-1.5tsp of monk fruit. It could take some time to kick in unlike coffee which is fast acting. Give it 1.5-2 hours minimum to kick in. Also, please note that cocoa and cacao are different. Cacao is more pure. Go organic if you try it. Don’t ever go 1 tbsp (full dose) at first because it could be too much! 1 tsp is a good place to start. I like taking it on an empty stomach in the morning mixed with water and milk. Or later in the day after waiting a while after eating. Also, I’m not a doctor so don’t take this as medical advice. I just wanted to share something I’ve been using instead of coffee or tea. ",

So I slowly crept back to social media to feel something.\n\n  \nI am an idiot. OCD thrives on your heightened sense of responsibility, guilt and anger. And what is 50% of social media content? Scrolling for 20 minutes everyday will expose you to hundreds of negativity around the world, demanding your empathy. And you with OCD will feel the need to empathize. So you empathize and empathize  more, ignoring the harm it is doing to your fragile mind. Your empathy is not normal. Your brain is demanding to \"fix\" things. You cannot detach yourself whenever you want to. And at some point you hit the empathy fatigue.\n\n  \nThis is not the right way to build resilience to OCD. I am not learning response prevention. Social media is not a controlled environment. It should be restrained legally.",

Its contamination based but I’m not worried about getting sick, I just think dirty. My showers take two hours of me religiously making sure I get everything, I can’t hug my parents, I can’t leave my room, I’ve gotta wash my hands after I touch anything outside of my room, the list goes on and on. But, tonight I just felt like I had enough. I feel like I’m throwing my life away. So, I shortened my shower to a few minutes, just did a scrub and rinse, got out, touched the doorknob and the light switch without washing my hands, then touched my bed and then other things in my room, dried off and got in bed with my phone which I’m typing on right now. It sounds so minuscule and silly when I think about it but it just filled me with so much fear. My skin feels like it’s crawling and I’m itchy because of how uncomfortable I made myself. But, I still think this was a huge step. I guess the next part is making it stick. Anyways, I just felt like sharing this",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, JUST SOMEONE WHO SUFFERED WITH OCD AND RECOVERED. \n\nWhat worked for me may not work for you, but I'm sharing this so hopefully I can help more people.\n\nAlso, english is my second language, so I apologize for any mistakes.\n\nFinally, mostly if not all of the things that are written here were already said my thousands of others, but I wanted to write here so that you know that I am a testimony that it worked.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Just look at the name of topics that are written below.\n\n\n\n\n\nHello. \n\n  \nSo, for how it started...\n\n  \nI always had OCD syntoms (even though I only discovered they were OCD later), but they were never that strong. Things like checking my bag excessively before going to school etc. In 2020, I was in my sophomore year of high school. As you might know, pandemic struck, and all of us had to stay at home. What we though would be some 2 weeks actually was way longer than that. We had online classes via Zoom Meetings, and that is when I noticed that something stronger was taking place.\n\nEvery time I woke up at morning to open Zoom, I had to be 100% sure that I did in fact click the right button. At first, I just payed more attention to be sure, then I had to open it 2, 3 and many more times just so I did not feel uneasy. This started to happen with other things such as being sure my microfone wasn't open or that my camera was off. And this started to happen with everything, using my pc, open the fridge and be sure I closed it, using the oven, and one the most famous ones, being sure I locked the door.\n\nAll of this was manageble, until one day, I was going up the stairs and counted the floors wrong. I skipped one. My eyes say that I had reached my floor but I didn't believe it. Even though I saw it, it didn't seem right. I felt that even if I got inside my house, in the \"real\" word I'd just be slamming my head into the neighbor's door. This is when it started to lose control\n\nIn the end of 2022, I went to a psychiatrist for the first time, and for some reason, he diagnosed me with Tourette Syndrome, which was not correct. Unsurprilsingly, the medications he gave to me did no effect. A month later, I went to a much better doctor, and that is when I started to get better. However, it was not easy. 2023 would be my hardest year to date. I couldn't stand up, turn to the side at bed, open a door, use my phone, since I just couldn't be sure of anything, life was really difficult. It only got better January of this year. Incredibly, things didn't seem to advance much until Oct of 23. But this is when my turning point happened. Here is what I've done.\n\n  \n1 - Correct medicine (Obviously): Currently I take 3 different medicine, morning, after lunch and at night. I had to change it many times to find the correct one, and for that you really need a psychiatrist. I don't know about other countries, but in mine you can't buy this medicine without a prescription. I would not recommend that, and I believe many other doctors would agree with me, because it could have very big collateral effects on you. That is why I'm not writing the name of what I take. Probably, medicine won't take care of it all alone, that is why I'm writing what else I've done/do.\n\n2 - Exercise: When I started treatment, I had difficulty to even move, but after some months of treatment, I was able to exercise a bit in my home. Just pushups and situps. Every day. It has an instant effect and a MUCH bigger one after some weeks/months of doing it. You have to give it time.\n\n3 - Food: Don't eat junk food, or anything industrialized. At least avoid it as much as you can. Trust me, eating healthy is one of the pillars to get better. Too much sugar in your body and you will feel anxious, increasing the effect of your OCD.\n\n4 - Reducing social media and quitting porn: You don't need to unninstall Instagram, Tiktok and else. I still use these, to keep up with friends and to know what is happening in the world, but you need to reduce the amount of time you use it for. As I grew up, I discovered that my parents were right when they said \"It's the phone's fault!\". Social media nowadays is one of the greatest inducers of anxiety in our and every generation. I have a tip for this one. Install an app called \"one ssec\" in your phone. It makes you wait for a bit every time you try to open social media. You can control which apps it works on and the length of the interventions. The point with this app is to reduce or stop those time where you open the apps automatically without even thinking, just beccause you are used to it. Quitting porn is one of the hardest things to do, and I still relapse here and then. The objective is to reduce it as much as possible. It is one of the largest possible releasers of dopamine in your brain and it kills your motivation to do anything. Reducing it will give you much more energy and will to beat your OCD.\n\n5 - Talking to people and healthy hobbies: Don't lock yourself in your room, you need to go hang out with your friends or other people. Do you have a language you want to learn? Enroll in classes for that language: you got yourself people and potentially new friends to talk to and a healthy hobby. This is just an example, and you can find many more if you think about your interests. Healthy hobbies include cooking, playing an instrument, leaning a new skill etc. Subtitute social media with these hobbies, and you will find that you'll enjoy a lot more of your time.\n\n6 - Don't rush yourself: Everyone has their time to recover. It could be a month, or maybe years. The point is that everytime you are doing one of these things you are a step closer to beating OCD. When I started treatment, I also felt like I'd never break free from it. But here I am. Sometimes I have urges, but I'm able to beat them. Just know that we are all here for you, and we'll all beat it one day.\n\nIf any of you have any questions, fell free to ask me anything you want in the comments and I'll try my best to answer and help you. I don't use reddit, but I checked this community once more than a year ago and I want to help as many people as I can to beat this, so here I am.",

I also see she's dealing with more beneath the surface that she isn't ready to share yet.\n\nI know part of it is she's afraid of becoming a narcissist like her father, because that's something I was (am?) afraid of, having a similar upbringing. When I brought it up to her, it was a realization she hadn't made yet.\n\nFrom what I've read it seems like some of the best ways to support is reading on it (which I've seen a few books but I'm not sure if any would touch on Scrupulosity/Moral), encourage therapy (ERP if I remember right), and not facilitate compulsions if possible (unless it's to the detriment of the person of course).\n\nShe does currently see a non-specialized behavioral therapist, I'm not sure if they've discussed ERP.\n\n**What I Need Advice On**\n\nThe part that I'm stuck on is I don't know how to give her support beyond \"I'm not upset with you. You are important to me.\" Etc etc. What books or reading I could seek out as someone who doesn't have OCD, but is trying to support someone who does. \n\nAny help is appreciated on this, thank you all in advance :)",

        "Text": "I was talking to a friend yesterday about reality because I experienced derealization. Instead of comforting me in saying that the world is real and everything is alright, she told me about her philosophical view on the world. I know that she tried to help in her own way because she’s a very analytical thinker and doesn’t sugarcoat anything. And it’s not like she told me everything isn’t real either - she actually said the opposite. She said „of course the world is real, what else would be?“\nI think what scares me so much is that sometimes I couldn’t understand her point. She always said „in your concept / in your reality there is an objective reality and there is right and wrong. In my concept / my philosophy and my reality there is no right or wrong. Everything one perceives is real.“ She then gave me an example where she said that if two people see a cat and the third doesn’t, that this doesn’t mean there is no cat - it means that two people in their reality see a cat and the third has one in their reality and all of those realities are equally real. She also said that she doesn’t believe in an objective reality and I gave her this example: If two people are talking then sure, each person interprets the conversation subjectively based on personal experience but that doesn’t mean there is no common ground. So let’s say it is raining and one person says „oh it’s raining“. Sure, both have their subjective reality to it: One person might like that it’s raining because they like the cold water on their skin. The other person might dislike that it’s raining. So both their perceptions on this are slightly different but that doesn’t change the objective reality on that it IS raining. My friend sort of agreed that humans most of the time perceive the same thing and that I don’t have to worry about perceiving reality wrong because she said most humans see 99% the same things. Still I wouldn’t understand why she would say there is no objective reality. I know that her opinion doesn’t necessarily mean it is true, but it still triggered me. I asked her if it is real that we have a conversation right now and she said „Sure if you perceive us having a conversation then it is real. There is no right and wrong.“ And I also asked her if she perceives us having a conversation and she said „Yes in my perception we also have a conversation.“. And then I asked her „but doesn’t that mean there is a shared objective reality?“ And she said that we are all connected and that in day to day life we are separated from one another and she said she doesn’t believe in common ground and an objective reality, still she said that „yes both of us perceive this conversation so humans are capable of perceiving the same circumstance.“. Her view on things confused me and when I asked her again she said that it is likely that we mean the same thing but articulate it differently. But now everytime I think about it I think „What if it’s not real? What if every person just lives in their reality and we all don’t share a reality?“. I know I‘m probably overreacting right now because it might be that she meant the same thing as me but just articulated it differently but I‘m experiencing heavy derealization right now and I think what triggers me more is that I don’t quite understand what exactly it is about this conversation that scared me and also that I don’t quite understand her view of the world. I am in extreme high alert right now, I have a headache and feel dizzy and tense and I panick but I can’t calm down. I also want to state that I do have psychiatric help.",

I feel guilty, and scared all the time. I‘m afraid I don‘t deserve to live, to recover. Afraid I‘m making the wrong choice. But for the first time in my life, i‘m making MY OWN choice. not one, out of fear, not one my OCD makes for me. mine. my choice. And for the first time in my life, i‘m chosing myself, over my fear, over my OCD which has made my life a living hell. I made a promise to myself, and I won‘t break it, no matter how scared and guilty I feel. \n\nI‘ve been spiraling again the past days. I‘m sad and angry at myself for allowing OCD to torture me again. For believing it‘s lies more than believing myself. But I know this is just another part of recovery journey, and I will fall again and again. And I will get up again everytime, whatever it takes. In the end, this is another opportunity to practise what I‘ve learned in OCD recovery. \n\nIf you‘re in the slumps aswell right now, i‘m going to write down some quotes that have helped me find hope in this journey. Letting go of something that is the only way you know (OCD) is hard, frightening, it feels wrong… But I know that letting go, letting yourself drift into the unknown and venturing further no matter how afraid, is the key to be free. \n\nMake a choice… allow yourself to make your own choice. Will you repeat what you‘ve been doing, or will you allow yourself to evolve into someone that choses your own happiness? Walk with me, will you? You will thank yourself one day, my friend. \n\n- Some quotes -\n\n„*If you‘re worried about the cost of going for it… you should see the price of staying exactly where you are.*“\n\n„*You cannot always be happy but you can always be brave. And that is the beginning of everything.*“\n\n„*Fear is a reaction. Courage is a choice*.“\n\n„*You don‘t have to be fearless. Doing it afraid is just as brave.*“\n\n„*I‘ve mastered the art of surviving. Now I want to live.*“\n\n„*A bird does not sing because it has an answer.

This is the first time something has been different in treatment in a long time with this diagnosis, so that's nice, but I'm pessimistic that things will ever actually get better. I live and breathe coping skills but the moments between having an intrusive thought and regulating myself are agonizing and it just wears me down until I have trouble coping with anything. \n\nI'm surprised it took this long to feel like I actually have an accurate diagnosis, but suddenly my life makes sense, which seems to be a relatively common experience here. I'm not sure what exactly I'm hoping for, but the cycle of coping until I breakdown and then getting back up again feels unsustainable and I don't know what to do about it.",

Fast forward to early 2024, things really started to spiral out of control. My mental health was 💩 to be exact. I reached a point where I would walk around my house with my eyes closed 24/7 bc everything triggered a specific something and I just didn’t want to deal with it as I felt too weak to even stop the compulsions. I would sit in the middle of my room hugging myself tightly. I dreaded even moving as I was too scared to even be in contact with anything. I would have auditory hallucinations which were scary. I once completely blacked out too. It was safe to say I was dead inside as life felt dull during the time. Eventually, I took matters into my own hands and found the courage to go to a therapist. I did and I was diagnosed with ocd and prescribed medication. One was to treat symptoms of ocd while the other was more for schizophrenic symptoms as I had mentioned to my therapist that I was having hallucinations and other symptoms.  Although my parents weren’t on board with it. I knew the only person that was responsible for me. Is me. While I don’t condone this. I finished the first pack of my medication but never went back to the therapist for a follow up as my therapist had instructed. I just felt okay and thought I could work with myself. Anyways, this is my experience with OCD. I hope this helps anyone. This is what I need everyone to know!\n\n1. It’s okay to go to a therapist despite what anyone thinks. At any age. At any time. Even if you’re not feeling low. Go and see a therapist. I always wished I went sooner maybe then my mental health wouldn’t have gone south. Don’t wait for 💩 to hit the fan to get things right. \n2. Medication for treating mental illness can sound very risky to some people. But you can speak with a medical professional to understand what you’re taking and why. I am a strong advocate for taking your meds even if people disagree. As long as you are responsible! \n3. Always follow up your session with another session. If your therapist says you have to come back. Then you probably do! \n4. Don’t stay quiet. Sometimes speaking can help you figure things out. You can dm me if you’re struggling. Remember, you are not alone ❤️\n\n",

I’ve also started wondering if I’ve actually had as many sexual experiences as I thought; there are only a couple that I know happened with absolute clarity, because I told my closest friend about them at the time and she’s confirmed all the details I’ve suspected. All the others… I have no idea. I just know before my partner, whether they were real or not, none of my sexual experiences were good and I don’t like trying to recall them. I prefer to imagine I was a virgin before meeting them even if it’s not true.\n\nI feel like I should tell my partner about this, but I’m not sure how much of it would actually be helpful, and how much of it is confession compulsion. I do know I feel extremely guilty for telling them “this happened” or “that happened” when I’ve now realised it probably didn’t. It feels like I’ve lied and that’s why I feel the need to tell them. For the last couple weeks I’ve been feeling the guilt of a mass murderer.\n\nBut along with feeling like a confession compulsion, it’ll also just sound really fucking weird to someone who doesn’t have OCD or any prior experience with it. I don’t think OCD causing false memories like this is a very well known phenomenon by non-OCD people at all and I dread the idea of trying to explain it to my partner. My therapist keeps reminding me that my partner doesn’t need to know every thing that’s ever happened to me or every thought I’ve ever had — just like I don’t need to know either about them because it’s irrelevant to me unless they WANT to share it — but idk. I feel like I have to tell them. (FYI they do know I have OCD but I’ve not really told them about this particular theme)\n\nShould I tell them or is it a compulsion I should ignore? And if I do tell them, how do I do it? ",

At first, it might be not easy as we tend to forget what OCD tells us as “nonsense” and believe it because of anxiety but practicing this will eventually program our brains to automatically label obsessions as worthless and such thoughts serve no purpose other than generate fear to perform compulsions. \n\nOCD requires training our brains we tend to forget important stuff and we tend to lose motivation so the only thing that is left is determination and discipline to always recognize and understand the thoughts you have and not perform compulsions if the root of such thoughts is OCD.",

I understand that tics are involuntary, while a compulsion can be thought about and stopped through cbt and erp techniques.  My problem is that most of my verbal responses have exhibited both of these.\n\nSometimes I am unaware of the subconscious anxiety-inducing thought until I “tic,” then do a little inventory of my stream of consciousness and backtrack to figure out what fleeting thought triggered it.  I have even had ig happen and not become aware until someone else points it out.  Other times, the same thought will be on the surface of my mind, and I am able to sit with the anxiety and control the verbal response, as though it were a compulsion I am working through.\n\nMany of these verbal responses are well-worn negative self-image or self-hatred statements from my teenage years and acted like a release valve for my anxiety.  Some times it comes on before I am able to consciously stop it, but in time to mitigate the negativity of the response partway through.\n\nMy confusion is how the same behavior can be involuntary in one circumstance (where I am not consciously aware I have had a mental stressor at all) but controllable when I am consciously aware of the intrusive thought.  Can the exact same verbalization be *both* a tic and a compulsion under different circumstances?",

I don't want to be a selfish person it not a deliberate act, but it's really difficult to see the world as it is,  and the people in it when I have so many things spinning around in my head. 3 weeks ago I found that a work colleague of mine was being tested for bowel cancer and I couldn't help but feel sorry for them and the stress it was causing them but I also had to worry if was also suffering from bowel cancer. Within a 15 minute window of finding out I managed to turn the whole thing into my problem. I certainly never thought of this mental illness in this way before and I now worry I've become a narcissist and an attention seeker this wasn't my intention, but after being told to open up and talk about my thoughts I feel I've gone to far and people are avoiding me incase I give them another reason to roll thier eyes and depress them. I do feel as if this illness does make me a selfish person only going to places I'm comfortable only talking about things I'm comfortable with expecting people to accept my wishes while I disregard there's because it's uncomfortable for me.

(E COLI!!!) so i came back home and washed my hands with HOT water for 60 seconds. i then washed my face with my hands and some of the water from my wet face went into my mouth. not to mention- i have been touching my phone. i didn’t disenfect it so the germs from the damn poop water are inevitable to have been near my lips now- and i licked my lips several times. i can’t sleep much, im super nervous and panicky. idk what to do….",

She's younger than me, but we connect over shared interests, like similar studies and favorite authors. For instance, we both appreciate Bukowski, though with mixed feelings because of his problematic behaviors. She mentioned that her ex had similar traits, which might be a sensitive area for her.\n\nWe’re both introverts, which makes me feel comfortable around her, but I’m concerned about one of our mutual friends (her other colleague), who seems to be uncomfortable with me lately. This friend, who has OCD, is aware of my past struggles with psychotic breaks, potential schizophrenia, and tendencies toward perfectionism and narcissism. I also flirted with her before I learnt she was engaged, so I immediately stopped, but I wonder if she might still feel uneasy around me because of that.\n\nI’m new to relationships and really want to handle this situation thoughtfully and in a way that avoids any unhealthy dynamics or codependency/abusive relationships. How can I approach things with this new girl, being mindful of my own OCD episodes, schizophrenia OCD and OCPD with and with the tension with our mutual friend?",

The reality is most people who suffer from OCD have an uncontrollable urge to do something or else their mind tells them something bad is going to happen if they don’t do it. People can’t easily recover from it and it takes really long time to work your way out of it. I want him to know this is no laughing matter and that if he were joking about in a public place a lot of people would be disgusted by that kind of behavior.

I know it doesn't make me a pedophile or a predator and that this is mental illness. These are just thoughts and not feelings, thoughts can't be wrong, nor can they be controlled.

When my obsessions gets really bad, it helps to remember how small my life is, even on a planetary scale, that I'm just one person out of literally billions. The things that matter to me and terrify me, and that I spend countless hours trying desperately to control and manage, will end with me when I die (or sooner, if I can fully recover) my memory will end when the people who knew me also die. And none of these things matter, I mean, not really, not any more than anything else that humans experience matters. This nihilistic outlook isn't comforting at all when I'm feeling ok, but in an OCD spiral its totally saved me. Whenever I think in these terms, I feel the anxiety inside me sputter and die and it's amazing. And then I can move on to secondary coping strategies (showing compassion for myself and others, radical acceptance, grounding)\n\nWhen I searched nihilism in this sub, though, some people have a theme for this : ( OCD really can latch onto anything, I'm so sorry for people with this theme! Cause when my comorbid depression gets bad, the nihilism is fucking terrible. And I imagine it's a bit like that.",

        "Text": "Hello everyone! I'm 17 years old and I've been suffering with ocd ever since I was around 13 or 14. Recently I've been implementing tactics into my life to overcome these thoughts.. previously I wouldn't have been able to post this out of fear of judgement or other unreasonable thoughts but since I've thought about ocd from a different perspective it feels almost as if I'm finally broken out of a vicious cycle and the chains are finally broken. Anyways although I'm not fully cured I wanted to share some things that could help you:) \n1. Ocd is not real. Look.. I know that ocd is a real condition, and it has neurological affects most definitely but I am more so focusing on the thoughts. I want you to close your eyes and think about this. Think about all of the time you have lived life before you started letting ocd into it, everything seemed amazing, so free, almost like there wasn't a care in the world emotionally when it came to intrusive thoughts and other things associated with ocd.. so what has changed?? Absolutely nothing. Your life is and still can be the same as before as long as you can remember back to those times and whenever thoughts come up just directly tell them \"you are not real. You cannot hurt me. You will not hurt me. You have came into my life to try and ruin it but I am stronger. I will not resist to these unreasonable thoughts as it has absolutely zero impact on my actual day to day life. \n\n2. Reading\nReading self help books, positivity books, or any kind of book that you enjoy reading can help calm you immensely. I was never much of a reader until a few months ago.. I had some birthday money and I thought instead of buying the usual stupid stuff that I like to buy that will give me temporary joy, why not just give it a go and buy a few books, I was surprised by how engaging it made me feel and overall how it improved my life. It can also strengthen your knowledge and mental strength making you naturally more resilient to ocd. I know it might sound kind of weird but it's important to atleast try it! Try to make sure it's books about complex or insightful topics though as Reading something like the diary of a wimpy kid will not really help lol. If anybody is at all curious what books I've been reading they are Atomic Habits by James Clear, and the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene, both of which are fantastic books and though aren't directly related to ocd implement thoughts and tactics that can change your perception on it. \n\n3. Simply pushing through\nOne of the problems I had was ignoring daily tasks such as cleaning, going out with friends, and other things as my ocd would take over and essentially make it very difficult to simply get up and do these things for example I worried that if I moved a box out of my room that something bad would happen.. but guess what it didn't surprise surprise haha. It felt that way for a few hours but you know what I did for those few hours? Went on a walk and listened to some music, then came home and took a nice long shower, by simply ignoring those thoughts.. no matter how hard it seems to be they will go away on their own and you can look back and see that it was false and be happy you decided to do so. Think of it like this, imagine you are attempting to lose weight and you see a cupcake, you want to resist and eat it but you know you will regret it later.. so you decide not to eat and and later on you feel happy about not giving in. The cupcake is your thoughts, and not giving into the temptation will greatly improve your life and overall well being. \n\nWell. That's about it. I have some more things but it would involve many more pages lol. So please let me know if this helps anyone at all. That's all have a blessed day everyone❤️",

I feel absolutely disgusting cause i don't have the energy to clean myself regularly. I want to rip my whole skin off my body and bleed to death that's how uncomfortable i am in my own body. I haven't been cleaning my room enought now i'm paranoid about bugs being everywhere. Everything is making me feel so fucking disgusting and uncomfortable but i just can't seem to change that. It takes too much effort. I have no one to talk to I guess nobody seems to care about my well being even tho I'm showing obvious signs of mental illness. My only way of venting and letting my thoughts out is reddit but for some fucking reason all my posts on r/suicidewatch, r/mentalhealth and r/depression are getting deleted. That's why I'm either here or on r/autism. So i'm sorry if this isn't really related to ocd",

And for the ones that were wearing stuff like tight pants/leggings/yoga pants that allowed me to see the outline of their body it felt like I wanted to die. Because of like 7 years straight of watching porn so many simple things like specific pants have become triggers.\n\nI saw a girl with her mother and her mother happened to have attractive features and of course the first thing my mind went to was “that’s where the kid gets it” and I was immediately furious at myself for even having that thought.\n\nYou see what I mean, it’s just relentless because it feels so real and it doesn’t help with the CONSTANT tingling in my genital area that won’t stop and sometimes even a bit of a erection (I think).\n\nI feel so dirty and disgusting and the hour long drive back was horrible since my girlfriend was sleeping and even with music I was alone with my thoughts. I tried to think back about what happened that day but it was only making it worse because it was feeling like I actually liked it (accompanied with more groinal responses).\n\nI genuinely feel like a monster right now and I was having several bad thoughts about hurting myself over the course of time. I don’t think I’d ever do that but I was just getting so depressed and upset at the whole thing. God this sucks. I barely am even convinced it’s OCD anymore and it genuinely feels like pedophilia.\n\nI can’t escape my mind. I can’t think like a normal person. I was literally feeling groinal stuff as I was crying, it’s ridiculous. Fuck whatever this is, you’ve succeeded at making me completely miserable.",

I got diagnosed with OCD around 3-4 years ago.\n\nI was able to kind of just live with it until I started suffering multiple panic attacks shortly after my 18th birthday. I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist ever since.\n\nI don't know what I want to do in life. I've been working at a fast food place for 3 years. Pay isn't great, but I don't feel particularly unhappy at the job. I don't love it, but I'm content. I understand that happiness is relative, so I do appreciate being content.\n\nI am currently doing a workforce development program, but I don't like it. I really dislike school, and have a hard time studying and getting work done. \n\nI plan on finishing the program, but I just feel sad. I feel sad because school used to be one of my strong suits. I graduated with good grades and a strong gpa, and ever since I left high school, things have gone down hill academically.\n\nI'm barely getting by in this program, and it just makes me sad that I probably will never be able to return to school and receive a bachelor's degree (already dropped out of college once). I feel insecure not having a degree, because I do believe that it is a sign of intelligence. I also get stressed because I realize that one of the few ways to have a somewhat decent life is having a college education or some type of trade, and both of those requires some degree of schooling.\n\nI'm happy at my little fast food job, and would be happy staying there. But I feel like I need to get a degree, and I'd be dumb not to, because the path I am taking will be much more difficult.\n\nI hope anyone who reads this understands, I'm sorry this has gone all over the place. Thank you.",

I grew up in a conservative, Christian home and dated an older guy (he was 15, i was 13) when i was younger. In hindsight, i felt extremely pressured and sexualized at a pretty young age. Once coming to high school and finding fellow queer folks, I quickly ended that relationship. \n\nMy first girlfriend was when I was 16 and I initially came out as bisexual. Since then, I’ve only had interest in dating women/non-male identifying people. Even now (at 24) I’m in a 4+ year relationship with my girlfriend who I’ve considered marrying. \n\nMy OCD this week has hit me with “What if your sexuality was all just an act of rebellion against your parents?” “What if you’ve been faking it this whole time?” “What if your parents were right and this was all just a phase?” etc. \n\nSO IRRITATING! Anyway, just wanted to vent. Like I said, no need for reassurance, but I would love some tips from folks who’ve had similar experiences/themes…or even just words of encouragement from people who’ve had a similar experience adjusting to medication & things just going kinda whack at first lol.

We had been together for 5 years and around 2 years in I began to have a lot of thoughts based around whether the relationship was right for me or not. This person had helped me through a lot of OCD spirals and I felt safe with them. Around year 3 my partner proposed to me which really spiked my OCD and indecision, it was a really tough time. But we remained together even though I said I wasn't ready to get married and I still had a lot of doubts but I couldn't tell if they were genuine reasons to break up or OCD. In the past year we moved countries to be closer to my family,  started new jobs, she decided to transition from male to female (which was hard but I wanted to support her through it). Two weeks ago she admitted to me that when we were traveling separately 9 months ago she cheated on me with 2 prostitutes then made up a story about being drugged and assaulted to get me to come fly to the country she was in and support her. I felt like my trust was completely betrayed and I cannot continue the relationship. She has relapsed into alcoholism and quit her job. I feel so awful and she keeps begging me to try to work through it but I don't feel like I can and OCD causing me to look back on all of our interactions the past few months and see all of the good things she is done for me causing me to question my decision and beat myself up. Any tips for how to get through this and discern real thoughts from OCD thoughts. If you read all that thank you! \n\nTLDR: many relationship problems, my partner cheated and lied to me and my OCD triggers me to be in a constant state of indecision and blaming myself. Need help.

        "Text": "(Quick warning: Some descriptions of habits might be unpleasant. Do not read if you are extremely sensitive.)\n\n\n\n\nI have several habits that I find extremely embarrassing to talk about with people who don't have OCD. One is that I have been damaging my teeth by grinding them against each other, and no matter how many solutions I try to use, it never works. My teeth have become chipped, loose, and painful. I'm even doing it right now, it seems like I'm doing this every minute and it hurts, but I cannot stop. I have mouth guards to wear but I end up just forcing them out and continuing the grinding of two teeth, leaving me to constantly hear the snapping of them against each other and feeling ashamed. Another thing is the need to lick or taste non-edible materials. I almost always have to taste the soap used to wash my hands. I am constantly doing this with earwax, dirt, soap, and other things like sanitizer. I do not consume these in large amounts, but I feel ashamed to be doing this. I want these things to end but there really is no way to stop the involuntary urges. I just need some support, because I haven't mentioned these issues to many people in the world outside of online communication.",

Since I reached the age of reason—around 8 or 9, or whenever that typically happens—I’ve felt compelled to tell my parents about every little thing I thought I might have done wrong or considered bad. Earlier this year, something happened (I’d rather not go into it), and it triggered a sort of “memory audit” of my past actions. At my worst, I just literately unraveled. I’ve been on many different medications; some have helped, while others haven’t. I’m 21 now and just so tired. Looking back, these thoughts have always been there, like a “dark passenger,” to quote from the show *Dexter*. They usually come up when I’m supposed to be having a good time or when I’ve just finished something stressful. Does my history suggest OCD? I've been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist but I really can't believe that this could happen in a year. ",

This isn't some trivial thing. You're so brave for putting up with what most others couldn't imagine the extent of suffering of.\n\nMental illness is just as much of a form of suffering as is physical. As someone also having depression (likely bipolar), autism + ADHD, and huge anxiety in general I'm pretty damn proud I fought through it all. I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian (cult) household which exacerbated and denied the OCD for most of my life and that just made it so much worse. I'm sure you all have your own environmental factors that make things so much harder. \n\nMeds and therapy have worked, and thankfully I know a medication that personally works very well for me that I'm getting on with this next flare up (Abilify). It's never hopeless with this disorder and just know simply you having dealt with it for so long means you're already an extremely resilient person and that your tolerance of this suffering will allow you to excel in your pursuits elsewhere. Use the brain keen to spend energy on ruminating to instead spend it on your values when it's possible. Of course, I completely understand if you're in too much distress at the moment, but I like to set myself up with activities to avoid the idle rumination time when things calm down to prepare for the future.\n\nAgain, I love you all for having such an immense spirit of endurance. Even those of you with those types of OCD who make you think you're a \"horrible\" person (trust me, you'll get past that too with treatment, as someone who landed in the hospital because of real event OCD and thought it was over). \n\nMy head hurts ATM lol so I could probably benefit from a cold shower and some exercise. Wishing you all peace and happiness which no matter what you may be thinking right now, will be yours in due time ❤️💜💖\n\n",

Except now, whenever I try to feel something positive about the loved one it targets, I get a horrible feeling. Literally all the time.

I try to accept the thoughts and feel better accepting them feeling like I’m going to do them, than fighting against them and I’m scared I will. It desperately feels like a desire. Hearing words, thinking any thing about anything remotely close, being with my loved one…it all feels like I want this. And am just stopping myself. What the hell do I do? Do I just give up?

He would tell me every thought he had. It could be nothing of consequence and then something horrible. Or it could be about me- my flaws, doubts as to whether he loves me. \nYears later, and after 6 months of therapy, he claims it’s much better. But it’s not. He struggles interacting with any other woman even marginally attractive. \n\nAnd there’s something different between us. I can kind of put my finger on it- but he’s generally very awkward unless we are talking about a topic that is completely separate from anything romance related or personal. There’s no sweetness without awkward or it ending quickly. And that’s rarely. There’s no confidence in his love towards me or desire for me. He still shows desire for me- but it’s almost always unserious. He’s very childlike in his interactions. Always making up a voice for speaking about intimacy, making jokes, etc. And I know I’m attractive and desirable and I know he loves me. I just don’t understand why he can’t be “real” if that makes sense. \nIf I’m wanting to be romantic or talk about us or even talking about general relationships, attraction, etc.. something changes in his demeanor towards me. \n\nI guess my question is- is this how it’s going to be forever? Can more therapy help? He says it can’t help and gets very angry when I bring it up. I’m trying so hard to be understanding but I don’t understand at all what the problem is. ",

I cant escape the feeling that \"all my hard work following compulsions was for nothing\" now, but even with that thought, I cant see how the compulsions were useless - instead it just makes me angry that something unexpected would ruin the sense of safety id painstakingly  built up with them. i hope it can at least act ad  some sort of ... involuntary exposure therapy, and not just a scary event that makes things worse, but i dont know how I would accomplish that. Does anyone have any words of support or tips on how to make it through this without going back to square 1 again?",

        "Text": "Tonight my ocd seriously about sent me to a mental hospital. For weeks now it’s just been back and fourth with depression, intense almost flashback type of thoughts, constantly in an anxious/scared state and I’m coming to the end of my rope here. I’ve been struggling with this bullshit for 4 YEARS now and I’m just now at the point of trying medication. I’ve held off for so long thinking I could handle it without medication since I’ve had a few periods where the thoughts didn’t bother me and I could easily identify them as ocd and move on with my life. This time it’s completely different. About a month or two ago I got triggered by something I saw on YouTube which was about my biggest ocd fear which is developing schizophrenia or going into psychosis. That’s always been my biggest fear ever since I had a bad experience with weed years ago and for some reason I have it so ingrained into my head that I won’t be able to live if I end up developing one of those illnesses. I struggled badly and was having panic attacks again almost daily after I saw that YouTube video but eventually I got past it and my ocd moved to something else. About a month ago now I had a really weird couple of days where my body just wouldn’t sleep no matter how tired I was or what I tried . I ended up checking into a mental clinic to get checked out and after what i told them about my sleeping problem and what not they just recommended me to a psychiatrist and tried giving me tips on what to do if I’m having a panic attack (like I don’t already know) . This was partially my fault because I’m terrified of telling someone about my real ocd issues in fear they won’t understand and either lock me up or misdiagnose me since ocd is still really misunderstood by a lot of “professionals” I just signed up for a therapy session with nocd so im planning on getting real help soon btw . But there’s something else I’m fearing aswell, my ocd has seemed to latch onto the idea that I may actually be bipolar and it’s pretty much convinced me that I am. Ever since those couple days of not sleeping I’m constantly worried I was in a manic episode and since I’ve waited so long to get help I’m heading towards a really bad road. I have lots of mood swings throughout the day but I feel it’s mainly depression related from my constant ocd thoughts. Basically one min I’m afraid of being bipolar and losing control, then when I get over that I’m worried about developing schiz or psychosis, then when I move on from that it’s something else and it’s just a never ending cycle. I’ve read and watched just about every video that’s out there about ocd and how to try and sit with the uncertainty and uncomfortable feelings but everytime I do my thoughts start racing and telling me it’s not ocd and that I’m doing more damage by not doing anything about it then going to get help. Eventually I spiral and freak out until I can calm myself down. I also seem to really struggle with the idea that ppl are going to think I’m insane so I never talk to anyone about these issues. That’s also why I’ve been hesitant on therapy for so long in fear ppl will judge me or misunderstand what I’m going though and just label me psychotic. I really really really need some advice because my therapy session isn’t for another few days and idk how I’m gonna make it till then. I’ve even been having a lot more suicidal thoughts recently (I’ve never hurt myself or ever thought about planning it out) but the depression this is causing almost seems like I won’t be able to take it anymore and flip out . Any advice would help because I’m severely struggling here this is worse than I’ve ever had it in my 4 years of dealing with this shit. ",

I told him about how I get certain parts of songs stuck in my head for days, how I need to do things like step on cracks on the sidewalk multiple times until it feels \"right\" or I get anxiety and a overall feeling of guilt/discomfort. It's not just with cracks on the sidewalk, it's with anything and I don't know until it happens. Sometimes I lay awake at night with songs in my head that won't let me sleep or reliving every past mistake I've made in my life. If I'm singing a song on the radio I get anxiety if someone interrupts me before I get to sing the whole song, the incomplete feeling makes me upset. I'm not saying I have OCD but it hurts to be dismissed and told that these things are normal because I would really hope that not everyone has to deal with this. If you have any advice or any idea of what I may be going through, please let me know. Thanks in advance.",

Change in location, a move or change in anything makes me think it a set up to my death. Like basically I think because we moved into a different house this house isn’t close to my personality so therefore it is more fit for my family which means I am going to die soon and this will be their home without me. \n\nOR my daughters room isn’t suiting her the way I see it should, so that means she will die and one of her brothers will probably have her room since my two boys share a room now 🤦‍♀️\n\nHere’s another one, we just started going to church and now that we all feel connected I believe that the church has been put into our lives because it’ll be easier access to one of our funerals, specifically mine and that the church will somehow surround themselves in support to my family when I’m gone because we became members of the congregation and they like us. \n\nMy OCD feels so complex and exhausting I have other things I do, rituals in the day to possibly limit these things from happening. Drastic changes would be moving into a different home (can’t do that) or literally stop going to church, I’m at that rate now where I would do that if I could. This is debilitating. I stopped Zoloft 6 months ago. I’m waiting on seeing a psychiatrist, it’s taking forever, I’m on a waitlist at the moment. I feel like time is running out. I hate this so much. \n\nCan anyone relate?

She's my favourite doll so it bothers me more than the rest. \n\nToday I kept taking photos to check if the blush chipped off. It's frustrating.

I'm just really curious what y'all think/if anyone has felt the same way of being somewhat a sexual person - having OCD for years but - afterwards have an odd relationship with sex \n\nBackstory:\nI remember as a kid liking sexual/sensual stuff that made me feel aroused. Around 8 or 9 I started developing OCD tendencies and by 14 or 15 I became trapped by OCD, particularly, sexually intrusive thoughts. I grew up in the south and viewed sex low-key as a thing only \"bad teenagers\" did but around 16 I started thinking I wanted to have sex. Due to my intrusive thoughts I was older than most people when I had my first kiss -> having sex because I was sooooo scared a thought would pop up when I did anything at all sexual with a person. It became less about desire and feeling like I just needed to catch-up with my peers. Once I was having sex, it was something to do to have a decent body count to, once again, fit in with what I thought my peers were doing. Sex was/is alright...but I am a woman with female anatomy and it takes me a while to finish by clitorial stimulation so maybe that's why I'm not crazy about it unlike the people with penisis who (in my experience) are in heaven as soon as their penises are slightly played with...but also the intrusive thoughts that happened during sex did not help me experience pleasure. ANYWAYS, it felt like a thing I did low-key just to have something to talk about with my friends. I'm now in my late 20s and haven't had severe OCD for three (3) years now thanks to ERP. I don't have intrusive thoughts when I have sex anymore...but I don't care for sex.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone else has had OCD who are okay with their thoughts now but still don't have a positive relationship with sex. Maybe I am asexual (fraysexual in particular because I feel like my attraction does fade but maybe that's all relationships??) or I have a low libido or OCD has made me have such bad association with sex that I no longer like it. Like I still get in my head but with random thoughts instead of an OCD cycle. I feel like it's so hard for me to connect my brain and my body without having some form of anxiety. I do weirdly like to feel aroused and sensual but passed that I'm lost. \n\nThanks!!",

        "Text": "So I have recently had this thought, I'm not sure how to ask this right but I'm going to try . So compulsions are supposed to bring relief right? What does it mean if it doesn't and you feel you need to ask or do something else immediately after? Like your brain just can't be sure and believe it, but there's no relief (at least I think) . I also have a second question about this , is it possible a compulsion can be seemingly trying to prove your fear correct for example like if I think I'm a bad person and I want to figure it out and look for things that verify that? Another example is rocd stuff and looking for things that can tell you if your partner is unfaithful or is meant to be with someone else and means you aren't meant to be together. Maybe I'm confused but I just read compulsions are usually like trying to alliviate anxiety and cause relief so why are mine opposite?",

I'm living with Mild Autism with ADHD and here are my things about me that I want to share:\n\n* I want things to be perfect and organized too, even though I’m also messy—especially when I’m writing. When I write something, it has to be on the line, otherwise, I start to feel uncomfortable. Whenever someone messes with my book, I get really frustrated, and I also get frustrated whenever someone types a proper noun in lowercase.\n* I started having intrusive thoughts when I was 11. At first, I thought I was crazy or something. Even when I told my parents, they were scared of me, and I felt like a person who might potentially hurt someone. I realized this last March, and I felt a bit less worse. To this day, I still have intrusive thoughts about someone hurting me and the worst are the ones based on things I've done in the past. (Real Event OCD)\n* I don't care about germs.\n* I'm afraid that someone might one day expose me for past actions I no longer engage in but have felt guilty about for so long. Worse than being exposed would be facing legal consequences. I feel like I'm not even a human.\n* Sometimes, I have intrusive thoughts about others driven by my insecurities, and it feels awful. I’m not even sure if these are still just intrusive thoughts at this point.\n* I'm an overthinker to the max. I’ve had an all-or-nothing mindset for a long time, and I often experience meltdowns, which are incredibly embarrassing\n\nI’m not even sure if this is OCD. It feels like it might not be, and that I’m just using it as an excuse for my difficult past. You’re definitely not alone in this situation; I used to think I was alone, not knowing anything about OCD. I thought it only meant being obsessed with cleaning. I’m glad I realized I’m not alone in this. While I can’t say for certain if this is OCD, I can definitely relate to many people with OCD.",

But I had a derealisation episode earlier this week and this time the feeling won’t go away. I’ve felt this weird feeling that everything seems blurry and dream-like for the past 5 days non-stop and I‘m terrified I’m going to feel this way forever now. I can’t stop thinking about it and googling it (it’s replaced the existential theme it seems) and I’ve seen so many things online that say people have had to deal with this for many years and I’m literally the most frightened I’ve ever been in my entire life. Most people also seem to have got it from alcohol or drugs or trauma and I’m scared because I haven‘t so I don’t know why I’m feeling this way. So basically, I just need to know… can anxiety such as that caused by OCD bring this on too? And will trying not to ruminate on it make it go away?\n\nAgain, I’m sorry for posting this, I know it’s probably not helpful for me, but I feel like if I understand why I’m feeling this way I can move towards being more comfortable with dealing with it.",

I thought nothing of it. I tried to shut my eyes since my music wasn’t working and my thoughts started drifting to my girlfriend and a sexual thought of us popped up and I got like halfway aroused by the thought,but remembered I was on the bus and thought of something else, but before I did a thought popped up encouraged me to keep thinking of the thought of me and my gf In said sexual act. After it I felt so ashamed of why I thought I something like that in public and I literally grabbed my bag and scooted all the way to the bus window and buried my face in my bag till I reached my stop. I know it was a thought about my gf but I can’t stop beating myself up about it cause I’m some way I feel I’m a monster. Especially because of the second thought urging me to keep it honking of the scenario on my head. \n\nTLDR : thought about my gf sexually in public and now I feel like a pedo. ",

Been there done that .\n\nI have severe ocd and just started lamotrigine (100mg). It has kind of helped me with my ocd by lessening the misophonia and groinal responses I have developed around my sister (had a delusion about her that developed in my teens that caused it. I don't believe it anymore but the misophonia and groinal response remain.) I have another theme where I feel the need to define every word I hear , read, use, etc ; and that has improved a lot. \n\nIt has all kind of gotten worse these past few days which is super disheartening because I thought I was on the road to recovery. I was wondering if anyone's ocd has gotten dramatically better on this medicine, and what dose they're on.\n\nI'm being honest, I'm experiencing a lot of mental pain right now because this is not the only disorder or issue I have. I am trying to stay strong , so please give me any advice you can. My ocd issue around my sister makes me feel like a monster and I really need to get rid of it for my sake but also for the sake of our relationship because I love and care for her immensely. Thank you , and if you are in any distress I am really sorry and hope things get better. ",

I went through a break up, lost my previous friend group as a result, moved out from my parents house to a new city for university, made a lot of new friends and (like this wasn't already enough) started to question my sexuality.

ACTUALLY I'm very happy right now, I managed to leave a toxic relationship and my life really changed for the better. I love it here! But somehow I'm stuck with this specific pattern, where I constantly and obsessively check in with my emotions and thoughts. I always question how i'm feeling at the moment. The thing is I know how OCD works, I know that the constant questioning influences my mood and disconnects me from the presence moment. However the last few weeks I just can't stop the thinking about the thinking about the thinking. It makes me so sad to ruin beatiful moments, just because I keep repeating \"you feel weird right know, don't you?\" in my head. Right now I'm at that point, where I start to experience derealization and depersonalisation again. Last time I felt this way, was 2-3 years ago. Probably I'm just struggling to process all the change that is going on in my life rn. Any tips to calm my overwhelmed mind? I just want to enjoy again!

I just am hoping for some reassurance or anything ...ANYTHING that came make me feel better to be honest, that I'm working myself up over potentially nothing and am assuming the worst.\n\nBack in September I was (happy) anxious over something, my appetite waxed and waned a bit, but I still ate (pretty) normally. I noticed one day at work that my pants felt a little looser, my belt also felt a little to. This started a snowball effect of panic for me for the last month and a half. I went home, and weighed myself, I was 147. My normal was somewhere around 149-151. My waist was 31\", which is around normal. All of my normally tight pants were easier to put on, so I know something changed right? For the next week or two, I just kept an eye on all of that, weight, waist, and clothing fit. Always fell somewhere between 147-149 and waist was always 30.75\" - 31.5\". Then I noticed at work that my belly button was soft and ill-formed. It wasn't taught or defined looking, it was soft and squishy, I also noticed below my navel, my lower abdomen was like...flat, and I could suck it into my body, so then I really freaked out. My stomach in general was more jiggly and malleable and not taught and distended like it usually is, for example, I could put on a tight pair of pants that the act of cinching the pants made my navel squish. I have rolls around my waist where my ribs are that I could pull on and poke when I sat crouched, and my breasts felt floppier. Then the next day I noticed the skin under my breasts felt crepey, or loose, like they've been deflated, and my nipples felt floppy and not hard, but it was all only even evident when lying flat. Then its just been one thing after another, my nose feels softer and smaller, like the head of my nose is shrinking, feel like my earlobes are dropping, the corners of my mouth are looser,  my shoulders feel bonier, my butt seems like it may becoming softer? I look pale, My skin is EXCEPTIONALLY soft right now, I mean everywhere, it is like BABY soft. And my skin everywhere feels like, loose from my skeleton or like more plump/saggy(?), my nails feel thinner, my hair seems thinner, my hairs pluck out easier.\n\nAgain, my weight is still 147ish, waist pretty much the same, I have had diarrhea off and on, my appetite also is off and on, and is highly dependant on how nervous I am and time of day (for example, I wake up anxious, food is a struggle, feel confident towards dinner and starving, gobble 4 slices of pizza). I FORCE MYSELF TO get to 1200 calories a day so the appetite thing shouldn't matter fyi.  \n\nMy BF, who sees me every day says I'm losing my damn mind and he's felt and looked at EVERYTHING I'm worried about and always says \"it feels like it's always felt' or \"it feels normal\" or \"you're hyperfocusing on things that were always there that you never paid attention to before\". I took photos of my face, same angle, place, lighting as a photo from 4 months ago and my face looks pretty much exactly the same, lips, nose, folds, shadows, etc...but every part of my body FEELS different, and I know for a damn fact my stomach is flatter and weirder.\n\nI've pretty much had to budge on going to a doctor now (even though I have white coat syndrome) cause I've never been this paranoid and concerned about pretty much any disease in my life, and I am someone who was diagnosed when I was 17 with a hypochondriac disorder. That being said, all because I am a hypochondriac doesn't mean I am impervious to disease, and that's what keeps my up at night. \n\nI'm worried about Cachexia, << this is like my kryptonite rn, I'm deathly afraid that my body is wasting away and I have undiagnosed cancer. Cachexia is often the FIRST sign you have cancer, and is associated with terminality. It's progressive muscle and fat wasting WITH OR WITHOUT WEIGHT LOSS, and regardless of eating, causes appetite loss, loose skin, body changes, skin changes, nail brittleness, etc. \n\n\nAgain, I have a scheduled appt, I'm freaking out tho in the meantime. After reading this, and what I am worried this is, does it seem like I'm dying? Is there any reason to think this is NOT cachexia? Any reassurances? ",

The only thing that seems to work until you build a tolerance is a high dose of opioids or benzodiazepines so you just don't care about anything that much. But that puts you on a fast track to running your life so I don't recommend.\n\nIn your experience, what medication substantially reduces or eliminates OCD symptoms? ",

        "Text": "I've been having pedophilic thoughts for just over a month now. I'm starting to doubt whether it's even OCD anymore :( \n\nThis may be a little TMI, but I have never \"fantizised\" about children like I have with adults. I also don't plan on it. But the thoughts I get tell me I really want to do something to loads of poor children, or that I'll lose control and molest one. Doesn't matter what they look like. From 0-17, if its a minor, my brain is going to do something unpleasant and make me feel like I want to sexually assault it. I hate it I hate it I hate it. It feels so real. I don't like this at all. I wish it would go away. \n\nLike, when I kind of \"forget\" that I'm getting intrusive thoughts, I can look at kids normally, be around them etc (except I might find them kind of annoying because I'm not a big fan of kids anyway). But then I remember 'Hey kids are making you anxious' then BOOM. Intrusive thought. This happened last night. From 1pm-2am I was fine!! Then I was on Instagram reels at night, saw a child, got an intrusive thought about performing a sex act and have been ruminating on it since. I hate it. Why is my brain telling me I like this. I don't want to. I've been around kids before. DIDN'T FEEL A GODDAMN THING. LITERALLY DIDN'T EVEN FEEL COMFORTABLE HELPING ONE GO TO THE BATHROOM. Literally right as I'm writing this I got an intrusive thought about how I should have gone in the bathroom with her because I would have liked it. WHY. SHUT THE FUCK UP.\n\nPart of me is feeling like 'Of course it's OCD. You never thought like this before your anxiety was triggered' but I'm scared I've had a sudden revelation or something and I actually do like kids. I'm also looking at the past and wondering if I've been attracted to children in the past (I'm 20, and I've only been attracted to people my age or older but I'm doubting that now for some reason). \n\nThis might initially sound homophobic but I promise it isn't. I'm scared that I am a pedophile and it's similar to how a lot of gay people think. Like, if you come from a homophobic family they might think 'I don't want to be gay. I hate this.'. I'm getting this but with pedophilia. I don't want to be a pedophile. I'm literally in love with 2 male celebrities twice my age. I feel like I'm going crazy and if I am actually a pedophile I'm going to kill myself. This just feels so real and I don't like it. I'm continuously gaslighting myself, saying that I do like it and that this is what I want BUT IT'S NOT. I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL. \n\nEven as I reread this I'm telling myself this sounds too much like a pedophile disorder than OCD. I want to cry so bad",

        "Text": "I'm diagnosed with autism, ADHD and anxiety. I have some issues I suspect might be OCD. They might also not be OCD, but I feel like I'm having trouble even having this conversation with anyone. It's an even bigger problem for my autistic sister, who I will elaborate on later. \n\nLately I have been blinking excessively in response to feeling anxious I'm not paying attention. So it can happen when I'm doing something like playing video games, which just makes me do worse. I spoke to my therapist who said it was autistic stimming. I really don't think that's correct. I know what stimming feels like, it feels soothing. This feels the opposite of soothing. Also, unlike stimming, I can attach it to a very specific anxiety and thought pattern. \n\nI also have obsessive rumination about past instances where I was mistreated or abused. It's a serious problem that interferes with my life and my friends, no matter how compassionate and patient they may be, are tired of hearing the same thing over and over. When I raised concerns about OCD, my therapist said it was an \"insult to my trauma.\" Of course she may be correct and it's trauma and not OCD, but I don't see why she can't at least take it seriously. I spoke to my neuropsychologist briefly who didn't take it seriously either, but I could try mentioning it again. I have a couple of friends who believe I might have OCD and one of them is diagnosed with both OCD and autism. \n\nMy sister has autism and this has been an even bigger issue for her. She's not entirely independent and to make a long story short I have a kind of unclear and unofficial caregiver role over her which I'm not entirely happy about. To be completely frank I want her to get treated in part because her obsessions interfere with my life. She has an obsessive fear of contamination and excessive worry about doing things \"correctly.\" For instance if a glass object breaks she has persistent worries about broken glass being in objects for days after, even after thorough cleaning and inspection. My parents claim she is not in emotional distress and merely \"does not understand\" which is an interpretation I strongly disagree with. During her most recent neuropsych I spoke to the evaluator who did not take my concerns seriously enough to test her for OCD. After the evaluation was done I wrote a long email listing incidents where she behaved like someone with OCD, and she admitted I have valid cause for concern but said she can't test her for it and referred me to an independent OCD clinic who also rejected her as a client.\n\nAnother frustration I have is the general internet conversation about \"intrusive thoughts.\" It seems impossible to have a rational conversation about telling apart an intrusive thought from unpleasant urges. Like if someone says they want to punch someone in the face people will respond \"that's an intrusive thought, it's normal, everyone has it\" except that's not true because sometimes people genuinely just feel a desire to punch someone in the face. \n\nSo in summary here are the issues I want feedback on.\n\n* I want to be able to tell apart autistic rumination and anxiety from OCD obsessive thinking and nobody has been able to help me, and I'm not sure what to do.\n\n* Even if I do not have OCD I want to figure out what this fucking blinking thing is and how to stop it. Isn't it possible I could have an OCD symptom without having full blown OCD? Or maybe it's tourettes or something I have no idea. I do NOT believe it is autistic stimming. \n\n* If anyone has advice on how to get myself and/or my sister a high quality official evaluation for OCD I would appreciate it. \n\n* If anyone has any resources that are intelligent and in depth about the subject of intrusive thoughts versus non-intrusive thoughts I would be interested.",

I want to help him because my parents are not willing to help him emotionally as it takes a lot of their energy for which I understand but I know my brother needs support from somewhere. He is so ashamed he cannot talk about it with anyone outside of immediate family, so any advice is greatly appreciated. Ever since he was little up until now (he is 16) I have noticed a lot of behavior linking to OCD but to not make this post so lengthy I will only include behavior from the last few months. Recently he came to my parents and me and told us he has been having a lot of intrusive thoughts that make him extremely uncomfortable and question his own morals or identity, I had to tell him what intrusive thoughts were and how I have them too so I can somewhat understand what he is going through. His thoughts consist of very awful things, the worst you can think about like incest,bestiality,pedophilic things, etc. He says it makes him feel dirty and he constantly washes his hands up to his elbow to the point where his skin is very irritated with rough patches and red skin, he also uses an abnormal amount of soap or bodywash in the shower and uses very hot water. He is afraid of contaminating anything he touches when he has these intrusive thoughts, he told me he is afraid that he might be attracted to his cousin because he follows a woman on instagram who looks kind of similar to her, he is also afraid he is a pedophile because of the intrusive thoughts he gets when he sees a child. I have tried to reassure him the most I can, telling him he is not a bad person because he knows he is NOT attracted to children and he does NOT want to date his cousin, he says his brain is messing with him and convincing him that he is the worst person ever for thinking these things even though he knows he is not a pedophile or into incest. He is restless and extremely stressed for the majority of the day and night because these thoughts dont leave him alone and he fixates on them, I don't know what I can offer him because he refuses to look for help online even anonymously, he has ADHD but my parents decided not to medicate him because he had a heart murmur that has healed up when he was little and they were afraid it would be harmful. I am 18 years old and do not have the money nor can I convince my parents to get him medication or therapy because he also does not like those things. Be honest and let me know what should be done, I don't want him to feel alone.\n\nEdit: He also VERYYY often asks for reassurance, and he doesnt seem to stop for hours sometimes. It's like he never actually feels reassured I feel like he eventually stops because he feels guilty for asking and not because he feels better.",

My OCD is too extreme I couldn't even imagine being in indirect contact with them so I vacuumed them as good as I could and sanitised myself afterwards. But this morning, there were at least 15 of them on the ceiling. My mother left her food to rot in the shelf and she didn't even tell me she left a bag of food open, without any protection. Though, I tell her all the time she can't do that because it makes me spiral and today, she made my worst fear happen. We literally had an invasion of these worms in the shelves in which we keep most of our food. They were crawling everywhere and I made her clean the whole thing. Told her to sanitise everything and throw away everything that was prone to having worms in it. I led me to be unable to walk in the kitchen or in the living room and now, I don't even know how I'll even manage to step in these rooms. Everything just feels to unsafe and contaminated without any solution to solve this. I don't know what to do. I'm so angry at my mother. I'm done with her never being careful. In what world is it even okay to do that and have a whole invasion of worms in FOOD WE CONSUME??? I'm done. I want to die. I just can't cope with this. Everything is spoiled and ruined forever now. Sorry if it doesnt make any sense but it's the worst I've even felt. I'm sure I swallowed a worm accidentally since she was so uncareful and I don't see how I'll ever be clean again after that. She ruined everything. She ruined my life.",

I wanted to make this post to invite people who feel hopeless or like they have spiralled too far down to ever be able to be the same, to talk to me.\n\nI have been dealing with OCD, mainly POCD, as well as a other similar branches of OCD for around three years now, and I have seen it all. Whatever you may be holding inside, which is breaking you down day by day, I am here to talk about it, and hopefully give you some sense of relief and logic to help you see it from a fresh set of eyes. Remember, your brain is at war with you, and it is targeting your weak points.\n\nJust to briefly summarise my situation; when it originally started, I did not even know I had OCD, and was naturally petrified. After about 1.5 years I finally got help, and for the past year I have been working towards recovery, but it is a difficult path with MANY dips, often reaching new extents to my OCD which I had never even dealt with before therapy, Anyways, I know first hand what to do, and what NOT to do, including what therapists will often recommend you. I think I am more than qualified to know what works and what doesn't.\n\nAnyways, this is just an invitation to DM me if you feel hopeless or alone. I know you have heard it before, but you are a victim - not the bad guy. When therapists first started telling me that, I hated to hear that. I thought: \"How can you possibly call someone with these thoughts the victim, and even worse, how can you feel sorry and sympathy towards me?\" I hated it beyond words, but now I am getting to a point where I am usually able to convince myself that that is the case.\n\nWell, that's all. DMs are open if you think it could benefit you. One of the best tools to recovery is to be involved in the community, and hear it from people who understand your struggles.",

I got better with medications for my mood swings. Prior to the right diagnosis I'd been only labeled as OCD with depression when in fact I have OCD with Bipolar disorder.\n\nThe road to where I am right now was tough because some people whom I shared my thoughts with knowing my weakness would exploit it if possible because of competition or some other insecurities of theirs. There's bound to be conflicts and people who would exploit ones they see as weaker. The only solution I have is to not take it personally and become stronger. The point I'm making is I am stronger than those triggers because self-awareness.\n\nI let my emotions take a passenger seat and my logic and mind the driver. A monk whom I respect once told me, \"Thoughts are combinations of good and bad. You just have to throw away those that harms you like taking out fishbones when you eat fish.\" Simple as that train your mind to disrupt the old habits.\n\nThoughts we have that causes OCD, rumination and patterns of behaviors to cope those compulsions are a norm to others. Someone else without OCD will be able to discard it as some unimportant thought. You can overcome it like them when your way of thinking is rewired or you have more control over your mind.\n\nThe key is self-awareness people do this differently for me I like to read, write and meditate (I force myself to cause it helps). Others might enjoy drawing, running or other sports. Those moments where you're alone with your thoughts while doing something to keep focus on you can gradually be in control of some part and not let your OCD rule all the time. This helps me a lot having Pure O-OCD where my compulsions are thoughts to counter the OCDs.\n\nNowadays my OCD is no longer a big part of life. Although I still have it I would say I'm able to discard it faster than I used to. As for people disrupting my peace I try to see it as normal part of life because everyone goes through it and sometimes it's not a problem with me but rather the provoker's own problems.\n\nThis ability to let go more easily I would credit it to both Buddhism and Stoicism because they teach me to focus on the important things in life and let go of the rest. Also not to take things personally and be aware of the importance of a peaceful mind, spending time wisely and some sense of direction in life.\n\nI hope by sharing my story it would inspire you and give you the strength to overcome your battles.",

I think I just wanted some kind of excuse for why I was so horrible, so I could tell myself that it wasn’t really me thinking these things, I could just blame it on my OCD. I did extensive research on OCD, I’m scared I might have placeboed myself into having symptoms because I wanted it to be true so badly. I needed it to be true, because if it wasn’t, then I was just a disgusting, vile human being. \n\nIt’s been just about a year since I was diagnosed, I was at a CBT appointment today, and my therapist wanted to work on separating me from my OCD. I just broke down. I am so selfish, stealing this spot from someone who actually needs it just so I can make myself feel better about being a monster. Because the truth is, there is no me separate from the OCD, it’s all just me, I am the monster. I’ve convinced myself and all the people around me that the explanation for all my weird thoughts and behaviours wasn’t my fault, but it is. I’ve just been too scared and ashamed to admit it this whole time. \n\nI don’t know what to do, and I think maybe I should just stop taking my meds because they’re just encouraging my sick game. ",

My mom is arguing that not being able to step on the rug without cleaning it first is a sign of my OCD worsening, while I’m arguing that it’s normal for someone to want to clean the rug first even ignoring the fact that I do have OCD. I have trouble with these situations because I realize that the OCD may be warping my perspective but at the same time I think that’s a normal boundary to have without bringing OCD into it.",

A year ago I stopped the bleach i'm not sure how but I guess the fumes/smell & my hands were really bad its great I did but the dishwasher tablet is still with me. Something about the granules make me feel like its scrubbing dirt off. Now I go through so many pods a day its out of hand. I thought of trying sea salt and thought that wont do anything. Randomly as I had the thought of how much i'm poisoning myself as I clean certain things with bleach and gives me headache. I checked whats in dishwasher tablets it seemed ok but I kept thinking I could literally get cancer from all of this. The headaches and dizziness. I thought of maybe using salt for the granules, to feel like it cleans. I know that would burn my skin. I thought of 'nail brush' but I would need so many new ones a day can't use the same ones. I'm wondering if I should just use a dish sponge which I sometimes do, the green scourer part to wash my hands. I would need like so many sponges a day but I don't mind that. I really don't know...

I am in recovery from an eating disorder and a lot of her ideas are just reminiscent of eating disorder treatment, just do the exposure and sit in discomfort and you'll be fine.

We have her home now the past 5 days and to say my OCD has kicked in horribly would be an understatement. \n\nI am constantly overthinking and catastrophizing the worst possible things that can happen. She has reflux so is not sleeping well at all and sounds under pressure when she is down in her cot. The hospital were happy tor discharge her but I can't help thinking she is not ok. For example I have spent the last two nights wide awake from 1am to about 8am just watching her in her cot to make sure everything is ok. I won't be able to keep running on very little sleep so I will have to try correct this. I also have other first time father concerns like feeding and winding her but I'm trying to get on with that. I really want to do as much as I can and not leave it all to my partner but I did go missing today doing other work around the house to avoid doing anything with the baby. It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I'm actually terrified. My partner is great and she is so understanding but I really want to make it easier for her by pulling my weight and getting stuck in. \n\nA history of bad OCD and now severe lack of sleep is creating a perfect storm of overthinking and crazy levels of anxiety. As I said my main concern is when she is down in the cot and breathing. It's crazy the dark places your brain will go when it's the middle of the night and you're just watching a child you love so much try to sleep. Not easy to admit this but I've been very upset a few times since she has come home due to worrying so much. \n\nI need to try calm down about it, was even considering contacting my doctor to try get Xanax, etc but then again I don't want to be taking anything while trying to stay sharp and awake watching my child. \n\nI appreciate any help or advice for anyone who has gone through this? From fathers or mother's.",

I always told myself that I was never gonna take medication but im at a breaking point. My good friend who is in medical school advised me to go to HIMS to get an evaluation. I did it and they prescribed me the generic version of lexapro(escitalopram) and I wanna know if anyone has taken it and what is your experience. Im really hoping it helps, the first shipment is arriving next week and im nervous/excited to try it. I just really wanna live my life to the fullest without the constant rumination the whole day.",

That’s fine by me i am only worried about any permanent effects on cognition from clonazepam at 0.25mg daily for 20 days because after 20 days it’s a follow up so he may change it after than. I do get intrusive thoughts and they are mostly sexual in nature nothing crazy . I often get social anxiety because I think people can hear my thoughts.

I started to literally shake, cry, have dark fantasies and wouldn't sleep and asking A LOT of questions to my mother about her general health, medical historial. Tonight I feel slightly better than last night but only because I tried to overcome my compulsion, which wasn't giving me the answers my mind wants. Since then I got no peace of mind. I'm still feeling anxious and cry silently alone sometimes. My mother has the medical tests till NEXT month. I'm desperate.

I did not see or realize that it hurts my quality of life the way it does. And it took me a week or two to really understand and see it in my life.\n\nMy main fixation at the moment is Sleep. I have PTSD, and I have been struggling with nightmares for over a decade. This past year, I have also developed nasty allergies that worsen at night for no known reason. Even though I’m getting both treated and the treatments are improving those issues, I have become absolutely terrified of sleeping.\n\nEven if I’m really tired, I subconsciously do everything I can to stay awake. I tell myself it’s not that late, find productive things to do (suddenly remember I have to do something urgent tomorrow and feel the need to do it tonight, etc.), doom scroll, look at the clock, feel guilty and doom scroll some more. I am almost always tired but I can’t seem to move past this and go to sleep.\n\nI’ve already developed a sleep disorder from this. I go to bed very VERY late, and get up very late too, sometimes way past 8 hours and into the 12 hours sphere. I still wake up horribly exhausted and am not productive into way further in the day than I’d like.\n\nI’m scared and I want to sleep peacefully again. I used to have the skill to fall asleep within 5 min, and now it can take me an hour or so. I’m a grad student that is stupid busy, and this is not sustainable for me. I’m also scared all the time. It’s exhausting.\n\nTLDR: I am afraid of sleeping and compulse. Please help me find a way to relax before bed and go to sleep.\n\n",

        "Text": "(Age 25 female) I have OCD and this is my current situation.  My fear of wasting money has developed over the past few years. It takes over my life and it's on my mind 24/7. I've realized how much pointless money I was spending in my life on little things that added up to never having any money. So now I don't spend any unless I can justify that it's worth it. I am happy to spend a lot of money on something worth it, but every time I spend money and it feels like a waste I do everything I can try to get my money back. I return things to grocery stores multiple times a week after considering if what I bought was worth it. I spent 6 hours in a clothing store the other day to make sure everything I bought I wouldn't regret. For my friends wedding I kept the tag on the dress so I could return it the next day. I cannot fathom spending money on something that'll just sit around. I don't want any gifts from anyone unless I'll definitely use it because the thought of anyone spending unnecessary money makes me feel sick. When my mom and husband spend money I give them endless reasons of how we already have something etc..I have a methodical list in my head of everything we all own (my mom lives with me and my husband) and whenever either of them want to buy something unnecessary it makes my head spin. My husband makes $22 an hour and whenever he spends that much on something unnecessary I always remind him if it's worth an hour's worth of hard labor work. The other night he wanted a glass of wine at a very fancy place it was $18 for glass. I looked up the bottle and it said it's $20 for the same exact bottle when it was listed as $95 for the bottle at the restaurant. I would have been happy with him getting a glass of expensive wine if it was worth it, but the moment I found out how much of a scam it would have been I convinced him otherwise. \nWhenever I buy anything that I can no longer return and it isn't really worth it I think about it every single day until I can think of how to make it worth it. For example my husband came home with paper cups. I tore into him about how we have a million perfectly good cups and that we didn't need to spend $6 on paper cups. He said that it was too late to return it since he already used one. So I now am trying to think of as many ways to get the money worth. Making a designated cup to give my cats water,  plant watering cup, mouth wash cup, paint water cup, etc... If I cannot justify a purchase it eats me alive and I grieve the precious money that could have contributed to something we truly need in the future. I feel anxiety every day thinking about how much money I have lost in my life. A huge thing I massively regret is how much I have tipped in my life. If I calculated every tip I have given out it would actually make my head spin. So I have stopped tipping entirely. I always write a note saying I don't have enough to tip. I only tip if service is so extraordinary that it's like a little thank you. I used to tip people in fear that If I didn't they'd spit in my drink, but now my fear is that I'm giving a tip only when I can justify it in the same way as justifying all of my purchases. I wasn't always like this, and I miss not calculating every transaction my household makes.  I miss not crying because I cannot make decisions in grocery stores trying to figure out what is worth the value for health and satisfaction and not over paying. I miss getting unnecessary snacks and actually enjoying them. Now snacks just taste like a gluttonous waste of calories and money. ",

        "Text": "ONLY 18+ ⚠️\nNO MINORS.\nHello everyone, so I am 18M and as most people do, especially at this age, I am always in the mood to masturbate or have sex. I use to be someone to masturbate everyday, masturbation for me has always helped with relaxing and releasing sexual tensions, and, it’s pleasurable of course. This is where things start to take a turn. I was diagnosed with OCD as a young child, around 12ys old. However I didn’t start taking meds until I was 16. These past few months my OCD has been at an all time high, mostly when it comes to being sexual. Every time I masturbate it becomes a debilitating process. After I “finish” I have convinced myself that my semen is everywhere in my room and I have to hose everything down with Lysol and wipe it down completely, this includes my bed sheets, tables, dressers, everything. It’s so fucking annoying. I really wish I could just masturbate and call it done like how I used to, but that’s just not the case. It takes me about 30 minutes to clean up, even though there isn’t any visible mess, I think it’s lingering around my room, and then what if I track that mess around my house and it goes around my family members, and then that makes me a weirdo because I was being selfish for no  cleaning up. then I’m even more gross. I can only masturbate like once a week because I hate having to do all of these ritualistic things after I masturbate. I can’t even enjoy it even more, what used to bring me pleasure, brings me fear and anxiety. If it was up to me, I wouldn’t masturbate at all, but the hormones of a teenage young adult are never ending. I just want to be able to please myself and not be in so much fear. I’m just exhausted and need to rant.",

It is incredibly hard to deal with since I had developed little to no coping mechanisms as a child (I would normally just have panic attacks/meltdowns whenever I would get intrusive thoughts or severe anxiety when I was a kid) so I have noticed that's how I am reacting to it again despite being 19 now. \n\nEverytime the intrusive thoughts flare up or the routines I have made are even slightly broken I get flooded with awful, anxiety ridden thoughts and break down and cry. I have no idea how to deal with it and feel like I am trapped in my adult body with the mentality of when I was a kid.\n\nIt's like just existing is enough to scare me now, I have bad agoraphobia and can hardly even leave my house without having a panic attack. I had bad existential dread related intrusive thoughts when I was little and it's like they've come back just to ruin my life even more.\n\nI should also mention I have MDD and am currently taking my first antidepressant. If I break routines and do as I please I get more depressed but staying within the confines of the mental routines I have made for myself make my OCD worse. I don't know what to do... I can't just do exposure therapy when the thing freaking me out is my own brain, I just feel extremely scared and hopeless right now.",

And they are interlinked in my mind and because I am not doing my spiritual rituals, I feel ugly. Not just like “oh I don’t like my outfit”, no it’s like I want to crawl into myself and I don’t feel welcome inside of my own skin and if I look in the mirror I have to fix every single thing that I am not pleased with. I spend thousands of dollars on clothes and skin care and my hair as well and I genuinely feel trapped. Lately, I have been isolating myself and avoiding taking photos because in order for me to feel okay being perceived I HAVE to do my hair and my skin care and my makeup and yoga and take my vitamins and do affirmations in the mirror to feel the least bit okay with the way that I look, which takes hours.

        "Text": "I've always had ocd. Recently found out I'm AuDHD too. Thoughts usually ranged from harm, sexual orientation, death and germs. Its awful, but something I guess I just learned to live with. I never got proper help until the last few years.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, around this time of year I experienced a sexual assault. This has really increased my symptoms to the point where its unbearable.\n\nI've been with my partner for nearly 3 and half years, and when I'm having a bad episode I obsess over miscommunication we've had, and times we've done things when we've been drinking. I worry I wasn't in a good state, and then due to the passage of time I question what happened. \n\nMy boyfriend refused the first time I wanted to while drinking as was worried I'd not be happy. Another time we did (We weren't in a proper relationship at this point, just seeing each other) and he said I was pretty persistant (which has then lead to the thought that I'm some sort of monster/deviant) and got upset thinking he didn't fancy me.\n\nWe ended up trying (I have vagimosis) and he from what I remember was very respectful, asking me if I was okay. I had to stop because of the pain. And I think I then cried afterwards because I felt like a freak due to my condition. He comforted me.\n\nI think I remember the next day not being the happiest, I think just because of my values when I'm sober would mean I'd have wanted it to be special. My upbringing there was a LOT of influence from my family about when you should/shouldn't have sex, and I think I've really put a lot of pressure on myself.\n\nAnyway, overtime I've started worrying I wasn't okay to consent, and I'm not sure if I fully remembered *everything* that night. There was (I think another night) where we were drinking and we were talking Bout having children and what they'd look like. My boyfriend said he wanted them to have his colour of hair, and I cried thinking he hated my hair (I'm sure you've guessed I maybe wasn't in the best place then).\n\nI'm worried that was the same night. At first my boyfriend thought so too/wasn't sure but now he says he thinks they were different nights. He wants me to try and not worry about it. When I'm doing REALLY well I don't think about it much, but right now I'm thinking bout it like it's SA.\n\nLike surely that's not a good state to be in right?\n\nIt got so bad that I asked my boyfriend if we don't do anything while intoxicated or which alcohol involved at all. He's respected this 100% and even stopped me when I've tried to go against this rule, even after we've had no intimacy in a long time and I was all over him. He could have taken advantage of that but didn't.\n\nI'm struggling right now. Does this all sound dodgy? Or does it sound like ocd/trauma?\n\nI don't know if I'm ever going to be the same person again after what happened. I never used to be like this. I reported the SA, after it ate me alive for 3 years and nothing was done. Sometimes the thoughts make me feel so awful.",

However, i’m not so much looking for verification on how good/bad my actions are but sometimes I feel that I want to say what has happened in order to get advice on how to process it specifically.

For my own sake, but I'd like to improve things for my own sake.\n\nSo... what exactly does it look like when you've gone through therapy and treatment after awhile. Months, years, whatever. Is it common to be able to avoid the triggers and live a mostly-normal life? Or is it like when you are an addict, get clean, and you hear everyone say \"you're going to think about it every day, forever\"?\n\nI'm just curious about realistic end-goals for myself. If the impulsive thoughts to check or do things can legitimately go away. And if I can just... be normal. Or relatively normal, anyway!\n\nIf any of you have been through it all and gone through treatment, I'd really like to hear what life is like afterwards. Thanks!",

During our last session, she asked me to think about an OCD behavior I’d like to tackle. I’m supposed to let her know what I decided during our next session, which is this upcoming Wednesday. Most of my behaviors revolve around cleanliness and include:\n\n•Showering as soon as I’m home any time I leave the house. \n•Washing/disinfecting anything that enters the house (groceries, clothes, etc.).\n•Disinfecting the house after visitors leave (since I can’t have them shower after entering the house lol).\n•Regularly disinfecting door knobs, cabinet handles, and door switches. \n•Disinfecting areas that have been touched by “unclean” items (such as the counter where the mail is placed).\n\nI’m having trouble deciding what to tackle because, even though I realize these behaviors are a result of my OCD and I want to improve, I also can’t fathom the mere thought of not doing these things. It just feels impossible and horrible to not do these things. I know I want to get better, but I also can’t imagine doing so if that makes sense. \n\nAny thoughts and/or advice will be greatly appreciated. ",

My total time of recovery was 2 months with restrictions, everything past that was pretty normal! \n\nThe problem is…. I can’t stop thinking of that day. It’s almost 1 year post op for me and I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. and not in a good way. \nMy other types of ocd, i’ve learned to manage and control my ocd. \n\nThis situation though, is definitely OCD based. \nI have told my therapist about this and he said, “ you went into pre-op, extremely uncomfortable and unhappy with your chest and it was a complete 180 turn. You went from a huge size to a normal comfortable size. You have been waiting for this surgery for years and now it’s over, you did it”. \n\nI agree with what he said but all i want to do is re-do the surgery over and over and over again. I want to have this surgery done every 2 weeks. I want my stitches back, I want to be watching shows non stop, I want to be in post-op recovery again. \n\nEveryday I want to wake up with my pre-op boobs and then wake up with my post-op size. \n\nI don’t understand why I can’t get over this but I know it’ll be much harder to get over this because my surgeon is not gonna do a 1 year post op surgery again. so it’s over. i just don’t know how to stop thinking and obsessing over it. \ni’ve wrote about my feelings, sketch my before and after boobs. i just don’t know what to do. i’m stuck in this loophole of wanting to have the same surgery done every 2 weeks.

I would spend all day every day fixating and ruminating so much that I became depressed. There was never a moment when my mind wasn’t racing with thoughts. I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night for years because my mind wouldn’t stop. I’ve been isolating myself for 2 years and didn’t feel like doing anything that I had enjoyed previously. My SI was rapidly increasing and became hopeless.\n My therapist finally convinced me to see a psychiatrist to get medication. He wanted to order genetic testing because I had been on 2 SSRIs in the past for anxiety and had bad side effects from both. Testing showed I cannot take any SSRIs and only 4 medications were in the green for me. So he put me on 25 mg of Pristiq. I noticed it helped my depression and anxiety a little but not the obsessive rumination or fixating. When I had my follow up he increased the Pristiq dosage to 50 mg and added a medication called Clonidine.  I began these meds on Tuesday and I haven’t been ruminating or fixating since. My mind is not racing with thoughts. It’s calm. I’ve never experienced a calm mind in my life. I don’t know which medication is the one that is helping but I’m hoping this lasts.  ",

I also wanted to commit suicide because i didn’t have emotions but before i took medications i never really had such toughts which is weird i think maybe i was panicked even tho I didn’t feel panic at all and that’s why maybe. I stopped to take this medication because of these thoughts. My doctor said it’s going to be better and my emotions will return if i take for longer but a lot of people said it’s a common side effect for ssri medications and it will not really go away maybe if i took bupropion with it. My question is should i start taking it again because emotional numbness go away or should i try a different medication?

At bedtime I try to escape into a daydream that helps me fall asleep (ruminating gives me insomnia) but it's been hard to not ruminate when im already so mentally exhausted. \n\nI don't know what I'm looking for but if anyone has any advice or similar stories so I don't feel alone I think it'll help. Maybe even what I can bring up to my therapist to try and get her to understand better so I can get more help. ",

I'm not sure how she thinks I'm doing it, but I'm going to have to somehow prove it to her and I don't think I'll ever be able to prove that I'm not.\n\nI know that this is probably my fault for going to her with my fear in the first place, but I felt like I needed to tell her.

This happens over, and over, and over, until I finally for some reason think it's okay now.\n\nThere is literally 0 rationality in these thoughts, but the fear is so debilitating, as because if I somehow did get in contact, I would have an 100% chance of death. I hate it so much, and my hands are so cut up and irritated from washing even moving them hurts like hell.\n\nIt doesn't help that my school has had like, I dunno, 3 animals get within the campus (the outdoor area) so that only fuels my delusional thinking and that I somehow got into contact with one. I'm currently at school typing this, and I'm probably going to wash my hands again soon.\n\nWhenever I try to reason that it's ridiculous, the fear is either too much, or my mind creates false memories that didn't happen, making me wash.\n \nAre there like meds that would calm this down??? I've never really taken pills, but I'd gladly do so if it meant this ended",

If I read something or find something out that is pertinent to me and my OCD grabs onto it, I spiral. With narcolepsy, I recently learned that a large portion of people have difficulty differentiating between dream and reality and as a result can have false memories. This has kicked my OCD into OVERDRIVE and I am now hyperfixated and convinced that all of my memories are made up and fake. It seems that most people that experience this have sleep paralysis (which I don't) and usually it pertains to benign things, like thinking they had a conversation they didn't have. But as it does, my OCD is blowing this whole thing up and out of proportions. I have lived my whole life with the fear that I don't have a sense of reality, or I am \"losing my mind\", or that nothing is real. And now, here I am, with a diagnosis that might actually mean that my fears are true. This is a nightmare.\n\nAny advice? Guidance? I'm having a huge existential crisis over here. :(",

        "Text": "Hey. Sorry for the long post, but I'm spiraling. \n\nI'm a 28 year old man who's always struggled to keep a job. For a little backstory,  I was first diagnosed with OCD about ten years ago. Though, I think I've had symptoms since I was a kid. I was going to a psychiatrist for a little while, but they have closed down a long time ago. There isn't another one in my area. I've been getting some medicine prescribed through my normal doctor, but the results have been mixed. It's made my life pretty hard. My mother, and brother also have it so I think it's genetic, but I digress.\n\nI've had like 20 jobs over the course of 9 years. Sad, I know. I struggle to keep one for more than a few months at a time. As a result, its pretty hard to find decent work. I usually end up in fast food or retail. Which, if any of you know, fucking sucks in its own right without any OCD.\n\nThis is what always happens. I'll be fine for the first couple weeks, but slowly get worse as time goes by. At first, I don't have any obsessions or \"rules\" about how to do my job. I do what I'm asked to do, and everyone's happy. I'm a fast learner, and people always compliment my performance for the first little bit. \n\nBut the longer I stay, and get more familiar with it, my OCD always creeps up. It turns into constant obsessions and compulsive behavior that cripples me. I try to hide it but it's obvious I'm doing things weird. I never tell anyone why, I just let them assume I'm stupid or something for doing things in an odd way. It eventually gets to the point that I'm in a constant state of panic all day just doing simple tasks. My performance plummets, and I end up missing a lot of work until I'm either fired, or quit because I can't do it anymore. It's embarrassing. People look at me like I'm just lazy, but in reality I'm fighting an invisible war in my head that I can't tell them about.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I actually managed to get a decent job at my local school district. It's the longest I've ever worked at one place, actually. It was going good, but the last couple of weeks have been torture. Constantly late because I can't get out of the shower in time, redoing and checking my work over and over to the point of tears, etc. The other day I was trying to fight it off, but it's gotten much worse. I'm at the point now where I don't know how much longer I can go. I'm falling into the same cycle again, pissing off my family in the process. I still live at home, too because I don't make enough to live on my own. \n\nI've missed a lot of work recently, and I'm worried I'm about to lose the best job I've had. My boss is nice enough, but I haven't told her what's wrong. I I know I shouldn't be, but I can't help but feel ashamed of myself. I feel like like I'm letting everyone down again. \n\nDoes anyone else have this problem? What can I do?\n\nTLDR: OCD has made it hard to hold down a job And I'm about to lose the only one I've been able to keep longer than a couple months.\n",

He said what I described sounds like OCD, however I'm doubting his assessment.\n\nI was expecting a more comprehensive assessment that also involved conducting a differential diagnosis, but I don't think he did that.\n\nSo, now I want to more clearly define what OCD actually is, because I'm not sure if I should trust him or not, and it seems like it can manifest in different ways. The main goal would be for treatment reasons - If I'm diagnosed incorrectly, then I don't know if we can treat my issues in the way that OCD issues would be treated.\n\nI don't know how treatment can apply in situations where there is a possibility that you need to take action to address a problem from a mistake, but when I explain the situation to people, they tell me it's fine and nothing needs to be done at all. It can feel like being gaslit.\n\nThis is my understanding of OCD so far (don't take any of this explanation as fact, I'm trying to learn about the condition):\n\nThere can be only obsessions, only compulsions, or both. \n\nObsessions are thoughts that cannot be easily rid of and cause distress.\n\nCompulsions are actions performed to either ease distress from an obsession, or to avoid a negative outcome. Seems to be that, when referenced in relation to avoiding a negative outcome, the compulsions are not logical. Meaning, the behaviours involved do not realistically influence the result of a feared outcome. Unclear if this is always the case. Unclear how compulsions can manifest in relation to easing distress caused by an obsession, and if they can be defined as illogical. If a behaviour is easing worry, then is that not logical?\n\nHave also learned that the physical structure of the brain is different in people with OCD compared to non-OCD.\n\nUnclear if specific obsessions can last for years? \n\nEgo-dystonic experience seems to be referenced in two ways; in relation to intrusive thoughts which relate to Harm OCD, e.g. thoughts that you will hurt someone even if you don't want to hurt anyone. And in relation to the level of belief people have in the logic of their OCD thoughts. The DSM mentions that the level of insight sufferers experience is on a spectrum (full insight to no insight).\n\nUnclear if OCD is only 24/7, or can be triggered and experienced in an episodic/acute way?\n\nMy experience is the latter - triggered by events that can result in an outcome I believe would be devastating. The DSM says it has to impact at least an hour of your life daily, so I don't know how I could get a diagnosis to begin with considering I have stretches where I'm fine.\n\nMy main 'theme' (not sure if I can call it a theme at this stage) would be contamination and disease/illness concerns. But it's not limited to that. I believe that any concern I have is always born from an action I took (e.g. making a mistake), or from something that happened to me. I only have one example of a time that could be classified as false OCD which caused considerable stress, and is something I am still unsure of even now. \n\nI seem to be more concerned than those around me about contracting disease, however I would say the measures I take to manage this are logical. It makes sense to me to not want to use baskets at grocery stores, or be wary of door handles in public toilets. \n\nIf I feel I have been exposed to something, I spiral and catastrophize, and the incident replays in my mind, and I either; go over the situation hoping that there is something there that can prove that I was not exposed and will be fine, or, I will replay the exact moments I feel were 'damning' (the image flashes in my mind), which is also associated with a stab of anxiety in my stomach. I end up researching online looking for hope that I will be fine, but a lot of the time it can't be found because there IS a chance, even if slim (probability stops existing and I feel like I'm doomed. If there is a chance, then in my mind it is likely).\n\nEverything I've been stressed about in this way has been dismissed by others as something I should not be bothered worrying about. Every single time. MOST OF THE TIME, this reassurance from others is enough and my anxiety is eased, but not every time. I feel very reliant on the reassurance of others, though. I often can't reassure myself, only someone else can. After receiving reassurance, I often feel the anxiety starts to dissipate and I can look back on what I was worried about and feel fine about it (but not every time).\n\nI would really describe these moments as acute incidents that can last from a few days to a whole month. \n\nThe level of worry during these incidents is excessive and has interfered with my quality of life at times. I've felt unable to eat or get out of bed from the anxiety and ruminating. Sometimes feeling like I don't deserve to be happy when I'm obsessing over a mistake I think could have disastrous consequences, or thinking I can't enjoy my life because my freedom is going to be taken away soon (e.g. going to jail or having to appear in court, or preparing how to live with myself if a feared consequence comes true because of a mistake I made).\n\nThis post got a bit messy towards the end. I want to discuss more with my psychologist when I see them next. Appreciate any comments or insights.",

        "Text": "okay so lately I’ve been having this obsession that I might be cheating on my boyfriend. I know for sure that I would NEVER cheat or betray him like that but I can’t stop thinking that I might. \n\nWhenever I talk to a guy I over analyze everything I’m saying to make sure I’m not being disloyal. I purposely move away from guys and avoid talking to them in fear that I’ll accidentally cheat or say something wrong. I also feel this constant need to “confess” to my boyfriend after I’ve talked to a guy so I make sure I’m not hiding anything from him and I can get some kind of reassurance that I didn’t cheat. My boyfriend is absolutely amazing but he gets incredibly jealous too which makes it worse. It’s even gotten to the point where it’s seeping into my dreams. I’ve had multiple dreams of hugging, kissing and flirting with other guys waking up feeling like absolute shit and like a horrible person. I can’t be in peace around men anymore cause I’m too busy analyzing if I’m cheating and it’s killing me. \n\nIf anyone could give some advice or support that would be much appreciated. 🫶",

        "Text": "Hi reddit! I have ABSOLUTELY no clue how to describe the psychological phenomenon I'm about to ask about so PLEASE bear with me. An acquaintance of mine (who gave me consent to post this) was having a discussion with me about her OCD and the interesting habits that come along with it, when she mentioned something super fascinating I have never heard of before.\n\nShe said that she cannot stand in certain places of a room because the \"lines that come from furniture will hit her\". I asked her to elaborate and she said that the \"edges\" or \"lines\" of furniture continue in space and will \"hit her\" if she stands in certain points of the room. I asked if it makes her uncomfortable when the lines \"impale her\" and she says its a subconscious thing at this point and she can almost \"feel it in her temples\" when there is a line \"impaling\" her. She also says she knows the exact position to lay in in her bed where the lines from her nightstand and dressers aren't touching her. It's not just furniture though. For example, if she had a sheet of paper in front of her on a table, it cannot be facing her directly, because the lines from the sides of it will hit her, so she has to turn the paper so it is slanted.\n\nCould this somehow be related to her OCD? Has anybody else even heard of something like this? It's so interesting and I need answers. I have never heard of anyone else experiencing this.",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "Well, I just found out today from Chat GPT that I have a rare form of OCD called sensorimotor OCD. I always thought I was alone in my symptoms because I quite literally have never ever heard anyone else talk about having these types of thoughts in my entire life, and this is coming from someone who studied psych and is vocal about mental health. This type of OCD is rare, often undiagnosed, and still unknown to many people including mental health professionals because it’s not common. Here is a description of Sensorimotor OCD: \n\nSensorimotor OCD is a type of OCD where a person becomes intensely focused on automatic bodily functions that most people don’t consciously notice. This could include things like breathing, blinking, swallowing, or even the way their body feels while sitting or standing.\n\nImagine that instead of these actions happening in the background, as they do for most people, your mind suddenly fixates on them. You become hyper-aware of each breath, blink, or swallow, and you can’t “un-notice” it. The more you try to ignore it, the more attention it demands. It’s like when someone tells you to think about your breathing, and suddenly you can’t stop being aware of it—but for someone with sensorimotor OCD, this heightened awareness doesn’t go away and can last for hours, days, or even longer.\n\nPeople with sensorimotor OCD might feel anxiety or frustration over these sensations, as they try to get their focus off something that’s meant to be automatic. They may feel compelled to “control” these functions in some way or worry about them becoming disrupted. It’s not something they can easily turn off, and the fixation often feels intrusive, much like other OCD obsessions, which can be exhausting and distressing.\n\nIt’s different from general anxiety in that the focus is often very specific and persistent, with the mind latching onto these bodily functions in a way that disrupts daily life and feels very hard to control.\n\nEdit: I asked you guys if you HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THIS. THAT IS THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD. I didn’t ask to be lectured on how it’s not actually rare, how ChatGPT is terrible, etc. I asked one single question and maybe one person commenting actually answered because everyone on here is apparently an OCD expert that wants to lecture me on how common this is. Guess what— that’s what I was trying to figure out! Which is why I asked the question that not one person answered. And guess what? It DOESNT EVEN MATTER how common it is. What does that have to do with anything? Who cares if I think it’s rare vs not rare? Please get a grip & dont comment if you can’t answer the only question I asked. If me calling it rare pissed you off that much you could maybe seek some help for that too",

I'm also in a state of depersonalization (which was activated by grief and physical unwellness). I have read a lot about harm OCD and now, I have a lot more questions and doubts in me. Maybe, some of you could give me some advice. \n\nMy harm OCD latched itself onto my loved ones. It's funny to be because a month ago, I was crying just thinking about losing my parents because they are the only people that I have in my life. And now, baam, intrusive thoughts give me the absolute most vile thoughts. Combined with depersonalization, I feel like I have no control since my entire body and mind feel so foreign. It constantly makes me wonder, if my body will lose control on its own and just do these horrible things. I've been losing sleep, appetite, my heart is constantly pounding, headaches, ear pressure and I have severe anxiety (yesterday, it made me retch all day as well). I also have this sort of a brain fog, which makes me worry I'll just \"snap\" one day and not even realize it. It's been about a week and it's scary, because it came on so sudden.\n\nMy thoughts are mostly about either hitting myself, my loved ones, throwing something, etc. And it's like a movie in my head. And then, I feel this strange sensation in my hands and body, as if it wants to \"check\" if I can do this. I don't know, like grabbing an object to see if I'll throw it at someone. Or to make me say to my loved ones that I'm a danger to them. It's so hard to fight against it because it feels like a mind of its own. I've cried yesterday all day, because I was convinced I'm just a psycho, who's going to end up on TV as someone who harmed her family and then locked in jail forever. Just writing this gives me a headache. I've never had to deal with this and this feeling of \"no control\" spikes my anxiety so much. And then, I also worry that if I won't be as phased and worried about these thoughts anymore, that I've accepted them and will actually do them. Or that deep inside, this is some sort of a desire. I could never harm my loved ones. It's so hard to describe it. I've read that you're supposed to accept these thoughts but my god, that makes me feel like I give the thoughts a better ability to make them happen.\n\nI don't want to go on meds, as I have horrible experience with them. Therapy isn't really a thing here. So, I'm mostly on my own. I've lost interest into my daily activities as well. It's just so crippling. My mind is active 24/7 and it's constantly making me doubt everything. Myself, my sanity, my control. How do you live with this? I feel so weak that I can't do regular activities. Is there really a way out of this? Will the depersonalization go away? I'm so scared. ",

After that I found this sub and have been a long time lurker, learning more about OCD and feeling more seen than I ever have before.\n\nAnyway, today I overcame a phobia I’ve had for as long as I can remember and I had my blood drawn at the doctor! This phobia has been so severe that for the last 15 years (I’m 31 now) I have not been able to have this simple procedure done. The last time I did, it was against my will and was not even a full panel, and before that I had only had it drawn maybe twice that I can remember. \n\nIt feels a little silly sharing it with lots of others since this is seen as something so routine, but I am so proud of myself and how far I’ve come with my medication/treatment to be able to do this. It’s wonderful to feel one step closer to living a “normal” life and removing what were previously hard and arbitrary boundaries.\n\nI hope others in this sub can appreciate this win! ",

CMHT has agreed to start me on Fluoxetine - not yet picked up or started taking.\n\nSince then so many things have gone wrong. Arranged to meet with someone 4 times this week and multiple things each time, have gone wrong to stop this happening and I feel like it's punishment for snitching on my brain. And now I'm too scared to take the medication I've been asking for, for over a year, because I feel like that's gonna jinx me further and I'm scared of what's going to happen and I don't know what to do. I've had enough of all this. My mental health has severely deteriorated this last year and the OCD really has destroyed so much which is why I've been fighting to get the prescription but now I can't take it and I can't tell anyone and I'm scared. I can't do this anymore.",

I have tried almost every medication with no luck so far. I am currently on 40mg Paxil and today my doctor prescribed me 5mg Abilify to take with the Paxil since the Paxil alone didn’t help at all. I am also on lamictal for my bipolar. My main question is does anyone else use this medicine combo (Paxil+abilify) I’m really nervous to start taking my abilify before I hear how it was for others or if it’s safe together.

        "Text": "I have had pure OCD my whole life and in the past 2 months I’ve only just found out about it. This last 2 months has been up there with one of the hardest things I’ve had to get through but I’ve been making amazing progress. A lot of my fears are starting to go away and have already gone and although I feel as if I’m in so much more mental torment than before, I feel the strongest and most free I’ve ever felt from it. It’s strange but a lot of people here will understand what I’m talking about. It’s the anxiety you get but the compulsions and obsessions fade.\n\nAnyway. There been this one obsession that is incredibly annoying and I’ve looked everywhere and I can’t seem to find anything on here or on the internet about it but I’m sure some of you guys have probably had this obsession. To get to the point, I’ve had this random and strange obsession with Elon musk and i don’t know how to shake it.\n\nWhen ever I think about my future goals and what I want to do I always feel like I’m not being “useful” enough. I’m always comparing myself to him or I have this little voice in the back of my head that makes me feel “not as good as Elon musk” \n\nAt the moment I am studying to get a diploma in personal training in college and might go on to do a degree because I love training people and I love the science that goes into it. Since I was 14 I’ve loved the gym and I’ve always had a love for science before then. I love bodybuilding and have only just been able to come back to the gym after a year of recovering from open spine surgery which fueled my want for science even more. I wish to be successful in my business and look to bring my 3d and filming skills into it. \n\nDuring my recovery I had a short phase of constantly thinking about the scientist Oppenheimer and how I wanted to make some huge contribution to science even though I never really liked physics but then it just went. \n\nBut this is worse. Since Elon musk owns 6 businesses, is the richest man alive and is probably getting us to mars in our lifetime makes me feel like I’ve got even more to achieve. I’ve never cared about being an entrepreneur or something to do with space. I mean everyone would love to be an astronaut in zero g but Jesus Christ. So would everyone like to be a ripped bodybuilder but not everyone on earth devotes their life to it! It’s this obsession with not being useful to humanity. If I’m not as useful as him what’s the point of my existence. Very dark I know and I know that’s not how life works. I used to think the guy who did my surgery was top one percentage god like person who helps people (which he is, he’s helped thousands of people with scoliosis like me!, couldn’t be more thankful!) but now my ocd has distorted me to think a being someone in that level is no where near as good enough as being Elon musk. It’s ridiculous I hate it! I look at people like Jeff bezos and Steve Jobs who have affect our lives more than Elon I would say but my OCD doesn’t bat an eye. Maybe it’s because he’s cool and relatable as I’m just going through being a dumb edgy teenager. \nI sometimes get the thought “if it was me or Elon to die, everyone would pick me because my use to this world isn’t as substantial as him!” I know that’s not gonna happen and I know that’s not the sole meaning of life. But then I question the meaning of life that is a whole other can of poo I’m not opening. I know that’s if that was the case, the whole world wouldn’t be alive and only a few people would live, all the farmers and nurses would be gone who hold up the world. It’s like cogs in a big machine but my OCD just can accept that. It’s paradoxical and stupid. I am aware that polarised thinking (all or nothing) is a big part of OCD but my god this sucks.\n\nAnyway as well as a question that was a vent, but it has to come out somewhere. If I tried explaining it to anyone else it would just come out as unintelligible garbage.\n\nGlad to get that off my chest!\n\nHope people here find this useful and I’m still making great progress and I’m feeling optimistic for the future. Just remember, don’t pray for easy lives (compulse), pray to be stronger men! (Resist)\n\nSorry for bad grammar it won’t let me change it for some reason.",

I noticed that my mind suddenly slowed down and I felt like I could think clearly for the first time. I realized the following: What, on earth, have I been doing?\n\nI have a sheer endless amount of obsessions: Ranging from: My home is contaminated, the air, the furniture, there is mold everywhere (there isn't), perfectionism, my sleep isn't good enough, my monitor, chair isn't good enough. My obsession is the strongest with sleep, because to me, I \\*think\\* that if my sleep is bad, my obsessions get worse. So I tell myself that because I slept badly, that my obsessions are the worst today. But my obsessions include my sleep, so it leads to an endless cycle of me obsessing over my sleep, over my mattress, my bedding, the air quality at night etc. etc.\n\nBut now, my mind just slowed down. And I realized that I don't need perfect sleep. Good enough sleep is good, too. Maybe there is mold in my home. But even if, the human body is able to handle small amounts of it. Plus, other people wouldn't even worry whether something smells weirdly in their home. They just do stuff without worrying about strange things.\n\nWith that mindset in mind, I didn't engage with my compulsions for a day. I felt soul crushing internal pain from not engaging, it felt so, so difficult. But after a day it got better. The obsessions are still there. I can ignore them better now though.\n\nAnother thing I noticed however: I am autistic. Sertraline doesn't make me un-autistic. Sertraline doesn't fix my overstimulation. Not even Sertraline can stop me from having anxiety when I go to uni, along a street with thousands of cars, smell, narrow streets, noise, bad air quality, to a place where thousands of people are crowded in narrow buildings.\n\nBut I am also easily under-stimulated. I am someone who loves doing new things, meeting new people, learning new stuff. Etc. Where I currently live, the only comfortable is my home. And uni. Travelling inbetween is a nightmare regarding anxiety response, over-stimulation and all that. It doesn't help there is only one (1) street to uni I can choose, and it is by far the worst one, directly through an area with lots of industry and all the things I mentioned.\n\nStress is the #1 factor in my life triggering my OCD. I need to change my living environment drastically, because right now, I \\*hate\\* my place. My home is the only place looking not ugly in this city. And that leads to frustration. Frustration leads to restlessness. After a nice weekend of feeling relaxed, I go to uni, thinking nothing can stop me. But then I get the worst overstimulation of my life, I go home and my mind is racing from adrenaline, from anxiety. It doesn't help that my home is also situated nearby an industrial side with actual air pollution, noise from traffic etc. So I go to uni, which is overstimulating, travelling is overstimulating, and my home is also overstimulating regarding environmental pollution. You can imagine how I feel then.\n\nNow imagine that for days, weeks, years. Every single day I have to force myself to endure this stress to go to uni. Every single day. What is more frustrating is that I love uni. The courses are great. It's the rest that is horrible. So I am motivated to go to uni, only to then find myself getting a near panic attack every day from travelling.\n\nOf course if you have to endure stress daily you will start feeling horrible when you go home. You worry about your sleep, because if you sleep well, your stress tolerance for the next day is even lower. You worry about the air, because you need to be able to think properly for your homework. And more.\n\nI had this first realization of my autism being the cause of my OCD after taking sertraline for a month. I had vacation. I felt like I could change the world after taking it for 4 weeks, nothing could stop me. I was keen on making new friends when I returned from vacation, picking up new hobbies, fulfilling my work schedule for university.\n\nThe first day, I went to uni filled with motivation. That was until I stepped out of my apartment and went to take the bus to commute to uni. I realized my anxiety returning as soon as I saw the street with thousands of cars, as soon as I noticed the air pollution, the narrow streets with narrow sidewalks in hilly areas. Then I took the bus, which was crowded to the brim, which further increased my anxiety. I commuted to uni, looked outside the windows and saw the dozens of construction sides, the dust on the street from the insane amount of air pollution. I went to the lecture hall, which was filled with hundreds of students, pushing themselves through the entrance doors. Later, I went to the canteen which was filled with even more students, noise everywhere from people talking, me having to wait in a full line for half a hour, people pushing around. Later, I went home, again the same busses filled to the brim, went home, noticed the air pollution again, the construction noises. My mind was racing, I felt like I have experienced a near death experience. I felt so anxious, so stressed. Nothing has changed to pre Sertraline.\n\nFrom that day, I knew what my problem is: My problem is autism. If it takes one, and I repeat one day for my OCD to return simply as a result of stress, I know what the problem is. Autism. When I am stressed is where my obsessions are at its peak. I go home from uni, and think about, say, throwing everything away I own. Because why not?\n\nI envy American universities because they offer an actual \"campus like\" experience, away from the insanity that cities are. Where I live, universities are just like schools. Sure, there are accomodations. If you get such, otherwise you have to search for living space in the private sector in the cheapest, most ugly areas of the city.\n\nI need to remove this stress factor from my life. I am a hard working, ambitious person. I am not lazy. I love studying for university, I love living a healthy life. But my body, my autism is setting me limitations. Limitations which I cannot ignore. When not even Sertraline helps, you know you need to change something in your life.\n\nWhatever it is, I am not willing to live the rest of my 60+ years with daily stress. I have a right, just like every other human, to live a life without daily anxiety, a life without stress, a life without suffering. And I am more than willing to pursue that goal. But it is hard. It is hard with the autism, it is hard with my current living locations, with my feeling of isolation where I live. But I am willing to fight through this. I have to, because the alternative is worse: Daily anxiety, daily compulsions, obsessions, and more.\n\nIt doesn't help that my family doesn't understand my autism. It doesn't help that my psychiatrist doesn't understand my autism. It doesn't help that anyone from the mental health sector I talked with understands my autism. They only focus on the following: My OCD, and my anxiety. They say that it is an expression of a restless mind, an expression that I want to meet people, that I want to do things that are fun, an expression of wanting to explore new things. They are right. But they don't understand it is my autism that makes me unable to enjoy friendships, relationships, hobbies, going outside. They don't understand my overstimulation, because they are normal. Nothing against normal people. I wish I were like them. But they will never be able to understand my viewpoint because they never worry about, e.g., street noise when commuting.\n\nMy OCD, my anxiety is a result of me being unable to fulfill my desires: Friendships, hobbies, relationships, not having stress daily. As a result, I get restless, frustrated and worry about weird things because my mind is frustrated. I am overstimulated, but also easily understimulated. If anyone has any idea how to approach this contraction, let me now. I feel the most comfortable when I sit for hours infront of my computer, because the pixels offers me an infinite amount of stimulation, yet I don't have to worry about other stimulation around me. But real life expects me to go outside, which I respect. But I don't know how to deal with this overstimulation. This might be more appropriate for autism subreddit, but I think maybe someone with OCD and autism has experience here and can share their experiences and how they approached it?",

I must place things or do things at work in a certain order or else I can’t focus or essentially forget the steps because someone said another way was easier, but it impedes on my system of thought. I’m a surgical assistant at an oral surgeons office. We had a patient move while under light sedation and their blood draw catheter came out. They bled like a fountain. I stepped in when I realized what was happening, I removed the tourniquet (the rubber band kind they tie on your arm) and applied pressure to the bleeding to cause it to cease. None of my coworkers said anything about that operation or how I reacted during it. I’m fairly new and I have always been someone to seek validation. If I don’t know that I’m doing well with whatever task, then I don’t know if I’ll be able to continue without messing up. I feel like I did everything right. Do I take them not saying anything or correcting me as me doing a good job of handling the situation?? ",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "For some background, around a year ago I suffered an horrific OCD flare up (a condition I've greatly suffered from since early childhood) which was largely purely obsessional. It revolved around recurring thoughts people were conspiring against me (I knew in my mind it wasnt true but I still had to perform rituals to 'cancel out' what they were doing) and that I was weird to other people and everything I said they were judging me relentlessly. This caused me to become severely anxious and withdraw from seeing friends. These new symptoms were in addition to the rituals I'd had all my life.  I tried Nicotine to ease the thoughts which helped somewhat at the start and evolved into further worsening of the intrusive thoughts. I'd wake up early with butterflies in my stomach and recurring intrusive thoughts. My girlfriend got pregnant around this time which added to the worries and likely flared it up further. I never wanted children because it would have been disastrous for me mentally and I was right. \n\nFluoxetine:\n\nI visited the doctor who tried Propanolol and Fluoxetine after he discovered my resting heart rate was 102bpm. The Propanolol helped slightly but after 5 weeks of treatment the Fluoxetine caused serious disassociation, panic attacks and anxiety i didn't even know was possible. \n\nMirtazapine (Remeron):\n\nA new doctor then decided to put me on Mirtazapine, which essentially wiped me out for 48 hours after taking my first dose. All was going well aside from weight loss and lethargy and my dose was eventually titrated up 15,30 then 45mg. I was on this dose for nearly a year (up until 6 weeks ago). For anxiety it worked well but it didn't put my back to my previous baseline of it being manageable, it really only changed the compulsions to cleanliness. I started getting nasty thoughts, hated everyone around me and felt no emotional connection to my newborn son. Everything my girlfriend did irritated me beyond words.\n\nI fantasied daily about leaving her for someone better and felt a lot of built up resentment towards her and anything she's ever done. I threw her out of the house and my newborn son for a week after an argument and felt zero remorse. I hated her and everyone around me being near me. I slept on the sofa for 7 months before I eventually wanted to end my life through sheer hopelessness. My family told me I was evil on the tablets and completely different. I'd talk with my mother daily on the phone for an hour prior to the medication and enjoyed talking to her - now I'd swear down the phone at her and ask her why she's bothering me. \n\nI was lethargic, slept until mid afternoon, didnt help with the baby and had no energy whatsoever. My muscles ached like I had arthritis. \n\nOddly enough, all of my focus issues went away that I have had all my life. I rediscovered my hobbies, enjoyed work and became work obsessed. Jobs I could never start got done and I was decently productive. This is making me push my doctors for an evaluation for ADHD. \n\n6 weeks ago,  the doctor agreed it wasn't normal and said I could just withdraw cold turkey which was agonising for 2 weeks. I couldn't concentrate, my business has suffered as a result and I've lost a lot of weight through lack of appetite/nausea. \n\nEscitaloprám (Lexapro):\n\nAfter agreeing I could just quit, the doctor instantly put me on Escitaloprám (Lexapro) 5mg.\n\nWeek 1:\nNothing to report \n\nWeek 2:\nInstant mood uplift, feel elated, more social and hypersexual (possibly result of quitting Mirtazapine?)\n\nWeek 3/4:\nMuch the same as Week 2, less intense \n\nWeek 5/6:\n\nUnable to sit still and restless, girlfriend and people irritate me, no motivation to do anything, can't concentrate, major brain fog, much reduced OCD symptoms (basically in remission), total loss of sex drive, hopelessness, nausea and headaches. \n\nTried quitting nicotine cold turkey but withdrawals unbearable. \n\n\n\n\nWhy do I react this way to antidepressents? I think at this point I'm done and need to quit it all. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "Text": "Within the last few months I have developed a compulsion where I must knock on wood after an intrusive thought. Intrusive thoughts are largely health related regarding me and my loved ones. This compulsion must be done with 10 total knocks, in a very specific rhythm, and if I mess it up I reset it by wiping it away. It has to be real wood. Recently I have developed the fun twist that if I think about any human, any person at all, that they will suffer a horrible fate or death unless I can do the entire sequence without thinking about them. It is too the point where I can see anything, like a towel, and think of the person who invented the towel and now they are going to die. That person likely isnt even around anymore. Have you ever tried not to think about something? Of course you all have. \n\nThis one is my biggest one. It started as such a (what I thought was) a lighthearted \"haha, knock on wood!\" and slowly developed into what it is now. And it keeps changing and adding on. My fear is what else is coming next. \n\nI must set alarms a specific way, I must have the earliest and latest at least an hour apart. There is an alarm every like, 2-3 minutes, just to be safe. I set my alarms, and then I have to, without blinking, in one swipe, swipe up and down the length of the alarm list twice and make sure I \"catch\" the alarm with my finger and the earliest and latest do not eave the screen. Following this, I must then hit the little toggle switch ten times up and down in a nice rhythm without messing up. If I mess that up, the alarm app gets cleared and I start the toggle switch again. Once I did that, then I have to do it 4 times on the toggle. Theres a few other little things in this process. It's normally followed up by a ten knock on my wood dresser. \n\n  \nWhen I leave the house I must say goodbye in a certain way to my dog and cat, and then my partner. If they do not say the goodbye back to me in the same way, I just cannot leave the house. Luckily my partner is very, very understanding and we work with disabilities and mental disorders etc, so it has not been a huge issue. \n\nI tried to tell my therapist about it and I was told \"welllll, everyone sometimes does the whole knock on wood thing. its like a social norm thing\". I explained to her that I keep a wood block in my car because if I think about crashing my car I have to knock on that damn wood or else its gonna happen. I never brought it up again. \n\nI started seeing a psychiatrist. I've only been a few times, and I have mentioned it. There are other medication related things were focused on right now, but addressing the OCD is on the docket. I'm terrified.\n\nMy earliest compulsion I remember was related to hand washing and counting. My brother has autism, and he had a hand washing thing too, so for years I thought I was just copying him as a kid, but I know now I really was distraught if I couldn't do it. \n\nI am in this field. I work with this and other disorders like it. I work with clients who have this. I went to school, I understand the brain and the science. I know it is all lies. So why can't I do it? ",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "Warning: this is long, and I apologize in advance. I will clarify anything needed in the comments.\n\nContext: This is an anonymous account I made. I am my wife's husband. This story is about my wife, daughter, and my daughter's friend. My wife has been diagnosed with Religious OCD/scrupulosity and she has been in a downward OCD spiral for nearly 10 days now after receiving a text from my daughter's friend's mom. It's severely impacting our marriage and her relationship to our children.\n\nFor even more context: my wife did not grow up in the best environment. There was no father present, only a distant and sometimes angry stepfather, and her mom is emotionally immature. She has also been plagued by OCD and depression for many years. However, as a kid, she was never treated. She was not treated until after we were married. And it wasn't until recently (within the last year) that we found what I think is the right combo of meds so that she finally started to receive the treatment she needs.\n\nApparently what happened (I was not there) is that my wife was letting our daughter and her friend (hereafter referred to as \"L\") play together. My wife already has what I consider to be an inordinate attachment to L because she - for some reason - views L as herself when she was young. She thinks L comes from a very similar family type (working, absent mother, angry supposedly abusive step-dad). I know L's family a little bit, and I honestly don't think that's the dynamic at play. L is very well behaved, obedient, and respectful. But L also likes to tell stories, and my wife pretty much believes whatever L tells her I think because she views L as a copy of herself and the situation she grew up in. So she's always trying to \"save\" her.\n\nSo, what happened that day was apparently L's step dad came and picked L up and was angry with L because my daughter and L were playing with neighborhood kids that L was not allowed to play with.  According to my 9 yo, L's stepdad apparently said something to the effect of \"Get in the fucking car!\" when he pulled up to get her. Again, I don't know. I was not there. I have met the stepdad before and he seems like a nice guy. But I wouldn't put it past him to have an outburst of anger. All parents do. Especially when L was playing with kids she knew she wasn't allowed to play with (my wife did not know L was not allowed to play with these kids).\n\nSome further context is needed: due to OCD and depression, before we found the right med my wife was prone to very angry outbursts. She was easily frustrated and had a very short fuse. This was also, I believe, a product of the environment she was raised in as her mom was the same way with her. So, in the past, my wife has gotten very frustrated when our kids would not listen and has all-out yelled at them when L has been over to spend the night. This was so bad once that it brought L to tears and made her afraid. And she called her mom and begged to go home. I had to get on the phone with the mom and smooth things over. So, L's mom knows my wife has emotional issues.\n\nSo, back to what happened. After my 9 yo tells my wife what happened, this sends my wife into a tailspin and she goes into \"savior\" mode. She send's L's mom a loooong text about what stepdad supposedly did and said. L's mom replies effectively telling her to butt out, that stepdad did not curse, and that my wife needs to focus on her own family. She told my wife that she does not think her concern for L is \"genuine\", especially when she has \"angry outbursts at her husband (me) and children\". She also said she thinks my wife is trying to be an \"instigator\".\n\nMy wife did not take this well and it has led to her for, I kid you not, the past 10 days now, being stuck in an OCD rut. Before this, she was on top of the world. She was on the right meds and I honestly had never seen her better. Nothing bothered her and she was making phenomenal progress. Now, it feels like she's been completely knocked off the ladder and starting all over again yet making no progress.\n\nFor some reason, this event has triggered the following:\n\n\\-Extreme religious OCD - fearing that L's mom revealed my wife's \"true self\" and that God has been mad at her all along and she's going to go to hell\n\n\\-Extreme PTSD (I guess? I don't know what to call it) - constantly telling me stories about bullies in school and what happened to her\n\n\\-Extreme rumination on past events\n\n\\-Little to no sleep at night\n\n\\-Catatonic and easily forgetting things in the day\n\n\\-Constantly asking for reassurance from me (which I take care not to provide so as not to feed the OCD cycle)\n\n\\-Constantly praying and asking for forgiveness for supposed passed \"sins\"\n\n\\-Near constant crying due to be filled with regret for past \"mistakes\"\n\nHonestly, she's gone from like a 9/10 down to a 0-1/10. And all in barely over a week. At first, she was trying to fight it. I could tell it was getting to her but she was determined to not hold on to it. To just let it pass. But as the days have worn on, she's only gotten worse.\n\nWe reached out to her psychiatrist who suggested she double her dose of Lamictal from 25mg to 50mg, which she has done and we're on day 2 of that now. Lamictal has been a life saver for her. It literally is what brought her up to the 9/10 she was before so I'm hopeful this increased dose will work in time.\n\nBut, what else can I do? Can a single comment in a text from a friend's mom really trigger this kind of OCD reaction? I'm at a loss. I'm trying to help her, but she is effectively incapacitated and I am having to shoulder all the work at home. It's been very difficult. She sees her talk therapist again this coming Wednesday and I'm hoping he can help her as well.\n\nBut, are there any coping strategies we could try? Should we ask if her other meds should be increased? In addition to the Lamictal 50mg, she's currently also on Vyvanse 50mg and Zoloft 25mg. And, like I said, prior to this incident, she was at 9/10 functioning on those meds. She was like a 100% normal person. Everything that she is doing now, which she had done in the past prior to starting her current meds, was NOT PRESENT AT ALL. She was living a normal life. So it's very disheartening to see this happen.\n\nThank you all for reading. I'm happy to clarify anything in the comments. I'm just a husband and father who is already  stretched thin and completely stressed out by this and I'm trying to help in any way I can.\n\nThank you for reading and for your support and advice.",

Like I’m going to die tonight or tomorrow and I’ll never see anything again. \n\nIt feels so real and I’m really sad. I’m stressed in general because I’m officiating a wedding for a family member this weekend, so I’m sure that’s contributing.\n\nI just wanted to watch this wholesome movie but my OCD is ruining it. \n\nAnyone experienced anything like this? \n\n",

The OCD says the most disturbing shit. It’s not me. No matter how much I know it’s not me, it feels so real. OCD has taken everything from me. I’m at a loss at this point. It feels like it’s never gonna get better. ",
