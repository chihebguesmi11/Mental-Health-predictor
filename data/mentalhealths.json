        "Text": "Hello friends!\n\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\n\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\n\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\n\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\n\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\n\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\n\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\n\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\n\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)\n\nStay safe out there!",

        "Text": "Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.\n\n# What do the mods do?\n\nModerators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.\n\n# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?\n\nIf you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.\n\nIf this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)\n\n# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?\n\nMod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.\n\n# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?\n\nYes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.\n\nOur team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.\n\nIf you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.\n\nNo one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.\n\nSecond, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).\n\n# How do I apply?\n\nIf you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:\n\n1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:\n   * What does mental health mean to you?\n   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?\n   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?\n2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.\n3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.\n4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.\n\nThanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",

        "Text": "Hello. I just wanna know how are lifes of people who gave up on trying to get better. Because I think I just did that too, I have bpd and no therapy really works for me, I tried dbt and cbt and both were so childish/common sense to me and made me feel physical pain and frustration everytime. At this point, I'm like 95% sure I wanna give up, even though it would mean throwing my life away. I have a bf, we've been together for more than two years and I know he is gonna leave me if I stop trying, but at this point him leaving me doesn't even concern me that much anymore (even though I really love him and he is the best and kindest and most patient person ever and I honestly never had anyone be so patient with all my issues) because therapies are so hard and not working for me (also expensive so just a waste of money). I can't really do this anymore, I'm way too tired and ignoring my diagnosis and gaslighting myself just feels so not tiring. No matter what I do, every therapy is just a cover, but it is never gonna stop the insane amount of pain I feel on daily basis and that is just not fair. I'm literally at my lowest point, please don't hate me. \n\nIs life without being treated really that bad? How are you all who decided to gave up at some point doing? Do I have a chance at still having a pretty good life without getting treatment?",

Seeing that I in my panicked state just drove on. Like an idiot. I know I should have stopped and talked with the guy, but I was running late to my jobb. I have notified the police about it and explained my side of the story. I don’t know if he even has called the police. He did seem like he could have been intoxicated at the time. \nHow do I deal with this? I keep playing it back in my head.

I began to feel odd around the beginning of last period today (in high school rn.)\n\nI can't really put this feeling into words tbh. It was like there was something behind my mind, like something wasn't quite right about me or my surroundings, skimming around the edge of my consciousness and always out of grasp. I also began having what seemed like digestive issues, began burping a lot and was always holding in a fart, not sure if that has any relation.\n\nThen suddenly abt 3-5 minutes after the halfway point of the period I began to feel scared, scenarios were flashing in my head. Then I felt like my mind spun or whirled inside my head, and a sense of absolute doom that I cant really describe burnt within me. I didn't feel like I had any difficulty breathing, but I was suddenly so terrified, my quads felt sore and tight and my brain felt like a thick soup. I also thought I felt a slight pressure in my chest but that was abt it.\n\nThen I felt like my mind got... Thrown? As if I was only physically in the room now and mentally in another dimension, but that also died down quickly. The sense of doom dwindled on and off throughout the remaining minutes randomly. Even right now, I still feel strange mentally and theres a slight pressure in my head.\n\nWas that a panic attack? I've never thought of myself as one to have them, even though I'm shy and anxious at times. Thought I was moving ahead but its like im at square 1 everytime",

I’m constantly anxious about the things I want to do because I start doubting myself before I even try. It’s like I’ve been conditioned to expect disappointment, even though these are things I really want or have worked for.\n\nI know my mom might not be doing it intentionally, but it’s been really hard to shake this feeling of doubt and constant nervousness whenever I think about the future. I don’t want to blame her completely, but I can’t help but wonder if this is why I struggle so much with anxiety.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you work through it? Any advice on how to manage this feeling and maybe communicate better with my mom about it?\n\nThanks in advance!",

This has become a huge issue recently, because my friendships have been affected by my lack of emotional depth. I once went on a date that ended up lasting 20 minutes because I came off as \"uninterested\", I  just really don't know how people want me to react to things so I end up nodding or humming to whatever is said, unfortunately, people usually take it the wrong way.\n\nI think maybe I am detaching myself from feeling things??? I don't know if that's a thing. It's not like I do it on purpose though. My therapist often asks me if I remember feeling certain emotions like anger, but I have no idea. I could only give a text book definition of what I'm supposed to feel. I also have no idea what others might feel. Is there a way to fix this? I can't really remember a time where it was different. It just makes things worse for me.\n\nThanks for the answers in advance, I wish everyone nothing but the best.",

I don't know who I am, what this is. I don't know what I like and what I want to be like. I feel such deep hatred for myself, it's fucking disgusting.",

This is obviously not entirely true, but I’m wondering to what extent it is true, what factors are at play specifically, and how subtle conditions and personality traits present. \n\nThis sounds really dumb, but basically I just want to hear what about y’all’s EARLY childhoods still stick with you on a neurological standpoint, or what’s just always been the case.\n\nI’m pretty sure I’ve had anxiety since I was born. My mom says I never stopped crying unless I was put in a car seat covered by a blanket (to simulate the womb). All throughout my childhood I was never adventurous or confident in anything. I was always terrified of everything.\n\nI find that lots of people don’t consider anxiety to be something you’re born with, which is why I find it interesting that I presented it at such a young age. \n\nIt also wigs me out that my mom was told I was going to have Down syndrome, but that turned out to not be the case. But I have had pretty intense mental health issues ever since I was a little kid, along with autism and ADHD. Neither of my parents or siblings have any of those conditions, which is somewhat unusual.\n\nI was maybe three weeks premature and had a somewhat concerning amount of time without breathing after I was born. I was also really small for an only slightly premature baby. \n\nIt’s just so odd to me. I don’t have any heavy genetic links to any of those conditions so I’d love to know what specifically caused me to be a bit “different” lol.",

I am just really struggling and back in the dark place at the moment but it seems so much worse this time and I’m not holding it together as well anymore. Just for a bit of background, it’s been a variously shitty year but most recently my father died nearly 2 months ago, there’s still no cause of death, no answers, nothing. Me and my dad didn’t have the best relationship these last few years. He had alcohol dependency and he also had his own mental health problems, which unfortunately could turn him into a different person, not a very nice one. But I still love him and I feel selfish for hurting so much over his death when our relationship was so strained and he died alone. He was 49 and dead for days in his home before he was found. I feel so guilty. But I’m feeling so many emotions right now and I’m struggling. I also have bipolar(medicated) and my depressive episodes are getting so much worse and I feel so detached for reality and I just don’t know what to do. I am a mother to a small child myself and just want to be better for her. I can’t really talk to my friends or family, not because they’re unsupportive but because I feel like I’m letting them down and burdening them. \nAnyone have any tips or suggestions? Ideally I don’t want to back to my gp as they just stuff me with more medication.\n",

        "Text": "To start this off, I will explain my mental health disorders so maybe it's easier to understand me. I am 26NB. I have autism, PTSD, generalized anxiety, depression, OCD, and with those things I have what I could only describe as symptoms. My symptoms are anxiety attacks, dermatillomania, nightmares, a sleeping disorder, sensory issues, and I get anxiety/stress rashes (so I am frequently itchy for no apparent reason).\n\nEvery year I go through 2-3 rounds of seasonal depression. Usually it is when spring becomes summer (as heat makes me feel claustrophobic), and when autumn becomes winter. The weather where I live was weirder than most years. The temperatures basically went from summer to winter (just no snow) almost overnight (lasted about two weeks), then went back to spring/summer weather, and now it is traditional autumn weather. It wasn't anything catastrophic, but even people I know who don't go through seasonal depression were like \"what's going on? The weather is being weird\".\n\nLong story short, right now I am going through a 2nd wave of sesaonal depression for autumn. This one is hitting me even harder than the first one, and it is harder to shake. It has been a fight for me to wake up before noon, and with daylight savings time, I feel like I crashed even harder. \n\nWith my autism and sensory issues, I have developped sensory issues to almost everything I own. My clothes, my plushies, my weighted blankets, my normal blankets, towels, etc. For a week almost the only thing I was able to wear was my bathrobe. Almost everything I touched made me either itchy, or physically cringe to the extent of causing me severe anxiety. \n\nI slowly started to be able to wear most of my clothes again, and things are slowly becoming more bearable, but the issues with my sleeping, anxiety, and depression, are still strong. I don't think I need my medication adjusted as this is a temporary thing and not a permanent shift. Does anyone have any advice on how to encourage myself to keep moving forward, and not just staying in bed?",

On the first day I get there 15 minutes early like they asked and instead of being called back at my appointment time, I’m left waiting an hour and 15 minutes with no communication with what’s going on until I go to the front desk. They tell me that the technician has an emergency. The next day is the same thing I’m left waiting a long time. Also, I’m not made aware of this at all but I have privacy concerns about the scanning area in the Florida location. There’s two scanners are two scanners with no doors for privacy or anything. The first day I don’t think anyone else was in the second scanner that I wasn’t on, but the second day someone was and my privacy was violated during my appointment. It would’ve been nice to know that before coming.\n\nToday I had the call with the doctor. The doctor’s name was Dr. Rodriguez. It started off bad because he was very dismissive and rather rude. He invalidated me, and told me that I catstrophize and perceive how people look at me or if someone is mad or upset with me, which is far from the truth. I felt very dismissed the whole time talking to him! He’s the reason why I lost trust in medical professionals and it’s really sad. Nobody should have to go through this and feel this way in a doctor’s appointment or an appointment with any medical/mental health professional!!!",

One of the worst parts of this is my constant inappropriate laughter that I am completely incapable of supressing no matter what.\n\nWhether it is in a social group, or perhaps in a professional setting, I nonstop chuckle to myself or at times simply burst out laughing at the smallest things possible. It's like while others have the ability to stop themselves, I'm completely incapable of controlling my emotions and getting myself not to start giggling.\n\nThis has led to some people outright labelling me as a weirdo. I'll laugh in the most out of place awkward way possible for no reason. This would be find if it weren't for the fact that this doesn't happen in situations where I am supposed to laugh and only during times where I am placed in a scenario in which it should be forbidden.\n\nThis makes me act in ways that comes off as downright mentally disturbed. I'll simply burst out laughing mid speech, or while someone is saying something to me, simply because I had the most minor thought in my head. Or perhaps someone makes a mistake and says/does something wrong by accident, even that seems to make me start laughing at them in potentially the rudest way possible which ends up hurting and provoking them.\n\nI tried pinching myself, clenching my jaw, pursing my lips, putting bad/negative thoughts into my head. Nothing works. I'll end up one way or another laughing like a hyena or with the stupidest grin on my face while everyone around me is deadpan serious.\n\nWhat can I do with this?",

I first had a delusion that my family was plotting to kill me. I was going insane for 2/3 days, did not go to my home in that time, was outside and did not sleep well. I booked a hotel room on day 2 and havent slept for ~35 hours. I did not smoke since I had that delusion, When I was at the hotel at night I decided to smoke again with a friend of mine. We was walking through the city and he got called by someone we both know (he better) that wanted to join us. I know that they rob a lot of people together, so while we were waiting for him the delusion he would rob me already started coming up. The other guy arrived and I immediately panicked a bit. I saw the guy walk towards us with a knife that later dissapeared out of nowhere, I also saw my (so called) friend rejoice till the cops that where there coincidental drive off (in my perspection). I stood up and told my friend what is this, walk with me.. he denied. I got into a store that was open and waited for someone that is my family that i’ve called to arrive to confront them. I got into his car and when we started threatening them I saw that guy holding that knife again from a distance. I’ve never seen that knife before, so thats why I don’t think that it was a hallucination. The person that picked me up said he did not see a knife. I know delusions can trigger hallucinations but how can I hallucinate of seeing a object I’ve never seen before (that type of knife). After that I talked to them and both where acting suspicious on my view, unless they kept denying that they had no intention of doing it. That friend of mine is someone I know from my mom, his mom and mine were friends our while lives. We did a lot together. After a few days my friend and his mom came to visit me and my mom to talk about this. I found him very vague, so I started believing it even more. I let him think he was safe and I am not after him because our moms were there. I asked him to come hang out with me after this and he keeps coming with excuses. I still believe he was planning to rob me, I am now waiting for the moment I encounter him. Is it possible that I am just crazy and it all was not reality but I was convinced it was because I know that things of them. There was absolutely no cause for them to do this to me but everything seemed so real. Does anyone know anything about this that could calm me and have evidance this can all be fake. Most delusions I had before lasted only a few hours at most, this one almost a month. Nothing can convince me it isnt true.\n\n",

        "Text": "I'm not too sure if this is considered self harm, i was told it was from my ex, I guess it is because in a way it's hurting my body over time.\n\nSo am 18 now, but ever since last year, I started biting the boneless part of my hand between my thumb and index finger, that web part.\n\nI'm thinking back now and it started as a stress thing with my toxic ex, and it started becoming a thing I do when ever I get stressed. But after we broke up it stopped for a while kinda, maybe once in a while but not enough to cause damage, also not enough to cause lots of damage when I started.\nThe skin just got a little thicker.\n\nBut it started again the past month, I'm thinking it might be caused from my final exams and my mind reverted to that stress reflex?\n\nBut a little on why and how it makes me feel, so like I get like a tingle when to do it on the spot, and unlike before I do it so much, about  15 to 20 times or more each hour, and it was first light but now to get that same relief of the \"tingle\" I have to bite harder and longer, I feel a since or relief but as I stop I want to bite again.\nAt thus point the spots skin is really hard and developed a thick ish layer of hard skin. Now some skin is flaking off.\nI don't want to do it but it feels like my body is sending me impulse to do it so bad and it's so hard to ignore it and not bite.\n\nWhat would you call this? \nWould it be considered self harm?\nHow would you recommend to stop it? The idea I got is to put something bitter on the spot so it makes me not want to bite but any ideas will help\n\nThanks for listening",

        "Text": "As a child, I had many traumatic events. Grown people related to my family, shamed me multiple times about things I said, the way I spoke, and made fun of me then (and kept doing that, not only them but the children too) for wearing a dress at 3 or 5 yo. I always kept the feeling of shame and many times in presence of those people I felt high anxiety and was scared that I'd be targeted by them. Then after some years, at 13 I found out I was gay, and started learning about my identity. Learning about it I came to understand that people like me are not accepted. I immediately searched \"Can being gay be healed\" one night, and getting the answer \"no\" was terrible at the time. I went to sleep crying. And since then every decision I've made was tied to the fact that I live in unaccepting spaces and that I should always prepare myself for the worst. I always kept the 'perfect child' persona, getting good grades with the idea that one day, if I tell my parents about my identity, they would more easily accept me since I made them proud in one aspect of my life. Also, in time started to push people away, so I could minimize the hurt caused to them and myself in case of not being accepted and me having to leave them or them having to disown me. This went on in high school too, I always kept people away from and was always anxious and thought people are gonna do the \"who is your crush\" convos. And they did. Overall I had terrible anxiety. Now I'm on my final year of college, in a college I hate with all my being, majoring in Computer Science, which I chose with the thought of making money faster and becoming independent faster, because I couldn't handle the thought of being closeted for any longer. Also hate the fact that I go to a bad college when I has the chance of going to a better one but back then I was confused about what to do and all that stuff so I ran out of time and had to pick something. Should've just paused for a year but then again I was under pressure to keep going and the feeling of being behind was especially intense since I couldn't stop stressing about the fact of delaying my identity. As a child I always liked singing, and wanted to go to study music in high school, and thought maybe I would do that in university too. But my family was poor and they couldn't afford to send me to a school in a different city. So I settled in the local one, studying natural sciences. I never really enjoyed anything besides the art classes we had, and studied enough so to get good grades. Overall I always went against my identity and never really had the chance of being in the spaces I wanted. Now I've hit a wall, I'm not good at anything CS related, can't see how I could even be able to get a job, and feel no incentive to continue the rest of the year to get my degree. After all, I'd be getting a degree from a college with no good reputation, which is also all the more saddening to me. I don't know what to do. I feel like I have no identity anymore and I have lost touch of who I am and I realize there are many problems to be solved mentally. I have zero confidence, I am always negative, and I can't get myself to even do anything most of the days. I have thought about going to a therapist but it's just so expensive here, and I feel terrible to get money from my family when I'm thinking about how in the future I won't be able to help them in anyway. I just find myself in a position, where all the things I feared the most, are happening to me.",

I've always worked hard for things in life - even my (questionable) english is basically 95% self-taught, since I'm not from an eng. speaking country. I've always been skilled at this - setting goals and accomplishing them. It's how I managed to get through my shitty, poor, disconnected lonely teenage years in a house I didn't belong - it's how I got my bachelors degree, and how I established my career. It's also how I managed to get an apartment, join a gym, take better care of myself, start doing the things I've always wanted to do and pursue the nerdy hobbies I've always had, etc. Nothing in my life was given to me by anyone. I don't say this to sound like a pretentious asshole, I just really had to get what little I have myself.\n\nI've worked with psychology/therapy for almost ten years now - and I'm on my way to get my neuropsych degree. I'm at peace with the fact that I can help some people here and there with my job, and leaving a positive impact in people's lives is nice - plus I got my cats at home. Life's good. However, there's one thing I've never been able to overcome: I feel alone.\n\nTotally empty. For as long as I can remember - I've felt like an alien among other human beings. I started noticing this when I lost family members in my teenage years; and it's been with me ever since.\n\nEvery social interaction I have seems transactional, superficial and fake - and I can't seem to establish any sort of real attachment to anyone, although I try and want to. Social circles seem closed off. People don't have time for me. I've tried parties, events with my interests, concerts - nothing works. Of course, nobody owes me anything - but it's just something I've noticed.\n\nI don't receive any messages or calls. Nobody asks me about anything and nobody tries to get to get to know me in any sense. If I disappeared today, I'm well aware it wouldn't be significant to anyone. People seem to do this so effortlessly and everyone around me seems so well adjusted in their friend groups and social circles - and I'm not. I'm in group chats right now where I was ignored whenever I did try to talk - and you know what's weird? I'm good at communicating. This shouldn't be happening. Yet it is. It hurts so much.\n\nI've had one romantic relationship in my life. It lasted 4 years and I did feel connected to her while it was happening - it was great. We met online and it happened in such an organic way. It was the first time I was so intimate and connected to another person. It's been 10 years since we broke up I haven't been able to establish that kind of relationship again with any other woman. I'd rather burn in hell than use a dating app and real life circumstances don't help - I don't like feeling like I'm bothering people when I'm outside, and I work home office. So, yeah - I'm locked in this cycle.\n\nIt's gotten to a boiling point. I'm waking up most days just wanting to die already. I don't even have a religion to find solace in - it's just lonely. No amount of art, manga, music, videogames, movies or whatever can fix this. I don't have any diagnosis - I used to think I had some degree of sociopathy, but I don't. I just want to talk about the shit I like and love someone, and god knows how much energy I've put into finding that - but I just can't seem to get it. What am I doing wrong? Is this all there is to life?",

        "Text": "There was a time eleven years ago when I had a family reunion to go to, when I was twelve. It was supposed to be fun, and there were people I did want to see and places I wanted to see, like riding one of the trains in the city where we would end up.\n\nProblem is that it is thousands of kilometres away. Driving there, from personal experience, would take 3 days, or 2 on a very brutal travel schedule.\n\nSo my parents had the idea to take a plane there. And I was, and even still am, aerophobic. I did mention this several times, to them, but they seemed to not realize just how serious it was. They seemed to have believed from a previous flight that I could calm down during it if I had jitters. They knew that I empirically was very aware that flying is by far the safest way you can travel, it would have been more dangerous to drive to the airport than the flight would have been.\n\nI don't know what made me have aerophobia, but I've never been okay with heights. Even a diving board into a pool, from a height of only 3 metres, is capable of making me feel petrified, and if I go to an apartment building where I am more than a few floors up, if there are any windows or balconies visible (let alone a glass elevator), I even feel like crawling on the floor just to be closer to terra firma.\n\nI don't know if it was something to do with me not being more expressive enough to show just how opposed I was to flying, but they insisted on staying with that travel method. I tend to have rather muted emotions in front of others, I can feel abysmal some days and look completely normal to others, even those who know me well.\n\nMy parents are both completely good people, who are intelligent and completely kindhearted to me and my siblings and each other, and would not have done what they did if they knew I would have had the reaction I did, and have profusely apologized for what happened once they realized the distress and complete terror that it brought on.\n\nAbout a week before the flight to the reunion, I even had some kind of strange event, a bit like a hallucination or other thing that blurs consciousness from sleep, where envisioning Satan right next to my bed following some sort of nightmare made me immediately run upstairs to the couch to try to avoid what happened, not sleeping in my bed for several days, if I slept at all. I had no idea what exactly anxiety disorders or panic attacks were at the time, but with hindsight I feel like that is what happened.\n\nAt the time we got to the airport to fly out, I tried to distract myself with whatever I could, but once it was time to board, I tried to bolt really, but the security staff at the airport and flight attendants pulled me onto the plane, and I fought them to the degree I physically could without doing something that would severely injure them like a punch to their throat, crying in a place as public as an airport departure gate and on the plane, even while knowing perfectly well they were empirically right about the safety and what kinds of things I could do once we landed over in the other city. I think that might be part of the troubles I have, knowing that empirical fact while having such a reaction I did and the way I still remember the incident this way. \n\nPart I",

Apparently, we talked pretty regularly through text after this situation and we made up? I remember absolutely none of it and only realized that i outright forgot when i was rereading our messages (due to an episode i was having where i felt like i was spiraling a bit). I also realize that some interactions i had with him recently was through the context of me… not remembering us getting close again, mentally i feel like im back to where i was before we made up and i cant shake the feeling off.\n\nThe more i think about it, i realize that a majority of my friends (ones i talked to less often than the one above) i just dont remember having conversations with this year other than like a couple of venting sessions where they came to me with issues i helped support them through. Ive been struggling with feelings of isolation and like im not a priority to the people in my life, so maybe thats it? Idk, it feels weird that i would just somehow forget a ton of memories that are pretty important and basically just forgot that my friends do communicate with me adding to my feelings of loneliness. Has anyone else ever has this happen? Is there a reason for this? \n",

When bad things happen to me and I feel terrible, it’s because everything is my fault and I’m awful.”",

That deep depression and Rollercoaster of emotional extremes is gone, or, managed at the least. \n\nI've been sad for so long that I'm scared. I don't know who I am without this. I compare it to substance abuse because it's *adjacent* this is not to diminish what people facing addiction go through but there is *some* overlap. Especially with pushing away people trying  to help you,  isolation, and always going back to the depression, needing it in a sense. Its a constant cycle.  \n\nI'm almost grieving the depression. And coming to terms with the fact that I have little by way of job prospects and skills having blown up my life and squandered any chances of going to school. I feel too old and now I'm afraid to live. I had always assumed I'd eventually *delete*\n\nI am happy that I'm improving but this sense of wanting to live is scary to someone whose never had it and, also, the emotional extremes are all I've known. So I almost feel like I can't *feel* but maybe this is how it's supposed to be. Only being sad if there's a legitimate reason to be. \n\nAnyways. Thanks for reading if you took the time. ",

I've never been in a romantic relationship before or even dated anyone my whole life. I've had friends in the past but they all either moved on, moved away or we just fell apart. I've actually struggled with making friends my whole life as well, I've only had a few good friends back in school and I was one of those who was seen as weird, so I didn't exactly have people lining up to talk to me. Quite the opposite actually I've always felt rather pushed away and excluded.\n\n These days I spend most of my time working (as does everyone I guess) and outside of that playing video games or going on walks from time to time, though the latter has been on the decline due to lack of both time and energy. I pretty much have no-one to talk to and I don't remember the last time I've even had a conversation with someone outside of work or family related stuff. I have talked to some people about this, only online though, and their responses or advice have been generally unhelpful, saying that I just need to \"get out there more\" or something along those lines. The thing is that I don't have anywhere to go, I don't know anyone at this point. I mean it's not like I don't go outside at all or something, but in terms of socializing I don't have a social circle or even a singular friend. I'm also quite introverted and I get anxiety from having to approach and make conversation with new people, but even besides that, I just feel like I don't have any options. Especially when it comes to relationships. I think that having no friends or never having had a partner at my age would be a big red flag to any potential partner, but obviously I'd have to meet someone in the first place which is the part that I'm stuck on. I've tried dating apps but I could see that it wasn't going anywhere on them and I ended up deleting my profile.\n\n I've also seen people suggesting to focus on yourself first, and I've actually done that, I've lost all my excess weight over these years and have been focusing on improving my image / self-image. But it hasn't really done anything for me outside of making me feel somewhat better about myself. Which is nice, don't get me wrong, but it really doesn't and hasn't solved my issue. All of this has just been making me feel really miserable for years now and it's like I'm stuck in this place in my life, alone, without any path forward.",

I am so exhausted of being supportive, bearing all this negativity and taking on his part of the chores, while dealing with some self-worth struggles myself (unrelated, but I struggle with getting a job and feel like it affects the way I view myself and my accomplishments). I also feel really selfish for all of this, as I know he is struggling and  really needs someone to support him. However, he doesn't want anybody else to know that he is struggling, and therefore all the support \"has\" to come from me. \n\nSorry for the long post. Does anyone have any experience with dealing with these kinds of situations? Either from his perspective or mine? How can I take care of myself while still supporting him? How can I help him help himself? How much is too much? \n\nAlso, sorry if something is unclear, but English is not my first language. ",

Not only has my eating gotten worse but I am angry. the worst part of it all is i cannot talk when I feel so angry, It sort of feels like I’m in third person and I can’t feel anything. I’m numb, I’ve endured so much pain that when I do feel something my body and mind shuts it off. I feel a lot of derealisation most of the time especially when my emotions are tampered with. when I’m in this episode (I call it) all I wanna do is be around people but at the same time everything makes me insanely angry in the moment so being so scared of hurting someone mentally or physically I isolate myself almost until the derealisation disappears but the more time goes by I realise it’s never actually gone, I just have distractions to help pass the time. But by isolating myself I tend to hurt myself. This is the only thing that takes away my undenying guilt. I can never put it into words why I feel so much guilt but it always has been this way since even the ones I loved made me feel bad about everything I do. I have always thought this way and I myself have never understood why. No one can read my mind but me, all though even I have trouble doing so somedays. My actions, my words, my personal doings is what matters to the outside world which is why I perceive myself the way I do. If I feel this way my biggest fear is that other people feel the same. Which i cannot change but the little things make an impact which is why I do what I do everyday. I will never change for anybody or anything because in life that is the dumbest thing you coulda done. You could have been somebody. really think about that.",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "I have been previously diagnosed with PTSD. I have been trying to set up sessions with a new therapist, but there were surprisingly none available that had my insurance. I found one eventually, but they couldn't start for 6 weeks. During this time, I had what I believe were very intense and gruesome intrusive thoughts involving extreme sexual and domestic abuse. I don't know what caused them as I feel fine now and have not had them since this situation. However, I had a mental breakdown at work this Tuesday (nothing work related caused it). My coworker took me to the ER which I really appreciated. I went home later, and couldn't sleep because intrusive thoughts were still there. The next morning, I decided to go to the onsite mental health clinic at my workplace because I just wanted a safe space to talk and work through these issues. \n\nI was able to get a walk in appointment, and I had called my therapist from before who was very supportive and willing to talk during this session with another in-person therapist. \n\nI mentioned that I had an image in my mind of poking the therapist's eyes out and that I was concerned. I didn't know to call it an intrusive thought. I clearly stated that I did not want to nor did I intend to act on such thoughts. I requested to be restrained because my dumbass brain thought: willingly requesting to be restrained would look better than throwing a random tantrum/rage fit in front of people I don't know. So they brought in the police to do this. I explained the situation to the best of my ability at the time, was restrained, and brought to the ER. But the police and/or the therapist/clinic filed the situation as I was making threats of physical violence to coworkers which NEVER happened. And that the hospital visit was an involuntary intake, when I had agreed to go as a voluntary visit.\n\nMy employer is now suspending me with pay. They have not said anything to me other than I have to wait for them to investigate. I am still really stressed out because I think I'm actually going to lose my job. I feel really frustrated and upset that I was trying to do what I thought was best, but it feels like people in power are heavily misconstruing the nuances of the situation and that my rights were potentially violated somewhere along the line. I really don't want to have to hire a lawyer and fight the company, as I'll probably lose because of how big the company is, and I don't have the money to do this.\n\n**Can anyone can suggest anything that might help this?**\n\nI was evaluated by the DCR not to be a threat, and I believe the police report is somewhat falsified (I understand they may not be trained to deal with mental health situations that well...). Additionally, I don't think I displayed any violent behavior, I just communicated my intrusive thoughts to a therapist in a space I felt was safe to do so. I also had my brother, sister and long-term therapist on the phone most of the time and they were witnesses to the whole situation. I feel like this should not have reached my employer, but I am not sure how duty to warn applies in this case. \n\nI am not trying to get people in trouble, I just want my job and not worry about retaliation. However, I am seriously considering finding a new job because this whole situation feels like a huge mess that I can't fix. It feels like people are labeling me as a monster with only having 1 interaction with me in 1 hour at one of the lowest, most stressful points in my life.",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "It’s hard to escape politics these days. Whether you're scrolling through social media or chatting with family at the dinner table, political divides have become more visible, sometimes even straining relationships. For many, AI companions have emerged as a refuge—a place to talk without judgment, navigate political stress, and even challenge your own biases. Some AI companions are designed to listen without pushing a specific agenda, making them feel like a breath of fresh air amid tense debates. But can AI companions truly help bridge divides, or are they just reflecting back what we already believe?\n\nWhat’s both fascinating and a bit concerning is that AI companions are often shaped by the preferences and beliefs of their users. This means they can create echo chambers without even realizing it. If you spend hours chatting about your political views with your AI companion, it may “learn” your biases and respond accordingly. For some, this can be comforting—it’s like having a friend who always understands your point of view. But for others, it could deepen divides, making it even harder to engage with different perspectives. The challenge lies in finding AI systems that encourage curiosity and understanding rather than simply mirroring what we already believe.\n\nAt the end of the day, AI companions have the potential to be powerful tools for connection and empathy—if used thoughtfully. Developers might need to take a more active role in creating AI that gently challenges our assumptions, without being overtly confrontational. Whether they become allies in healing political rifts or inadvertently deepen divides depends on how we choose to use them. For now, it’s worth asking ourselves what kind of support we really want from our AI companions—and whether they’re helping us grow or just reinforcing what we already know.",

I feel really stupid, guilty and embarrassed now. I'm scared for how my mom will react because she has a really short-temper and said that I'll go back to my public high school if I fail. She isn't in the wrong for that, I know that I'm in the wrong here. It's just that I know people will start whispering about me in school. It happens to all the kids who have to repeat a year and that scares me to shit.\n\nI need at least 60% to pass my classes and I can't even do that. In an online school, you have to be self-disciplined and I am just not that at all. If I am to repeat my grade and be put back into public high school, I quite honestly believe that I will face extreme embarrassment and shame. People tend to avoid kids who repeat grades, so that will probably happen to me.\n\nI feel even worse because my mother is struggling with money and I'll just have to make her pay more if I repeat a grade. I feel like a bad person and I feel selfish for procrastinating this whole year, even though I knew what would happen. I think the two biggest things I'm worried about right now is my mother's reaction and how life will be for me if I do end up repeating that grade.",

        "Text": "Hi everyone… I know there’s not much I can do right now but I’m really struggling…\n\nSo I met my friend, let’s call her A, about a year ago online. We hit it off, and ended up dating long distance for a few months. Now, A’s mental health was not good, and she had been diagnosed with a number of conditions, including, crucially, BPD.\n\nI won’t go into too much detail, but one of her coping mechanisms was to act out in an NSFW way online, to the point where it had become an addiction. Usually she would go through a process of breaking up with me, acting out, then coming back the following day to get back together with me, however a couple of times she was just straight up unfaithful. I’m ashamed to admit that I didn’t have the self respect at the time to leave, but also I didn’t want to worsen her mental health by doing so. Around May last year, she broke up with me as she wanted to work on her mental health before getting back into a relationship, however we stayed friends.\n\nA month or two later, I came to the realisation that I far preferred remaining friends, and I didn’t want to be back in a relationship with her. This caused her a lot of hurt, which I’m really not proud of, however it needed to happen. Since then, I (at least thought) helped her heal from that, and continued to try and support her recovery as much as I could. It wasn’t easy, as she would often be very suicidal, however I did what I could. Another complication was that she was struggling to find appropriate professional help.\n\nOne of the issues that we had was that A would become extremely jealous, even to the point of feeling abandoned and suicidal, when I would spend time with my other friends, even ones I’ve known for nearly 20 years. Whilst I wouldn’t let this stop me seeing them, I would try and support her as much as possible.\n\nNow about a month ago, I went on vacation for a week to visit another long distance friend (B) of mine (albeit a much shorter distance compared to A) that I hadn’t seen since before COVID for a week. I told A about this when we first started planning it a couple months ahead of time so she had time to come to terms with it, and we were planning on A coming to visit me in the new year. However, she reacted far worse than she normally would while we were away. Whilst I couldn’t talk as much as usual while I was away, when I came back, I supported her as much as I could.\n\nHere is where I’m feeling like shit. After my visit, both me and B realised that we had feelings for each other, and after a long discussion, we decided to enter a relationship. A did not take this well at all, her mental health went very downhill and she was very suicidal, and she decided that she couldn’t stay friends any longer, because she felt I’d betrayed her, and had been leading her on (despite telling her quite clearly that I didn’t want a relationship with her). She alternated between insecurity, extreme anger and forgiveness, but also said she blamed me and B for ruining her life, and ultimately blocking/deleting me from all of the platforms we used to communicate.\n\nObviously I hope she continues in an upward trajectory (she was able to find some good, local professional help before she left), but I feel like shit for putting her in that position. I know for people with BPD that they tend to latch on to their FP, which she was open with me that I was, but I don’t know if I could’ve done anything differently, without compromising on living my life freely",

Honestly, ever since then, it has only gotten worse. I can wrap my head around most concepts, but I really can't about death.\n\n I was convinced that I was stuck in a simulation when I was around 11.

I don't understand the appeal of working so hard all the time that you are too exhausted to do the things you enjoy, and then you still can't even afford to live a decent life. There are no career paths that seem appealing to me. I truly just hate people anymore because it feels like no one has any compassion or empathy. I struggle with a lot of sensory issues due to autism, and life sometimes just feels painful to me because everything is always so bright and so loud and the smells are so intense. I hate leaving my room. I feel exhausted trying to maintain friendships let alone romantic relationships, and I've just reached a point where I don't want to try anymore. I have tried doing therapy for years and none of it helps. I have always bent over backwards to follow the rules and absorb as much knowledge as I could and care for the people close to me, and all I have ever gotten in return is abandoned when I need support the most. Then society just went and lost the plot somewhere. Greed and corruption just rule everything and if you weren't lucky enough to be born into money then the people that have money are sure as Hell gonna try their hardest to make sure you don't get it. I am tired of hurting all the time. I just don't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I never asked to be alive in the first place, so why should I want to live?!<",

        "Text": "So i missed quite a bit of school and now it’s time for me to go back but just the thought of going to school gives me anxiety and makes me feel sick to the point of crying. I cry a lot about school because I just can’t deal with it or the stress. I’m not necessarily a bad student and I can usually get good grades with enough effort. Ever since I was in elementary, I’ve been feeling this way. It’s like a cycle where I’m happy before something happens and it switches, mainly because of school, and then I can’t get out of bed anymore. Then my grades start to go down throughout the year, i’ve even had a teacher say “you were doing so good, what happened?” to me before. And then I start missing school because i end up staying in bed all day crying, barely getting up to go to the bathroom or eat and i start wishing i didn’t even exist. Then i start getting behind in class because of my absences, which makes me feel worse and stay in bed longer until my parents force me to go. After going back to school for a while, i’m usually able to catch up again but then the cycle repeats. I don’t want to go to my parents help, because all they do is yell and get mad at me whenever this happens. Even though they’re not too strict, they do put some pressure on me about my grades, telling me to aim higher, which I think is stupid because they couldn’t even help me with elementary work. Another reason I hate school is because of presentations. I get extreme anxiety from them a lot of the time, as I start crying a lot uncontrollably and can’t really say anything. I remember one time a teacher told me I had to present and said “how will you be able to deal with college or university?” when I tried asking if I could do it privately. My parents also don’t know about this because I don't know how they’d react, but they probably won’t take it seriously enough. My family doesn’t really talk about personal stuff like that, so it’d be weird to bring it up. So what do you think I should do about it because I don’t want to continue living like this.\n \n(also sorry if this is kinda a mess to read, i’m not really in a good headspace right now)",

You can get through this :) I found that keeping a very stable routine and sleeping schedule helped me, because nothing out of the ordinary was going on and I felt safe.

Bi, but that doesn't matter much to me. I live in Germany, but I'm originally from the US. I speak the language basically fluently. I have a wonderful girlfriend of almost 9 years. I enjoy _thinking_ about DnD, but don't have a group to play with. I enjoy Magic The Gathering, but don't have a group to play with.  I enjoy _thinking_ about world building. I've been planning a video game for years now. But I've never written anything down or told anyone about those grand plans, for fear of being ridiculed.\n\nI'm just at this point in life where I feel like I'm just not progressing. I should have found my community by this point, but just haven't. I didn't have the greatest social life as a child, what with not really getting a chance to hang out with people outside of school and usually being voluntold by my parents what I would be doing every weekend. I was never really invited to do anything by anyone. I didn't even have phone numbers of any of my peers. God just writing this stuff makes me feel like I'm making excuses.\n\nThing is, I know _where to go_. I know _what to do_. I know _how to do it_. But every time I think about doing something I feel like an outsider, or worse an invader. Like I don't belong in this group of people who share my same interests. Even online. I just feel like I see these groups and feel like if I try to join them, I'll just be encroaching on a space I'm not allowed to be in. I've played a few MMOs in my time, and I've almost never been apart of a larger group, because conversation seems to just stop when I join.\n\nYou know that scene in movies where someone joins a big group of people having a conversation, and the conversation just evaporates? Yah, that's what happens to me. Or at least it feels like that.\n\nI almost never start conversations myself. The thought alone can make my heart race, for me to get dizzy, for my vision to fade to black, make me hear ringing in my ears. All that fun stuff.\n\nI've thought about going to the doctors for this a lot. I easily could. But every time I think about going, I talk myself out of it because \"it's not that bad\" or \"there are people that need more help than me\" or \"there are people there with _actual_ injuries and illnesses, the doctor doesn't have time for me\".\n\nI just feel a little lost and don't have any idea how to get myself out of this. \n\nMaybe I need advice? A swift kick in the pants? Idk at this point.",

With the openness of getting back together and trying things out again when the timing is right for both of us. Her rebound seems like an unstable guy, I was sent multiple videos the same day of the call of them having sex and etc from her contact #, which hurt really badly. She has expressed to me that he is someone she would not want to marry, especially the fact that I have made a really positive mark for myself as a partner to her. \n\nGiven that our past relationship was very real and strong and has depth within family and the time of the relationship, do you think it’s him that took her phone and sent these without her knowing? I texted back to see if I was blocked, and I am, so he must’ve deleted it and blocked me. Deep down I feel like he is trying to push me away, especially since her and I have a very strong bond. At the end of the day, I’m not mad at the act because she is single. Since I know her well, this isn’t something she would do, but there’s also the possibility that it was her. \n\nDoes anyone have some advice or insight on this? Does this seem like a fling? We are in our early 20’s by the way. I want to feel better about all of this. She is not someone that has done any harm to me or our relationship. Since there was nothing that was disrespected between us other than her not being honest about the intimate things she’s done, I think I would still be open to reconnecting in the future. But a large part of this is that I need to go into a long no contact period, to help myself and for her to see what value I truly have as a partner. I just feel like I need a third persons point of view. Thanks for reading. ",

The next time I looked at the mirror I was smiling. I was going back and forth between laughing and screaming sobbing. My dad was home and we don't live in a house but an apartment.

After about 2h I managed to call my dad to come into my room because I kept screaming for him to come but he ignored. Once he arrived he sighed like I was an annoyance and bothering him. It took so much courage for me to do that and he was annoyed.

When he was interviewing me about my thoughts and feelings, I felt like I couldn't tell him everything, maybe I still have to establish more rapport with him considering that I've never even talked about my thoughts and experiences to anyone, which are actually the reason that lead me to seek help. I was only able to tell superficial experiences and those that were my \"breaking points\". I'll be seeing him again after 3 weeks to see if my meds are effective. Will it be okay to take things slow during my therapy until I can finally say I'm ready to fully open up? I kind of feeling guilty for myself since I've prepared for it but I wasn't able to say all my unsaid thoughts and experiences during the first consultation. ",

My joints crack when I move suddenly, and my clothes never fit properly and i always struggle to find clothes my size.

It makes me wonder if they'll ever speak to me again if I'm ever confronted (as my also diagnosed OCD is freaking out). \n\nAnd yet, my inner self is telling me to: \"Calm, child. You own the words you said, yes, but their reactions are not for you to own. You shared your experiences. Your perspectives of what happened to you. There is no other way to phrase it. They can disagree and hate you all you want. It doesn't change the fact that you went through that in your life and you shouldn't have. Those experiences have put you here now, and taught you how to be the woman you are today.\" \n\nUgh.

        "Text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a 20-year-old college student from South Asia, and I’ve always had a sensitive stomach. About 10 months ago, I started experiencing some troubling symptoms. At that time, I used to travel by car every month to take exams, usually after a heavy meal (rice). During the journey, I often felt nauseous, but the feeling would go away once the exam started.\n\nHowever, on one particular day, an hour into my exam, I started feeling extremely unwell. I experienced nausea, dizziness, sweating, a rapid heartbeat, and body tremors, which made it impossible for me to continue the exam. Even after returning home, I couldn’t eat properly for two weeks because of constant burping and nausea. Other symptoms included stomach pain with a burning sensation, a frequent urge to eat every half hour, and an overall sense of uneasiness throughout the day.\n\nI consulted several doctors, who initially prescribed gastric and anxiety medications, suggesting I might have performance anxiety. Despite taking the medications, I didn’t see much improvement over two months. Eventually, I underwent an endoscopy, which revealed a weak lower esophageal sphincter (LES), leading to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). The doctor recommended lifestyle changes and a two-month course of PPIs (proton pump inhibitors).\n\nWhile I’m now off medication and managing GERD with lifestyle adjustments, I frequently experience an upset stomach. The bigger challenge, however, is my inability to focus on studies, especially in college. At home, I can manage to study, but at college, the anxiety becomes overwhelming. I feel nauseous whenever I try to concentrate, and having a heavy meal like rice before heading to college makes things worse.\n\nThe short travel to college after eating causes my heart rate to increase, and even after arriving, it stays elevated for 1-2 hours, accompanied by nausea and burping. I struggle the most during theory classes, where I can’t focus or take notes. Interestingly, I feel more at ease during practical classes, likely because I can move around freely.\n\nThis situation has left me feeling hopeless about my academic future. Can anyone relate to this? Would treating my anxiety help, and if so, should I consider therapy or medication? I would deeply appreciate any advice or suggestions.\n\n",

Sometimes I cry about my past self but then I don't really care, since I was 10 I think I've been aggressive? I stole my classmates' toys because I liked them and I thought I should have them too, I didn't really care what they thought. I remember one child crying because I had stolen his entire album and I remained impassive denying that I had stolen it. Now I'm not a \"thief\", because I'm not sociable, I'm sensitive and I don't think I particularly like being the center of attention, but I still want people to talk to me, or Im Just more intelligent than them and I dont deserve to talk to people like them, but I'm still very sensitive and shy. I've never been particularly sociable, antisocial? I don't know. I think I hate my partner, it's not really hate, but I would like to insult him and remind him how much he sucks, argue with him, for me it's enjoyable to think that I insult him, just like I insult anyone who I think they don't deserve to be better than me. I have a scenario where I say things to make others suffer, I would take their position, and if I could I would hack them to get as much information about them as possible. To have some fun and feel, \"special\"? I don't know. (only on people I find interesting). Then I hate my psychologist, I don't tell her anything, because I think it's stupid, I don't care what I should do with her, I think I don't need anything. Then I'm rather irritable, like I often get annoyed with my partner and immediately my mood changes, I want to insult him and treat him badly, but then it passes but idk.",

The time I turned him down for sex through text and he began to belittle til I gave in then he started calling me a slut. We didn't live together anymore so I just cried alone. Then he walks through my door suddenly. He actually showed up to have sex with me. I could barely breath. I felt like I couldn't tell him no, especially after he showed up at my place. I would pay the price for days. So I just accepted it, shaking because I was so upset but hiding it. I just silently cried in the dark. At one point, he was squeezing my neck so hard that I was getting faint. But I didn't stop him. I wanted to pass out. He noticed before I did and stopped..asking why I was crying. I just said he was hurting me. He told me I should have said something then just kept going and finished. \n\nAlmost my entire sex life with him was out of fear. Him becoming angry when I rejected him. Him making me \"pay\" for it through emotionally and verbally abuse. Manipulating me into doing it when I didn't want to. Over and over. \n\nAm I wrong? Is this ALL actually considered SA? I'm becoming so overwhelmed by this new thought process. I guess a part of me is hoping I'm viewing this wrong. ",

It's been more recurring very recently, and I've tried looking it up to understand a little more of what's going on; whether it's auditory hallucinations or not, and I'm not too sure.

She got back in the car, started speeding down the highway and continued to scream at me saying that she and my grandparents had treated me with nothing but respect. She continued on to call me a selfish child, and stupid and other things like that. I put one headphones and turned up the volume all the way so I couldn't hear her yelling at me.\nWe got home and I sat in the car with my music on full volume (enough for you by olivia rodrigo) for a solid ten minutes. I was crying my eyes out and felt like I wanted to end it right then and there When my mum came and kicked me out of the car.\n\nIf this whole situation sounds stupid, it probably is, and if that's the case sorry for wasting your time. I just need some support and I feel like this is the only safe place I can go.",

He claims he doesn't want us to be scared of life but makes is watch the videos too. I grew up not leaving the house on my own, I'm not even allowed in the front yard. So 99% of my life is in this stupid house in less my mom goes somewhere and I go with her. \nI can't take it anymore. My mental health is deteriorating because I can't hang out with friends and go places I want. I know about safety but I don't need it shoved in my face every second I exist. I'm pretty sure because of this I have anxiety now. Thanks dad!! I also asked my mom to see my therapist again and she just said what's the reason and then began ranting about how SHE is the one who needs therapy. \nI think my parents just don't care on how this life affects us and how miserable it has been. In efforts to \"protect us\" they ruined any chance of being a normal kid. I never got to have a normal childhood, I can't socialize for shit now, and I just want to move out but can't. ",

I've had a major escalation from my skip-level manager recently but I'm still unfazed. At this point of my life, my career should be of utmost importance, yet here I am behaving as if I was born into generational wealth and without a care in the world. I'll be unemployed and broke very soon if this continues. Please give me some tough love or tips to get out of this mindblock.",

My friend has been having issues with her mom recently and it also threatens her physical health. Overall, there's just been a ton of stressful shit going on.\n\nAfter a while, my mom suggests that maybe I take my sister home and that they would be back in a few hours. I explained to her that I wasn't doing too well and with the thoughts I had running through my head at the moment, it wouldn't necessarily be the best time for me to watch a rambunctious kid. My mom asked me what was going on, and I told her about my friend and the issues she's had with her mom and how I can't help but feel with her. I also said that it piles onto my shoulders along with all my schoolwork and the overarching stress and anxiety I've been having lately.\n\nAs my mother, you'd think she'd understand. But no. What did she say instead? \"First of all, get out of your room. It's going to affect your mental health. Secondly, it's not your problem. Don't worry about it.\"(For the being in my room thing, I've had some issues with getting out of there or feeling the drive to do so.)\n\nHere's my counter argument: though I try to understand from her perspective, I try to explain to her that this person is my friend and that I feel her pain. I know she knows I can be extremely sensitive to those around me, and in this case it felt pretty shitty. But then it felt like she was bashing on my opinion when she said it.\n\nHere's why it hurts. I love my mom. She's a great person. But when I tell her something, she always feels the need to interject with her opinion and it feels like she's lessening mine with it. In this scenario, all I wanted was for her to listen. I didn't want her opinion for this, and if I did, I would have asked for it. She doesn't ever take the time to think, \"Hmm, do they want my opinion? Or should I back down and just listen?\" and instead it makes me feel patronized and like my feelings ran less than her opinion.\n\nI don't really know how to tell her any of this because she can be sensitive too and I don't want to hurt my mom. But after that interaction, I felt like crying. I'm probably being irrational though. It probably wasn't as bad as I think and she was just trying to help. I don't know what to think or feel anymore. She does this all the time and I want to be able to agree with her, to have a good chat with her, but this? It just hurts. More than she knows.",

        "Text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m not sure how to put this, but I need some direction. I have no reason to be unhappy, but I am.\n\nI’m a 17-year-old high school senior applying to universities to study aerospace/mechanical engineering. I do well in school, am hardworking, and enjoy ice hockey, surfing, snowboarding, photography, and music. While I had a challenging childhood due to my parents’ divorce and living with a hostile mother, I now have a good relationship with both parents. Despite this, I can’t shake this persistent unhappiness.\n\nSocially, I struggle. People see me as outgoing and fun, and while I’ve worked to be more extroverted, I don’t have a best friend or anyone I can confide in. I recently joined a friend group for the first time, but I often feel left out or like an outsider. I have a close friend from hockey who used to feel like a brother to me, but we’ve grown apart. His ego and behavior, like being dismissive or speaking disrespectfully about his girlfriend, have made it hard to stay close to him.\n\nTalking to my parents about personal issues hasn’t been helpful. My dad can be demeaning, and his advice often makes me feel worse, even when he means well. My mom is supportive, but her advice tends to be unhelpful or even counterproductive. While I love them both, I’ve realized I can’t open up to them in the ways I need.\n\nThis leaves me feeling isolated and unsure of how to address my feelings. I feel like I’m not enough, constantly comparing myself to others and being overly hard on myself. Even small mistakes cause me to shut down. I struggle with self-doubt, feeling like a burden to those around me, and being overly self-critical. I’ve tried forming meaningful connections, but it often doesn’t work out. I haven’t had a girlfriend, and rejection based on how I look hurts deeply.\n\nOn top of this, I feel burnt out. Activities I used to enjoy, like music and photography, bring less joy than before. While I appear happy on the outside, I often feel exhausted and empty inside. The thought of missing milestones like prom because I don’t have a date makes me feel like a failure. Everyone tells me I’ll move past this phase, but it doesn’t feel that way right now.\n\nI’ve listened to advice about mindset shifts, but I need actionable steps to improve my situation. I’m scared I’ll continue falling deeper into this hole without a way out. I don’t want to come off as ungrateful because I recognize how lucky I am in many ways. However, I need help figuring out how to feel happy again.\n\nI had to use ChatGPT to shorten this (so much shame) because I wrote over 3500 characters, so if you'd like me to elaborate on anything please let me know. \n\nThank you for reading.",

The thing is, there was never a specific reason why i was so disliked, they never could tell me why. Now I believe, it has something to do with, that I am hard of hearing, wearing hearing aids and the teachers wore a microphone, that only I could hear. I remember, that some students said I get too much attention from the teachers. \n\nMaybe it’s also connected to my upbringing and family background, because my parents are very dysfunctional.\n\nNow I am thinking, why it still affects me so much. I often tried speaking about it in group therapy, but no one shares the same experiences or feelings with me. So it seems like, they all never experienced bullying or were not that affected by it. Also when I talk to others in my age now, they all seem to not relate to my feelings and my past and sometimes I even feel alienated just because of my past experiences. \n",

I won't have any reasoning, it just happens. I've already been diagnosed with mdd, anxiety and bpd but i feel like those arent the answers to why im like this. whats the actual point of trying?? i want to be gone, and ive tried but they were all unsuccesful. i hurt myself to feel something but still, its whatever. is this just normal? is this what people normally feel? i dont want to think im different if this is what everyone feels too. idk i js need help",

It frustrates me that he left to build a toy set for my little sister while I was left worrying about him for almost two days. As a 16-year-old, I expected some consideration for my feelings.\n\nWhen I tried to reach out to him, he said that I was \"so intelligent yet dumb\" because I chose to call him a few times instead of texting. I only called every 5 to 8 hours because I didn't want to bother him if he was busy, and I know he doesn’t like it when people blow up his phone. His reaction was completely disproportionate to my concern.\n\nDuring an argument, he even threatened to drag me out of the bathroom when I locked myself in to process my feelings. When I expressed how hurt I was by his absence, mentioning that I have abandonment issues from the years he was MIA, he dismissed my feelings by accusing me of guilt-tripping him.\n\nHe became angry because I called him 28 times in a row when I hadn’t heard from him. My attempts to contact him were driven by genuine concern for his safety, not to harass him. Yet, when I finally got him on the phone, he got upset, implying that I wanted him to crash or something similar.\n\nHe claimed that he was \"grown\" when I told him I was hurt by his lengthy absence and that the only explanation he gave was that he was assembling a toy kitchen set for my sister. It feels as though he forgets that he hasn't been present in my life until recently, and his behavior is triggering for me. He acts as if I should be used to his absence or that I shouldn’t care about it.\n\nI still need my father, regardless of my age. I want him to communicate with me openly. If he doesn’t know when he’ll be back, he should just say so instead of giving me a vague response. It's logical to expect someone to return within a reasonable time frame, and after 10 hours, it becomes concerning.\n\nIt’s incredibly frustrating that I can’t talk to my 36-year-old father without him yelling or getting angry. He even threatened to kick me out if I kept talking, which made me quiet down while still locked in the bathroom. He suggested that instead of calling him repeatedly, I should have texted him, saying a \"logical person\" would do that if it were important. This just adds to the feeling that my concerns are not taken seriously. He said instead of blowing up my phone I should’ve texted a logical person would’ve texted me if it was important..",

I live in the UK and it's called year 13 here.\n\nI've been feeling really depressed since like April of this year, and it's only getting worse and worse as I go into my final year. I haven't been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure that I must have depression since I think about killing myself almost every day.\n\nEssentially, my main worries are just about life after 18. I just don't see the point in living after 18 sometimes, it just seems so miserable. I'm 17 right now, and I feel like I've wasted the last few good years of my life, I've essentially done nothing since lockdown. I feel so unprepared for adulthood, I just feel like crying everyday because I'm becoming an adult soon and can't stop it. When I think of having to get a job, move out, live by myself and be responsible for myself, I just break down crying and feel like killing myself for like the 4th time that day.\n\nEveryone else in my year just seems so happy and prepared in comparison. They all have jobs, they have their driver's licence, they're applied to uni and don't seem worried at all about life post-18. Like, how are most of them not worried? After this year you lose all your friends, move to a completely different city, and are forced to start over basically... I just want to keep seeing my friends every day during break and lunch, but that just isn't possible after 18. Everyone else gets good grades, or at least works hard, they probably also have some work experience and I have 0. I just wish I had done some within the last few years, I have no qualities that an employer would want, like literally 0, I have nothing going for me. No self esteem, awful work ethic, tired, like who would hire me? How am I going to cope with a job?\n\nI barely do anything outside of school, I just doom scroll and play video games, which doesn't help but what else can I do man. I'm unmotivated, undisciplined, tired all the time because I stay up late, etc. I just want to escape reality, escape the fact that my school situation is getting worse as the backlog of work increases.\n\nI don't want my life to change, I just want to remain a kid for the rest of my life, I don't want financial independence. People say \"But if you remained a kid, you wouldn't be fully independent, you'd have to be guided on how to live your own life forever.\" but that's literally what I want. I want to be guided my whole life because I'm incapable of guiding myself.\n\nSometimes I blame my parents for not raising me to be better, to actually feel independent and ready for adulthood. I've never had to do chores, my parents let me skip homework in primary school, and lockdown completely killed what remained of my work ethic and motivation. I was honestly a harder worker in year 7 than I am now, my work ethic is getting worse not better. All of this is probably just my fault for not working hard. My relationship with my parents in general is just getting worse and worse, with me staying up at night, losing my temper with them etc. I sometimes feel like their lives would be better if I was dead, and I'm probably right to be honest. They'd mourn me for a few months, but after it all, they'd be happier.\n\nI might have ADHD too, but I'm not sure. I'm just so pathetic, life feels so hopeless right now.\n\nAnyway if you've read this whole post so far then I thank you, and I'd appreciate some advice or even just an expression of understanding.",

        "Text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 19-year-old woman, and I’ve been struggling a lot lately. For the past few months, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with work and stress. I started working full-time while managing a side business, and it’s been really hard to balance. On top of that, my relationship with my boyfriend has been tense with a lot of arguments, which makes things even harder.\n\nPhysically, I’ve been throwing up and crying when I get stressed. I’ve also started hyperventilating and often feel like I can’t breathe. My chest hurts a lot, and I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual. A week ago, I had a near-death experience, and since then, I’ve been feeling numb and constantly anxious, like something’s wrong with me.\n\nOn top of all of this, I’ve been dealing with binge eating for a long time. My mom (54) has always been obsessed with dieting and losing weight. She’d constantly switch between extreme diets and intense exercise routines, even when I was a kid. She never directly told me or my brother to eat less, but her behavior rubbed off on us, and we started binge eating together.\n\nMy mom’s attitude around food was very inconsistent. She’d offer us food, and when we’d decline, she’d get upset and say things like, “Why did you come here if you don’t want to eat?” This made food feel like a battleground, and I’ve struggled with it ever since.\n\nWhen I told her that I had been making myself throw up after binge eating, she brushed it off, saying, “All women do that to stay thin.” I know she has her own struggles with body image, but it’s hard not to internalize what she says. My dad also used to make hurtful comments about my weight, like telling me I’d gained weight, and then when I tried to lose it, he’d say I wasn’t doing enough. These mixed messages have made me really confused about food and my body.\n\nI’m thankful I moved out, but now I work full-time in the restaurant industry, and it’s made my eating habits worse. I’m binge eating almost every day. I try to cope by walking my dog, but I don’t have time, so I’ve had to leave her with my mom for a while. The cycle just feels endless—binge, feel guilty, try to restrict, binge again.\n\nOn top of everything, my mom is always criticizing her own body. She doesn’t like to look at pictures of herself or talk about her age, and I’ve internalized that fear of getting older and feeling “ugly.” I’ve also started worrying about things like cellulite, which I didn’t even care about before, but now it feels like a big deal because of her comments. I love my mom, but her constant self-criticism has affected how I see myself.\n\nI just don’t know how to break this cycle. I’m struggling with binge eating, anxiety, and body image issues. I don’t want to go back to throwing up after eating, but I don’t know how to stop this.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? I really need help and would appreciate any advice or support.\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

I know that it is in no way my responsibility to make him feel okay, but I take it very seriously to try.\n\nI‘m there for him to text or call whenever he needs me and the time difference allows it. He knows that too, and I make sure to always be kind and loving to him and tell him sweet things every day. I‘ve been ordering him food sometimes, been offering to play his favorite video games and told him if he just needed silence with me there then that‘s okay too.\n\nI‘ve also been trying to give him some gifts that make him feel loved and appreciated. I sent out a photo album of our memories together the other day and I drew him a small comic on snapchat once for example.\n\nI‘m looking for more ideas to help him feel better, like things that I can make and then gift to him right away to cheer him up. I don‘t want anything that needs to be shipped because I want it to be immediate help. I‘m looking for opinions and thoughts on what could be helpful for him, both as gifts and also any other things I can do, if there is any.\n\nAlso, I’m going to see him again in three weeks. I don‘t know if that’s of any relevance for this though. I appreciate any ideas! Thank you.",

Ever since I was brought to their country all five of us have been living in a small 2 bedroom apartment. My dad is an alcoholic with anger issues, so he stayed in 1 room. The rest of us four slept in the same cramped room. We didn't have a choice whether to have our own room or not.\n\nI always ask my mom, when are we going to move out so I don't have to live like a pig. And she always has the most annoying replies: \"I like living here\", \"there's always people who live worse than us so be grateful\", \"you know some rich people can live worse than we do\". This really makes me think she has mental problems too, because my family can move out - we have the money - but dad and mom just choose not to.\n\nAbout a year ago, my parents bought a house nearby, it was an unfinished old rusty looking house. One that kinda looks like the \"haunted houses\" in movies. My dad moved in there and the four of us still stayed in the apartment. Over the past 10 years my family couldn't get the proper living conditions for us.\n\nI honestly am so depressed about the situation I live in. The fact that I cannot bring friends over because of the looks I'll get. The fact that I cannot have a private space to do my homework, therefore drastically decreasing my grades. The fact that I will never ever have a room to express my thoughts, likes and dislikes in. The fact that I will never know how a normal family will feel like, makes me feel jealous of others.\n\nOther families don't pressure for their child to work from 14, like I did. I had to work 40 hours a week stacking frozen items, being the youngest clerk working there. Other families don't make their kids hate their lives, like me and my sister do. I know i'm still young, a teenager at that. But this whole thing has been making me hate my life, suppressing my relationships with friends, family, and love life.\n\nI just don't know what I can do anymore. I don't feel real.",

        "Text": "When i was very young, I went threw some traumatic things due to my mom being a drug addict. I.e homelessness, abuse, being displaced and other things I saw involving my sister. By the time i was 6 my mother had divorced my father, gotten AIDs, and died. My Uncle, her half brother, took guardianship and got married to a woman. As you can imagine over time, my sister and I exhibited very troubling behavior. We were brought to therapy and I was diagnosed with major depression and ADHD. Unfortunately, treating those conditions with the medications at the time, circa 1997, I think created very bad behavior, but my family thought it was simple Me, and I didn't understand either. Eventually I was surrendered to the state and again eventually emancipated. I have not ever received other diagnoses for my ADHD symptoms, possibly because I would always tell doctors, and people, I was diagnosed with adhd and depression at a young age. Fast forward to 27, I join the military and while in I go to therapy and start treating my adhd and depression with talk therapy, etc. I didn't take any meds because I didn't want to be barred from deployment if that came about. But in my last 6 months, I was certainly ready to get out and had a solid plan. So then I requested to be prescribed medication to treat my adhd and depression. It seemed fine, but upon etsing,  I felt like I was in a horror movie. I didn't recognize myself, paranoid, night terrors, major hyper vigilance. I turned to heavy Marijuana use and that created anxiety, but I knew it was amplified by Weed so I said if I can overcome this anxiety in this state,  I'll be better off down the road. I felt schizophrenic, delusional, etc. I ended up getting med boarded from the national guard 5 months after joining right off active duty. Since then I have done well for myself, by applying for and receiving maximum disability through the VA. But I have had a psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe OCD, and a therapist ask if I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia due to the intense violent thoughts I would have. It's been some time, but I began reading about C-PTSD and I don't know but I think i may have discovered a truth about myself, and a lie. The truth being I have had C-PTSD since childhood, and the lie being i never had ADHD. I'm not sure if I am the only one, but the meds must have messed with me so bad and even possibly been the cause for me being im a group home and destroying my future army career. Thank you for listening, if anyone out there may have some.insight or similar experience,please, I'd love to hear from you. Otherwise, I feel really confident in this conclusion. Especially since I don't have schizophrenia and because I don't think any adhd treatment has ever worked but made things worse. ",

I texted someone I met before and I didn’t tell them where I was, the reason to message was kinda random and there wasn’t any reason to as and that’s pretty much. I was messaging and I would feel extremely unwell whenever I’d do so. It was really bizarre, it felt like my whole life was being judged on this one act. I stopped and immediately the unwanted feeling of not feeling myself would shortly stop. I got discharged and came back, and I was still thinking about them. I ignored my higher intuition and called and we spoke. Nothing major. \n\nWe then arranged to meet. On the day, we both texted how neither of us felt it was necessary to meet. She even mentioned she felt ‘off’ and I thought back to that feeling I got back at the ward. I stopped and I could see like these two choices. I didn’t meet and I wouldn’t get them out of my mind and still be tempted. So I did. We met and overall it wasn’t great. I felt she was trying to make herself feel better about a past situation which was already handled, and I didn’t feel like there was any ‘violation’ between us. I just left it and we went out separate ways. \n\nI touched myself that night and I thought about her. But then I started to feel horrible. Hot, and like I was on a bad trip. It felt similar to the way I felt in the psych ward, but outside. I felt like I did something wrong. Then the day afterwards I sent a message saying why she wasn’t into me and just randomly saying when all of a sudden, I just felt like myself became depressed. It came over like so sudden, can’t even describe how. It was so weird because this wasn’t leading up to it like that. I haven’t been able to live my normal routine since. It’s like she’s doing something. For example, I told her my rambles and she answered back that I was harassing her. Now, it’s like my own conversations with others have this low-key harassing tone when I’m not trying! And my friends pick up on this.\n\nI can’t even feel to meditate, and it’s like they’re doing this without actually doing anything. When I go out, I see this black smoke with me, immediately starting to think it’s spiritual meaning? I know she’s got a belief in Krishna conscious but idk if that’s relevant. The way I tried to ‘done’ it felt like I was holding my breath and it was still. It was still… my deepest regret was meeting this person as I’ve had my life cycle round theirs what feels like so many years even though we’re not close. I’m still young and I’ve wasted so much sleep on this. ",

The past motnhs i have tried making myself stop eat vomit and more stuff to lose weight but i have been unable . Two days ago i went on a club with friends to drink even tho i wasnt feeling well and in the end i simply lashed out on myself. I feel like a failure in multiple ways",

Like getting in an argument and winning and looking like a better person than the other\n\n-Even when not doing anything, I will suddenly be in a place where I am so famous, in a TV interview, and say the right things and people love me\n\nIt has been like this for as long as I can remember. I've tried shaking my head whenever it happens and tell myself, \"It's not real and you are here in (current location)\" just to get myself back to reality.\n\nI feel so disgusted about always doing it. It's not something I do deliberately BUT whenever it happens, I FEEL FREAKING HAPPY! and that adds to the gross feeling.\n\nI know for sure that it's the one thing that is keeping me from doing what I want in life because whenever I start something in life, it kicks in and it becomes the reason why I'm doing my passion and not because its just what I want in life.\n\nPlease anyone help me. I am saving up to get help from therapy but it's just eating me up right now.\n\nI don't want to be like this anymore.",

I've heard this is highly accurate too. \n\nYou all at least know where I'll be when they start the next big one. I'm going to point to the pharmacy I've been going to since I was age 15, and say that this is now your problem, society. \n\nYou, and the people at Eli Lilly you always trusted without any hesitation, can figure it all out, and I will gladly crush every flower that shows up at my door under the heel of my boots with much therapeutic pleasure, because I was the coward. Yes, that's right.. me... *I was the coward who hid behind the medical and legal system with no consideration for the lives and wellbeing of others, and not the people essentially sitting adolescents in desks for 10 hours a day on a single slice of pizza who then drug up children for both better social compliance and higher profit margins when the inevitable happens.\n\nIf you disagree, then it's probably time to take your medicine. Otherwise you'd be engaging in what we call ego-syntonic behavior. We wouldn't want that. Now would we? I'm still going to take my medicine. Even if Robert F. Kennedy tries to get me off of it, or they find a permanent cure for being raised religious, I'm going to still consistently pop these benzos I was forced on (prescribed) just to prove my point. Any time I wanted off of them you only gave me more. What? You think I want off of them now that World War 3 breaks out? How convenient for you to finally start to believe me after these 15 years... maybe you were right after all and I needed them. I guess it's like they always said when going through hard times, \"Jesus saves.\"\n\nNo constitutional rights? I guess no constitutional responsibilities either. Second class citizen?

My mom used to be EXTREMELY overprotective and controlling, and we had 20+ cats in a 80m\\^2 (\\~860 sq.ft.) flat. I didn't really have dreams or plans for the future, and by all accounts was a typical \"loser\" (I don't like this word, but can't think of a better one).\n\n\n\nIn the past 8 years I've made serious progress and improved my life tremendously. I've gotten a MSc degree in the field I wanted, got a great job, moved to London last year, did a few years of therapy, resolved A TON of issues (still a long way to go), restored relationships with my family - and a lot more.\n\n\n\nObviously, this wasn't very sustainable, and my health (both physical and mental) took a huge toll. Headaches and nightmares are the most common issue now, I used to be so stressed I couldn't sleep till 5am, got stomach ulcers from overeating to cope, was crying often - and for the most part not even REALIZING I was stressed or why I was stressed.\n\nNow it's all mostly over - I want to take things slow, rest, recover, work on my hobbies, find a loving relationship, travel, and so on.\n\n\n\nBut I CAN'T. I've gotten so used to the feeling of \"putting out fires\" around me, that I forgot how to live a stable sustainable life. So now I just feel miserable most of the free time I now have. I have interests, hobbies, dreams - but everything became so painful. It's almost as if I don't allow myself to believe that I've made my life better, that it's safe now, that I'm tired and I need rest and I deserve it. \n\n\n\nImagine you went on a 2h hike, but it turned out to take 8h instead? You are extremely exhausted, you keep going just because you don't have a choice - you need to get home. It's raining, every bone and muscle in your body hurts, you got a headache because you're dehydrated now. You're way past the point of taking in the scenery, or even the dopamine from beating the challenges - you're drained and just want it to be over. And when you finally get home, you don't even feel relieved - you just lie down on the floor and stare blankly at the wall.\n\n\n\nThat's me. \n\n\n\nAnyone had a similar experience? Please share, I'd be very grateful.\n\nAnd feel free to ask me anything.",

I've since been put on medication that pretty much nullifies the mf gene and my life is much better, but before that I was a dissociated miserable mess for my entire childhood until I was 19 (a year ago)\n\nI did something bad 7 and a half years ago when I was 13 or 14 that I still feel guilty about and think about almost constantly. Multiple people in my life have told me that I'm way overreacting and that it's not that big a deal so I wanted some feedback from outside sources. I read somewhere recently that sometimes we feel guilty as a way of \"repentance\" and I think that fits me quite well.\n\nHere's what actually happened:\n\nI got my first girlfriend in highschool when I was 13 or 14 and was delighted. She was kind, awesome and funny. We broke up pretty shortly after and she never told me why. I vaguely remember thinking it was because I was too forward but we only made out with some minor touching and I was raised to VERY explicitly get consent before stuff like that. Anyways, because I was so dissaccociated and filled with embarrassment and anger at myself, when I was asked about why we broke up by people at school, I would say that we were planning on getting back together (not true obviously) which was just a weird thing to do.\n\nI have since apologized and she said she really appreciated it. I've alsonever really lied about much since because of how it reminds me of my earlier dishonesty. I've also devoted my life to becoming a therapist to help people (this isn't the motive but thinking of myself as a good person like a therapist certainly helps lessen the guilt)\n\nAnyways yeah, how do I stop hating myself for this? Its been almost 8 years and I think of it almost every night. I think I'm ready to move on, I just need some help doing so.\n\nThanks for reading, I know it's a long one. Id appreciate any help if you can give it.",

        "Text": "Hi everyone. I’m looking for advice on speaking with a healthcare professional. \nFor some background, I have struggled harshly with mental health ever since puberty. I have all of the symptoms that fall into depression disorders, which is what I have always been diagnosed with, but i know it has to be something more. \n\nI have, in my mind, what I see as severe behavioral issues. When I get worked up, it’s like my emotions completely consume me. My adrenaline sky rockets. I feel scared, enraged, devastated, and hopeless all at the same time. This leads to me crying, screaming, shaking, & hurting myself. When I’m in this state, i genuinely feel like i cannot control it and it makes me panic, because for obvious reasons I feel embarrassed of this behavior. \n\nAnybody who hasn’t seen this happen, would never believe it, because im ordinarily, quiet, reserved, kind and put together. I feel like my body is taken over when I have those episodes. Afterwards, I feel so disconnected from the “bad” feelings that it may as well have happened to another person. \n\nSo what my question is, how do get my doctors to care enough to look into something deeper than just depression? Is there key words or phrases im missing? Does anyone have a diagnosis of similar symptoms so I can ask my doctors if it something to consider? I want to get better. It’s ruining my relationships ",

I don't know if it's depression or this major not being for me, but I can't properly organize my time to do all the assigned work, and I end up procrastinating till the very end making my projects really bad. I just don't have any motivation to do anything lately. I really wish I had the passion everyone around me seems to have. I constantly feel worthless and like I'm doing much worse than everyone else around me. I feel like such a failure. There is an option of changing majors, but just the thought of having this past year wasted and disappointing my parents makes me cry hysterically. I don't even know what career I could pursue instead. I have spent so much time and money to prepare for the entrance exams and pass them, just for it to all go to waste because, after a year, I'm just too weak. \nNot only am I bad at my projects, but also I seem to have terrible social skills. I can't make friends at my uni, no matter how much I want to, because it's just so stressful for me. Everyone around have already formed groups and made many connections, while i'm stuck talking to the same 1-2 people everyday. I just feel like i'm not worth being friends with anyone there, i can't even hold a meaningful conversation, my mind goes blank whenever I try to talk to anyone new. This sucks knowing that I should be making many acquaintances since it's so useful later in my career.\nI am thinking of therapy everyday now, but I know how expensive that is, and I don't want to burden my parents with such costs. I know they could afford it, but I just don't feel like i'm even worth it. I also wouldn't want to worry them and be seen as a failure.\nI'm sorry if my paragraph is poorly written and hard to read, i'm going through a bad mental breakdown right now and I just need a space to let out my worries.

I am young, healthy, and have always had regular cycles and I did not expect my experience to be this. I feel so lonely and isolated, and like something is inherently wrong with me. I feel sad most days and struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have also grown angry and become disconnected with my body, it feels like it’s failing me. I have gained 15lbs in the process, likely from how I feel about my body and using food to self soothe/numb from the emotions. This makes the isolation worse, because I feel embarrassed for others to see my weight gain. I have been in this spiral for several months now. I do go to therapy and it is helpful, but can only do so much. Any support is welcome. ",

It’s a moderate amount of food, probably the correct amount someone my age/height/weight should be intaking. \n\nBut, when I go to eat full meals (usually around the evening) I literally feel nauseous as soon as I start eating. I do have a history of an eating disorder of feeling guilty from eating lots of food, stemming from one of my parents being very strict with what I would eat as a kid. I’ve also been a teenage girl, and I think that says enough as it is (without trying to stereotype eating disorders onto young girls).\n\nIt isn’t an issue I really see seeking a therapist for, because I’m able to get through my day-to-day life without it being a huge issue. I should mention that I also cannot eat in the mornings, no matter how much, because it makes me feel super ill. The first bit of food I can comfortably eat is probably at around 10am, sometimes earlier, sometimes later.\n\nI do have some digestive issues in the family too (an aunt has Crohn’s disease, my mother has IBS which comes with a lactose and wheat intolerance. I’m fairly sure a grandad somewhere in the family tree had diabetes). From this - I’ve noticed I personally suffer from some of the lactose and potentially gluten intolerances. Not sure if any of this is relevant but…\n\nI just wanted to know if there were other people that felt/dealt with the same or a similar thing. Let me know people think!!",

Being disabled they face a lot of challenges in terms of everyday life, from dealing with their neglectful caregiver and family member to financial struggles due to their disability. Lately they've been telling me about a lot of traumic instances of sexual abuse. I am not certain what I should do. \n\nI want to support them, but feel completely out of my depth. While I am glad they feel safe enough with me to talk about these things, I don't feel comfortable trying to counsel them like a therapist might. Overall I feel their situation would be better addressed by a professional who specializes with these things rather than myself. The things they have been telling me mentally and emotionally taxing. I don't want to them to feel betrayed or abandoned, but I am not certain how much more I can take without mentally snapping. I am not professional but can't help but feel like they're trying to use me as one. \n\nI have tried multiple times to broach the subject of finding a therpist. But every time my friend tells me capacity to get that kind of assistance is limited, due to their disability. **As they've explained it to me,** in the state of Texas disability benefits don't cover things like seeing a therapist. I have asked if they have any other options but they disability prevents them from being able to get a job, and if they did they'd loose their benefits which would be worse. Now I don't know how anything around disability works in the US let alone in different states, so it possible they could be misinformed in terms of how their benefits work and what they cover. But again I have no idea how disability works, so please correct me if I am wrong. \n\nMeanwhile they don't really have a reliable caregiver, as they pay their family member to help them, ex. getting things done around the house, cooking, cleaning, etc... but this family member is very neglectful and just takes their money without doing anything to assist them. They could report them, but choose not to as it would cause massive drama within the family, that would result in a lot of verbal abuse and/or worse.\n\nI am not sure what to do, I want to help but this feels way beyond my abilities.

They were a kid too only about 2 ish years older than me. we grew up together and to this day we are still very close. We talk pretty much everyday and even though I can't bring myself to be angry or blame them half the time being too close to them (physically) makes me feel sick. My parents marriage failed. They've been fighting for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is of them fighting and reanacting it with my siblings (lol). Over the years their fights have been getting worse, mostly on account of my mother. She has this sick idea that she can put her hands on anyone who pisses her off too much, me and my siblings included. But she's not a bad person, just deeply disturbed. My dad has been cheating for almost their entire marriage and I know first hand how unfeeling and just straight up annoying he can be so it's understandable. Only a few weeks ago did they finally agree to a divorce, but aside from the day it happened we stayed at our grandparents house for two nights and then went back home and we all still live together. they all act like nothing happened. I'm not sure what to make of us. I've been having my own issues as well. I've been an absolute idiot my whole life. My mom is super religious (Jehovah's witness) and home schooled us despite barely being qualified so she can have better control over what we learned. And I'm queer so obviously that sucked and I've been isolated my whole life and learned everything I know from the Internet.In around 2023, a bit before I graduated I had a massive panic attack out of nowhere and it pretty much ruined my life.i was so ready to get a job, move out, and be done with everything but I became a shell of a person and spent my days bedrotting for months. It was like I regressed back into a baby. Super embarrassing. I was able to pick myself back up eventually. Got a job and made friends after being a total loner almost my whole life. But it all came crashing down again. My childhood dog died and my job ghosted me until I quit. I can't even kill myself because I just don't want to. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to die either. There's nothing I can do about anything. I've been trying to get another job since I quit my old one (a year ago) but despite pretty much spamming applications anywhere and everywhere I've only gotten 2 real interviews that got me nowhere. Everytime the person who touched me gets too close to me I feel gross, Everytime I hear any loud noise outside my room, I get nervous immediately thinking my parents might be going at it again. I have somniphobia and can hardly sleep. The stress is eating me alive and I am completely powerless to it. I miss the person I used to be and fear everyday that something bad will happen again. What can be done?",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "I was with my ex-girlfriend for four months. At the beginning, everything was incredible. I felt like I was on cloud nine with her energy, affection, and the love she showered on me. \n\nHowever, as time went on, things started to unravel. Early on, I discovered that she wasn’t entirely honest with me. She told me she was a medical assistant, which I later found out was true at one point in her life. But in reality, she was unemployed, and I had no idea for how long. She opened up about her struggles, admitting she suffered from anxiety and autism. She also took medication for her anxiety, though I don’t remember the names of the prescriptions.\n\nThings seemed to improve, and our relationship progressed, but some red flags started to appear. Her apartment was often messy. On one date, I spent hours cleaning her entire place, even buying cleaning supplies to help her out. She explained that she’d previously struggled with a shopping addiction and had donated most of her clothes. At first, I believed her, but later I discovered piles of clothes hidden in her closet.\n\nAnother strange moment was her voicemail greeting—it was a clip from a movie scene, one that seemed to reflect her mood or inner thoughts. It struck me as odd, but I dismissed it.\n\nOver time, her behavior began to shift noticeably. At first, we were happy, but then she started acting unpredictably. During dinners, she would zone out, seemingly disconnected from reality. Once, she completely forgot what she ordered, asking the waitress to remind her.\n\nHer emotions became volatile. Small things irritated her, and she started having emotional breakdowns. She’d yell, curse, and scream, often venting about her traumatic past with her family. She told me her mother once called the police and had her sent to a psychiatric facility, claiming it ruined her life. That she was wrongly placed there. \n\nOver the past month, our dynamic changed drastically. We stopped going out altogether, spending weekends at her place because she said she lacked the energy to leave the house. Her sleep schedule became erratic—sometimes staying in bed all day or being awake all night. She began distancing herself emotionally, ignoring my calls and texts, and often hanging up on me mid-conversation.\n\nI tried to address our relationship, asking if she was happy or if we could work things out. She avoided these discussions, often changing her voice to a childlike tone and steering the conversation elsewhere.\n\nThe final straw came last night. I was asleep at her place when my mom called, trying to reach me for hours because she was locked out of her home. My mom even called my girlfriend, who didn’t answer. When I woke up and saw the missed calls, I rushed to leave and help my mom. My girlfriend stopped me, asking where I was going, then told me to never speak to her again.\n\nThis morning, she broke up with me via text. I tried to express my emotions, but she dismissed me. Then, unexpectedly, the police showed up at my house. They said someone had reported a medical emergency at my address, claiming someone was having a heart attack. The number was anonymous, but I’m almost certain it was her.\n\nLater, family friends in law enforcement confirmed that she had been sent to a psychiatric facility in the past and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nNow, I’m left feeling deceived and heartbroken, like the entire relationship was built on lies.

        "Text": "Please know that I write it while knowing that women and LGBTQ+ people have many issues. I don't diminish it.\n\n  \n  \nI've no idea how I can feel good about being a man. I go to the therapy, and this is one of the main topics we try to work through.  I'm crying while writing it, so I would really appreciate kindness in the comments, if possible.\n\n\n\nWhen I was a child, many negative events happened - I was beaten and berated by kids, many of them girls. With almost no reaction from the adults, especially my mom. I was consantly told not to hit girls, even when they hit me. I was told to always be delicate around them, when the same treatment did not extend to me. My mom made me work for her multiple times when I was still a small kid, when my two sisters were allowed to go to parties and not help me. I was told many times, directly and indirectly, that I am a lesser person for not being strong, for being emotional, for crying. My mom also berated my dad, always lessening his problems, and criticizing him for every small mistake. She did not accept my dad having emotions like saddness and feeling weak.\n\n\n\nI was molested by 3 older girls, and my mom said that I must have wanted it and she scolded me.\n\n\n\nNow, I cannot even think of many positives for being a man, maybe just not having periods and being on average stronger, and that's all it seems... all other \"positives\" seem superfluous at best. The society does not care about me. I'm expandable, worse for being a man. I was told I should commit suicide just for being a white cis male (with added 'scum' at the end). Recently at work, a person sitting next to me told me they treat all men as danger.\n\n\n\nI had a very happy relationship, but my girlfriend suddenly stopped loving me after 5 years. I did not change much, but I suddenly stopped being attractive and important to her. \n\n\n\nThere are so little spaces for men in need. I tried to read some mental health advice for men. The results written on the page were \"Men are more competetive because they are not accepted the way they are and need to prove themselves, as they are less important evolutionary\", \"Men rarely get sexualy abused\" (Which I was, and the comment also made me feel like a danger to the society again). It was also written that men are EXPANDABLE, and we are fine with sacrificing ourselves to others and we should be proud of that. I started crying after reading that.\n\n\n\nI'm especially scared and not accepting about sexual matters recently - I feel like no matter what I do, I will never be as attractive to a woman as a woman is for men. I am afraid that my sexual abilities are constantly judged by girls, I can never just focus on the pleasure; I have to prove my worth. I feel like my orgasms are worse, less plesurable. not needed, detrimental. I feel sexually broken. I was constantly told how women's sexuality is beautiful, charming, magical, while male is destructive, dirty, pathethic.\n\n\n\nI want to feel that I am important. That I am loved. That I am not a danger, that I can accept myself just the way I am. That I don't need to constantly prove my worth by working hard, earning money, or by other actions and sacrifices. I want to feel attractive. I want to accept my sexuality and become better at feeling and receiving pleasure, so I would not be envy of female sexuality.\n\n\n\nAnd I have no freaking clue what to do or what to start with. ",

I was diagnosed with autism, add, depression and anxiety at 18. I havent hallucinated before 2024. \n\nIn october it happend twice and I have no idea why, at first this big skinny black creature ran toward me, then it stood at a distance, waving. Then the 2nd time it stalked me, I walk past an apartment building and it telefontid into every window I walked passed, staring at me. I tried to seek help for this but got denied as 1, Im not that bad off and 2, I should seek care in some other city instead.  \n\nI have other issues but this is the main one right now, and I have talked about this before but I have a theory that the physical world is not real and that this is a dream my soul is in as my real body is in a coma somewhere, when I die I will return to my real body and wake up. At times I feel like the hallucinations are just hallucinations and have no meaning, other times I have this \"realization\" that its not a hallucination, but a creature or demon from the real world attemting to clmfort me ans \"wake me up\", that its just here to tell me that its gonna be okay, I will wake up in my real body soon. \n\nI did blood tests and apparently Im physically pretty healthy, this would be a good thing, bur its a bit concerning to me. I was like 90 procent sure the hallucinations where due to malnutrition. They arent, this means (at least to me) that they are in fact real, that they are trying to tell me something, that this creature wants to help and wake me up. \n\nI talked about this to a nurse over the phone yesterday and she started saying I need to go to the psych ward. I hate the psych ward, I was there at 18 becuse I tried to hurt myself (multiple times) and it was terrible. Also, just so we are clear, I dont have any intention to harm myself at the moment or any time soon. I didnt have any such intent yesterday either.\n\nI dont think I have any mental illness thats cuasing this issue, I think its either a physical problem or just real. \n\nI feel bad for making the nurse worry and I know Im gonna have to try to seek help in a different city, becuse every medical proffesional I talk to keeps saying I need a proper evaluation. Im gonna try to send a \"care request\" to a different city and see what they say.  \n\nI dont have any family history of these issues, I dont do drugs and I dont drink alcohol. \n\nSometimes I think that the medical proffesionals are just trying to stop me from realizing the truth. Like, in a dream, when the dream tries to stop you from gaining control and waking up, it doesnt want you to know youre dreaming. I feel that way about doctors and such lately, that they want to hold me back and stop me from realizing the truth. They want to keep my soul trapped. \n\nI dont know how to say it without sounding wierd. Im sorry. \n\nI also have this other theory that everyone on the planet id already dead (from covid) and we are soul still stuck in the space between earth and afterlife as we havent realized or moved on.

        "Text": "Well, what can I say… I, now f28, have always been difficult. I was the kid with the bad looks and the bad attitude and the inability to regulate her emotions. I was a mix of all the worst traits. I looked like someone that you just want to slap in the face - you know, the mouth-always-open/no jawline/crooked teeth/slouched shoulders/greasy hair kid. I was loud, had no concept of boundaries or social skills that were appropriate for my age, and none of the adults in my life wanted to spend the time it would have taken to work on those issues. I was a pain in the ass and I had not enough potential to be worth anyone’s energy.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, those issues continued into my teenage years. I was bullied and avoided in school for my bad looks, and the nicer kids that didn’t care about that stayed away from me because I had a terrible attitude. At that point, all I had learned was that adults only existed to make life difficult - I was unable to accept discipline, consequences of my own actions. I constantly got into arguments and fights and multiple times I ran out of class and just slammed the door behind me. I was a fucking joke, everyone knew my existence was of the lowest kind and not to put up with me. Being friends with me was social suicide. Basically, take the personality of your average teenage movie antagonist/rebel, but rather than an edgy and pretty person, you add that personality to a severely developmentally delayed kid with a massively protruding jaw, who is 14 but looks 11 because even puberty was avoiding me.\n\nAfter school, I socially isolated myself for years. I was so ashamed of everything, and extremely lost. I just felt so destroyed. I started university much later than everyone and I had calmed down and matured in some ways, but I still had and continue to have zero social skills. I have missed out on so much social development that I don’t even know the basic things: how to talk to people, how to message a new friend, how to ask someone to spend time together. I have tried to join a student organization and despite having no emotional outbursts or anything like that and keeping quiet almost all of the time, I have still managed to get the reputation of the difficult annoying one. The other students there are around 22 and yet I am the one too immature to put up with.\n\nThe problem is… I am intelligent enough to fully grasp that this is not what life should be like. The entire utterly pathetic nature of my whole being just crashes on me every time I am around other students. I wish my ignorance would extend far enough for me not to realize my abnormality - at least then, I could be happy.",

        "Text": "Long read.\n\nInterested in people’s thoughts on this. Because it’s something I definitely don’t understand based on everything I grasp about healthy human behavior. My adult son (20), experiences mental health problems and has for some time. He’s been to outpatient therapy, trials of many different medications, went inpatient for SI / emotional crisis, and hs gone through a month long substance abuse / mental health residential treatment program. I’m quite certain genetic influence plays a huge role in his mental health, given that his mother (my ex wife), my mother, and his grandfather (maternal side) all seem to struggle with anxiety, depressed mood, and most importantly - personality disorder features (predominantly borderline PD). Not diagnosed per se, but due to my profession, I am virtually certain about BPD and other PD symptoms in my son. We’ve always had a good relationship as father and son, until about a year ago. He started experimenting with drugs (although I don’t think heavily by any means), mostly to deal with emotional problems and anxiety (self medication). He also started to say very mean things to me, which he’d never done before. Things like “You never help me…you never cared about me…You created this problem, now you have a mentally ill son…you never got me help…you never got me help when it mattered…you’re terrible at your job (mental health)…no one cares about me…no one can help me.” He’s also called me names over the phone and over text. When this happens, I end the conversation and shut things down. He’s never done that to my face however, most likely due to a significant strength and size difference between us. He’s never physically attacked me, as that would not go over well for him at all and he knows it. But he does engage in mental and emotional abuse toward others - then when confronted, he plays the victim. \n\nAnyway, he will tear into me relentlessly every once in a while, I ignore it…and after a lot of time passes, he will randomly send me a song link...like Spotify, YouTube, etc. But no accountability for his actions whatsoever. Rarely he’ll send the word “Sorry.” Or he’ll say something like, “It’s ok if you want nothing to do with me…no one else does so it doesn’t matter” or similar. When he sends a song…It’s as if that’s his way of moving on and pretending things are fine now. Or if talking about his emotions. Meanwhile he has said he hates when his mother does that exact thing, meaning he hates when she behaves poorly and then pretends nothing happened…which is exactly what he does. I just don’t entertain it anymore. No reinforcement, no reaction, no response. \n\nIs this a generational thing? Just completely ineffective and terrible communication ability? Or is that straight mental illness along with all the other aspects of mental illness he has? Why would he think randomly sending a song after being mean is somehow meaningful or important? It’s nothing I’ve ever modeled, taught, or encouraged in any way. It’s funny how he used to be a lot like me and now he’s almost unrecognizable. To me, some of the behavior seems immature, like a much younger teenager trying to get negative attention. ",

I don't know what to do to heal using behavioral methods, and the psychiatrist suggested trying different anti-depressants (SSRI specifically). I objected at first because of the side effects of gaining weight, lower testosterone and feeling numb. But now the my mental problems are getting worse with every day passing and taking medications seems now like the only way to stop that mental torture, and start putting more effort and work into the academic and professional, practical stuff since working hard is providing me a direction and a sense of value. \n\nI just want to know if it is worth it to take medication for my issues or not to numb my emotional side to some extent so that I can keep studying and being productive?",

Things had been rocky since I was pressured into a marriage earlier over the summer. I was 17, and the guy was 27. I hated him and eventually told my parents how I felt, but they didn’t listen. I still blame myself for saying yes in the first place.\n\nThat night, my dad found out I had been talking to someone else (let’s call him “SM”), who was on the phone with me when the incident happened. My dad was livid. I got the worst beating of my life—he broke my nose, threatened to stab me, and almost strangled me to death. I begged my mom and younger brother to help, but they just stood there saying I deserved it. I thought I was going to die.\n\nHe took my phone and threw me out of the house. I was 18 by then and didn’t know what to do. I was only able to grab my purse and a trash bag of clothes and just walked around the neighborhood. My parents sent my brother to follow me and tell the neighbors I was crazy.  Luckily, SM heard at least some of what happened through my airpods and called the police. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of wandering, I finally heard sirens. The police got my phone back and arrested my dad. I went to the ER, where I met up with SM, and afterward, we went to his place.\n\nThat’s when I first met his mom. Imagine your son coming home at 4 AM with a beaten-up, crooked-nosed girl covered in blood—what a first impression, lol. I stayed the night and went to a “trusted” family friend’s place the next morning. Don’t feel like going into detail but basically they turned out not to be so “trusted” and tried to force me back to my parents. Eventually, I got an apartment, lived there for a while, and when I ran out of money, SM paid for my living expenses.\n\nFast forward—I just turned 19 in October, and SM turns 19 in March. We’re happily married now (yes, I know we’re young, haha). We live with his mom, and I couldn’t be happier. I’m so grateful to them and owe them everything.\n\nBut I’m still struggling. It feels like no time has passed since that night. I know my family wronged me, but I can’t fully accept it. I haven’t gotten an apology, yet I miss them so much. I replay good memories of them in my head, trying to believe they’re different. I know I need therapy, but I’m scared to let go. Sometimes I think if I weren’t married to SM, I’d have gone back and endured the abuse just to stay connected to them. Maybe because I don’t wanna lose touch with my little sister and baby brother.\n\nI don’t know what to do with these thoughts, so here I am, dumping them out. I’m not even sure if I’m looking for advice.\n\nTLDR:\nMy abusive dad kicked me out a year ago, but I’m still very traumatized and struggling to accept what happened.",

My son is 15 and I love him a lot, I've worked really hard to provide a better life for him than I had growing up. But at different times I feel myself resenting him for the things that he's able to enjoy but I never got to. And it's really counterintuitive because I'm the one working so hard to provide these opportunities for him. My parents got divorced when I was 10 years old and I didn't see my dad again until I was 27, and when I was 14 my mom abandoned me and my older brother who was 15 at the time. We went to school one day and just never came back. Luckily she took our younger sister with her.\n\nMy childhood ended abruptly and I promised myself I would never put my kids through that, but I find myself comparing my son to how I was at his age. When I see him enjoying different moments instead of being happy, I find myself mourning my childhood and the experiences I missed out on. I try really hard to hide it, but I know it comes through from time to time. And I know that two things can be true at the same time, that I can be sad about what I lost. But be happy for my kids now, but I don't know how to process those feelings at the same time\n. ",

        "Text": "Hi Everyone, unfortunately this year I’ve been suffering debilitating anxiety. I’m wondering if it’s hormone related? But anyway, my anxiety is insufferable, makes me think of the worst case scenario and makes me feel debilitated. Now my anxiety is turning into “someone is doing this” or “I’m going to be in trouble because xyz is thinking ___” or “xyz is planning ___”. I know these thoughts are irrational, but minutely possible, they cause me a lot of dismay. \n\nMy question is, what is the difference between severe anxiety thoughts (like listed above) vs paranoia?  Am I learning more towards being paranoid because I’m coming up with these theories in my head about what is happening even though it is extremely unlikely? \n\nMy mind literally jumps from one anxious thing to the next. One minute it’s that feeling of “dread” over something, once I find out that is resolved it immediately goes to the next “dread” scenario. It’s awful.\n\nI’m talking with my Dr next week, I’m hoping she can start me on something that can help with this. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? \nThanks everyone. ",

        "Text": "Anyone else not kinda disturbed at the idea that essentially the main way of meeting people now in this current generation is decided by algorithms and all online? It's pretty clear that people are waking up to the fact that dating apps aren't built to actually connect people but to cast aside most people and near force them (statistically more men) to pay to get any decent results. So many people are very unhappy and burnt out, myself included. I say this as someone who has both been \"successful\" and met a partner as well as someone who can barely get a date in months. I genuinely think at this point from listening to my friends, hearing anecdotally from strangers, reading into it on the internet, my own experiences, countless video essays and finally the many topics on reddit i believe these apps need to be heavily restricted and or/banned. I think they've done more harm than good at this point, people were never supposed to be melted down to a single picture to be swiped left or right...at least not as the main way to meet someone. Of course not all apps are built the same but i think the main offender leading the charge is definitely Tinder. The idea that meeting someone through friends, activities or a third space is so alien now is incredibly depressing. I don't assume anything will really change from this post but i do feel somewhat hopeful that the wind is changing. I just hope that we can all kind of get back to how things once were or at least are able to get more people out in the real world.\n\nDefinitely open to any thoughts, experiences or ideas people have about this.",

        "Text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI expierenced my first night terror last night and I just have to vent since I have been feeling stress, fear and mental fatigue ever since I woke up. I am very confused since everything in my life has been going pretty well the last few months and I have never expierenced anything like this before.\n\nWhen I went to bed last night I started hearing voices in my head which was very weird since I had never expierenced that before but I could shut it off and fell asleep really quickly. The first dream I had was with my ex stepdad and we were in waterpark very close to my home which I have been to multiple times in my life. The only thing that was very off putting was the fact that all the slides were very different and didn't seem to make any sense. For example one of the slides my stepdad went on just ended with him dropping in a bottemless pit. This dream was not that bad but I can still remember.\n\nAfter that dream a new one started. I remember being in a house alone at night. It was a very big villa surrounded by woods and I could see shadows walking around the house and also on the outside through the windows. I started hearing voices again and got really scared in my dream. This made me wake up. When I woke up the real terrors began though. It was like I was still sleeping and nothing felt normal. I was laying on my side and was sweating a lot, but when I looked at the end of my bed I saw a person standing there. Not a shadow but an actual person with pale skin. I can't remember any other features but it scared the crap out of me and I screamed and looked away, but when I looked back the person was gone. After this I started hearing voices again and I had a feeling I was going insane. I remember calling my roommate for help and after a while my roommate responded by saying that everything was okay and if he could do something for me. When I looked up to respond no one was there. I don't even know if I was actually calling for help or if that was also a part of the dream/hallucination.   \n  \nAfter this I actually woke up since everything stopped and when I looked on the clock for the time I realized I had only been sleeping for two hours. This really messed me up and I was very afraid to go back to sleep. I haven't felt such fear since I was a child. When I fell asleep again nothing happened and I had no more nightmares or voices in my head. Only thing that persisted the next day was the fear and a feeling of stress. I know for a fact that I can't recall everything that happened in my dreams or after waking up since it was a lot more scary than what I wrote down, but I'm actually glad I can't.\n\nSorry if this is not the place to post this but I really had to vent since I can't talk about this with anyone since I lost most of my friends in the last few years due to bad descisions.\n\n",

I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder, but through a swab with GeneSight, they recommended Wellbutrin. I weaned off the Zoloft with half my usual dosage for two weeks, and started a small dose of Wellbutrin now for a week. I never had a bad reaction to the Zoloft, but my Wellbutrin has been giving me quite the blowback. I’ve been dizzy and nauseous without an appetite for the last week, and my anxiety is definitely a little harder to manage. I’ve been taking Dramamine to counteract the dizziness, but I wanted to see if there were any other tips or advice on starting new medication. \n\nI’m talking to the psychiatrist’s nurse tomorrow to see if they find this normal, but everything I’ve read seems to line up with my symptoms. Any advice for how long this might last, or if this really isn’t the medication for me?\n\nThanks in advance❤️❤️",

But for me, every day feels like a never-ending mix of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday because of my disability.\n\nI can’t work due to my health issues. I have keratoconus and severe dry eye disease. Imagine feeling like you have sandpaper stuck in your eyes 24/7—that’s my daily reality. If I’m outside too long, it becomes unbearable. I’ve managed to make things a bit more livable at home using a humidifier and some heat, but it only goes so far. On top of that, I have nerve issues that might be connected to my dry eyes. I’ve tried Neurontin (gabapentin), which does reduce the pain somewhat, but it makes my brain feel foggy and slows me down in my daily life.\n\nI also have ADHD, specifically the kind where all the restlessness is internalized—it’s like a storm constantly raging in my mind while outwardly, you might not even notice. Combined with chronic fatigue, it makes doing even basic tasks exhausting. I hate it, but it’s out of my control.\n\nI wish I could work from home. It would give me something meaningful to do. But it feels like most of the remote jobs out there are coding-related, and I’ve tried learning to code several times over the years. I just hate it. Maybe I’d feel differently if there were an AI to do it for me, but as things stand, coding isn’t for me.\n\nI constantly feel tired, or I get tired after doing even the simplest things, and I hate it. I also have dyslexia, which makes written communication and processing information another challenge. All of this makes every day feel long and unfulfilling, even if I’m trying my best.",

I’ve always been  struggling with my mental health (self harm and ED), which was always overlooked by my Mom. Then I “lost my virginity” to an SA at 18 before college. I dropped out of a private university that everyone was proud of me for getting into during my 1st semester, which made me incur debt that I had to pay before going somewhere else. \n\nI then got in my first relationship with a man who was an addict (unbeknownst to me at the time) and eventually became abusive. I had to take 1 or 2 classes at a time because that’s all I could afford, and my parents kicked me out so I was living with my abuser and was trapped. I eventually left him and met my now husband, who I now realize is also abusive, but emotionally, and I’m pretty confident is a covert narcissist. I met him at 21 and he was 26- and now that I am 26 I would have never dated him if I had the maturity and insight that I have now. \n\nI live with him and even though I have a government job, there’s no way I could afford to live on my own because I don’t make 3x or even 2.5x the rent for even a studio apartment in my area. I’m STILL going to school, and I’m actually doing poorly. I’m so overwhelmed all of the time where at 26 years old I’ve had a stroke scare and a few weeks ago nearly had a heart attack. I’ve recently been diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD, but I can’t take my ADHD medication anymore because my heart keeps giving out- which is probably made worse by my constant stress. \n\nI feel like I’ve ruined my life and I wish I could start over. Everyone had these big dreams for me and I’ve gotten nowhere. I have no friends, no hobbies, and no idea of what I even want to do and if the field I’ve been working so hard in is even what I want to do. I have no motivation for anything and I’m too much of a coward to off myself, even though I daydream about it all of the time. I dream so much of just running away and starting over. Getting away from everything and changing my name- just me and my dog against the world. But I’m trapped here in reality where I am miserable every day- but I have no one to blame but myself. \n",

I am scared, i am confused i have stress, sleeping problems, trust issues and it feels like the list is just growing as the years go by. so i wanted to get the story of my Life out there in Hope i would feel better after and i hope i can get a few kind words out of it i really need it \n\nSo when does my story start i was like 5 i dunno preschool at that time. even then i was isolated, i was always the outcast the outsider ... only had friends that abused my trust for their laughs. anyways i can't remember that much the real shit starts when i went to school. I was still the outcast, now getting actively bullied and i still remember how often i cried because the teachers didn't do anything. Also didn't help that the teachers said i was hopeless in school because i had struggles to concentrate. All that led to me eating more to cope with my life and gaining weight. \n\n  \nas the years go by i started lying to everyone finding myself unable to trust anyone not even my parents and siblings, i talked to no one i was going crazy becoming scared of how people react so didn't ever say what bothered me the bulling got worse i went from happy to sad putting up a mask that i am happy even though i am not.\n\ni am pretty sure i would have killed myself at that time if i hadn't hag a goal. To this day I still have this goal and will not stop till i reach it because it literally saved my life.\n\nanyways back to topic soon after i found myself unable to sleep getting only around 5 to 3 hours of sleep per day. it obviously didn't make my situation better.\n\nand all this went on until i was 15 i managed to get rid of my sleeping problem and am now a lot less depressive and trying to talk people even though i am still not really able to \n\nso things are brightening up and i am satisfied with what is happening to me because i got an experience not normal kids have. or maybe i am just telling myself that so i can be satisfied about the shit that is happening to me. still things are brightening up and i am starting to look forward to the future and become more confident.\n\nnow you might think this is the end but ... no true i am better these days but many things as my sadness trust issues etc. are still there. Plus i got now a completely new Problem a recent one \n\nyou see all my life i was uncomfortable because to cope with the shit i have been through i ate a lot i am overweight i hate my body. But that's not the Problem is my gender might sound weird but i don't know what i want to be in simple words i am so confused about myself. I wanna be a girl, yet i don't feel confident enough to do that. Plus i can be happy as a boy too. is what i always tell me. i know it is not good. \n\nso one day sat down with my my parents... you would expect they would be supportive... but no they said you don't think that and that it's only your hormones. Now i am second guessing myself and what i want even though i know what i really want. plus i never trusted my parents less then now. i am in an existential crisis and i have quite literally no one to talk to. I am not allowed to let my hair grow long. i can't wear the stuff i want. i can only partly dye my hair.   Of course i have friends and siblings supporting me but they don't know about my this and again i can't seem to say what i want to. Plus the stress i have in school doesn't help either \n\nI just don't know what to do.",

Every time i saw him, he would abuse us, whether verbally or physically. He drank heavily every time I ever saw him, even now at 23, and he's going to die soon. I think the way he treated my family and I have left a negative impact. When I was 10, that was when I started desperately seeking validation and reassurance in every aspect. Its negatively impacted my relationships growing up. I have anger problems and can't control being easily upset. I was raped when I was 8 by my cousin. I like to think my family and I are very close, but we aren't. I can't love my siblings no matter what I try. It makes me uncomfortable and my mom has even called me out on how I don't show emotion to my siblings. I hate this because it feels like I can't consult with my siblings for the problems I have, none of my family knows my issues. \n\nIn high school, my grades were all A's. In college, I struggled to pass my intro classes. To make things worse, I was in a 3 year relationship that ended my 2nd year of college. The relationship was very unhealthy, I constantly needed validation and comfort, and they had no trust at all. They cheated at the end of it. I struggled that entire year until that summer. \n\nFor the first time in my life, I was truly alone, I had no friends around and was hundreds of miles from my family. I planned to kill myself. Thankfully, my mom knew I was feeling upset and called me before, and I stopped and decided to get help. I went to a doctor who said to go to get tested at a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe ADHD and dysthymia. They gave me Hydroxyzine, Adderall, and Escitalopram, and honestly it made everything far worse. The funny thing was, I was too drugged to even think to do anything anymore. I made it to the Fall semester and started therapy at my college. It helped me so much and helped manage my issues with stress, anxiety, and relationship fears. \n\nThe thing is, I never mentioned more than my dad was abusive. I didn't mention everything he did and what I went through. Maybe I should get tested for PTSD? \n\nAnyways, I started to feel healthy enough to date again and I met my now ex-girlfriend and it was incredible. We had been dating for 2 years and its been incredible. Recently we have been stressed and started bringing some of those anger issues back up. I have been going to therapy to work on this because she doesn't deserve to have someone constantly angry. A few days ago was our anniversary, and she has several people, including her dad and grandparents, dying. She has an insane workload that is always asking for more. She is not mentally okay either, and has worse trauma than I do. She is being admitted to a mental institution soon. The point is, we broke up that day so that she can focus on her health and get help. Its been devastating. I feel the issues of my past come back up and the need for reassurance that we will see each other again. \n\nThis post isn't about relationship advice, I wanted to ask if y'all think I should get more help than traditional therapy. The things from my childhood did occasionally come up in the relationship, and I would go into a depression for a few days and she would help me. I'm a PhD student and I have a promising future, but I don't feel like doing it anymore.",

The holidays are coming up my grandma died January 29th last year (three days after her birthday.) I just want to be with her. I feel in my life she was the only person who cared about me and understood me. Now she is gone, I told my boyfriend I am feeling low and am thinking of hurting myself and am going to be putting myself in a facility after my finals and should be out in time for my next semester, but he said nothing. He didn't look at me he didn't say anything he didn't comfort me, and honestly, I have no idea why I expected it. No one loves me no one cares about me. My mother told me to jump off a bridge at age 13 after pointing a g\\*n at me the year before for trying to prevent her from stabbing someone. I just fear I was born to feel like this. Alone. Unloved. Isolated. Sad. And just wishing I had the means to end it all indefinitely.  Like I said this isn't me expecting anyone to reply.

My husband died in 2022. I do have a boyfriend and we get along well and spend time together. My daughter is 5 years old and in preschool, swim, and dance lessons. I’ve struggled with mental health issues all my life. I had a really abusive and isolated childhood. I have a master’s degree. Last year, toward fall, I began spiraling into a paranoid, depressed state that gradually got worse. Nobody really helped me, but luckily some friends of my late husband took my daughter for a couple months. They actually filed for guardianship and I had to hire an attorney to get her back after 2+ months. I spent about a month inpatient in 2 mental health facilities. I’ve been home since late March, and I’ve been moving forward and going on with my life. I’m taking my medication and feel pretty good overall. I decided that I do not want to continue in therapy, which I had been doing for years upon years. It just got redundant….i don’t know how else to phrase that. \nHere’s the issue (maybe): any friends or contacts that I had, I’ve  completely ghosted. People have messaged or called me and I just don’t respond at all. I know they mean well and they were friends or at least kind acquaintances. I just don’t want to deal with any of it. I do not really know why, but I just do not want to keep up contact with anyone. Since I got home, I’ve ignored everyone in my life…. And there weren’t many people here to begin with. \nIs this ok?

It never worked, I just didn't understand the content, I get mostly c, d and E. Until pandamic where I got smarter cuz of online, I can't thank enough of the Internet. \nMy sister doesn't usually get hit since her marks was good but she get angry often. Like sometimes u don't even know the trigger and I could be like perfume, not doing the things she wants, not listening to her or just singing. She always hold grudges till now and that's the problem. \n\nShe says the same thing everytime\n'I want to kill everyone that made me suffer' and the worst thing is that if you wear perfume, accidentally stepped on her foot or talk loudly, you can be on her list. \n'i want to make people thatade me suffer suffer 3 more time' \n'I hate that bitch(mom)'\n'I want to kill her (mom) '\n'you all should have died 2 years ago', the time she planned to murder my mum and dad or suicide. She suicide in the end and failed. And started medication and psychatrist sessions. \n\nShe is selfish to the max and lazy:\n1)showering at 11pm when I want to sleep (I'm next to the toilet and she refuse to move room) \n2)not cleaning dishes after her baking or cooking (she always say Im gonna wash it later. \n3)she never clean her bathroom\n4)she never hang clothes to dry\n5)she changes plans last minute\n\nLast month she was diagnosed with mdd, but that ain't a reason to this, thinking of murder or anything. Like she doesn't even attempt. At this point I feel so unsafe and I'm moving in in 8days.\n\nIm scared for my life. I dislike my sister, like last time I feel pity and all those emotions but now I feel like she's just a bitch that calls everyone a bitch. She is do inconsiderate while we are all trying to be considerate of her cuz of her mental health, but it's unfair. I want my parents to kick her out or sent her to mental hospital for me to feel safe and for my little sister to live as my older sister now is truly a hazard. \n\nLike a friend ghosted her she can't move on and keep telling she hate her blah blah blah... \n\nWhat can I do, I can move out but is a bit unrealistic as I'm not educated in life finance  like rent, tax, bills etc etc.i do take econs so I can understand some of the word. \n\nRn I imagine my sister is planning to kill my mom. \nI mean idk man. 😭",

He started scripting the stuff for shifting, mind you he has never once mentioned shifting before.\nThough he's mentioned the character; and others.

He gets very obsessive over them and highly possessive and very upset and angry when someone mentions them, because he thinks they belong to him and he says they're his friends. He's isolated himself specifically to be with these characters from anime's or whatever because he genuinely believes they're his friends. He would cut off a friendship if someone said that the character wouldn't like him if they were in this universe. He believes he's seeing signs that he needs to go save them in another universe sometimes.\nHe's been pretending characters follow him around since he was 8, but recently it's gotten really bad, he is 17.",

After every social situation I feel like I have to reach out to the people I spent time with to check I haven't said anything bad that upset anyone or could get me in trouble. Often when in bars/pubs with friends I have to drink to have the social battery to interact with people, but find it hard to know where the limit is.\n\nA couple nights ago I went on a night out with friends, and I upset one of my friends in the group by making  jokes about two people in the group who evidently like each other as more than friends. I apologised profusely and she said she was uncomfortable with the jokes. Another friend in the group hasn't replied to me since the night (though the others in the group said I behaved fine).\n\nI know it's selfish to feel this way, but I feel very hurt and rejected. I have a real tendency to cut off people who I feel might hurt me in some way and I don't want to be like this. I feel so depressed right now though and am catastrophising thinking the group must be talking about me behind my back or that something I've said could get me in legal trouble (this is a OCD thing for me, I worry extensively about this). When I feel like this I have feelings of depression, anger and great emotional pain, which I know can't be normal.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how to handle this situation?",

It almost was the true ending for me, I used to think about ending it all on the regular. I attended many a healthcare professional. Including a good few A&E attendances. Never got me anywhere. \n\nI managed to get a firm footing back into a routine that suited me. Went back to my family home, changed job area, kept up with seeing friends and hobbies and I was clean and sober of suicidal thoughts for 4 years. I was so happy and every day felt like bliss. \n\nNow. I am back in the depths of despair. And I now know what is to blame. I'm a raging perfectionist. So many variables and complexities make up this abhorrent situation I find myself in. All pointing towards my childhood development, with probably some early adulthood experiences sprinkled in there. \n\nI burnt myself out in September. Started with chest pains and became lightheaded on my way to A&E. Thought I just needed rest which is what I gave myself and it just has not gotten better. But the longer it has gone on, the more and more sh*t I uncover. I feel I've not been well for awhile. Everything has been fake. \n\nThe life I have created. The achievements I have. The friends. The hobbies. The relationship...my beautiful fiancée. My house. My job. Everything I have built has been built upon unsustainability. On perfectionism. And now the Pandoras box has been opened I appear powerless to prevent the decay. \n\nI can't sleep. I can't do anything. I've tried so hard to overcome it but it's all consuming. The only time I have a good moment is if I try ridiculously hard to fight against the thoughts of disaster but that tires me out extremely quickly now. I forced myself to go out for a drink with my fiancée and her parents. I lasted approx 2 hours until my body was on the brink of a panic attack. \n\nI can't relax. My mind won't engage with mindfulness. My thoughts constantly race and each one is battering me. All the therapy that I've had has given me a great understanding of the problem I have. But all it has done is uncover a humongous mountain that I thought I had already scaled. \n\nI was planning a wedding, a life with kids, a fulfilling live with many a fun time to occur. Now I have nothing. No future. No hope. \n\nAll the skills I thought I had were perfectionist behaviours. Not real. Nothing to me is real. I am hollow. I don't know who I am and I don't want to be anyone other than the person I have created. But I can't be that person anymore because my body has had enough of the adrenaline fueled punishment. \n\nSo I'm well and truly f**ked. \n\nDon't really know why I am writing this but sharing my torment has stopped me from crying my eyes out. \n\nThis situation is hell on earth. I've been such a nice, hardworking person. Who's been there for everybody else other than himself. Deep down I knew my life was unsustainable but I thought my body was different. I was different. But it turns out I am not. \n\n24/7 torture. I just want it all to stop.",

I’ve gone to my school counselor, my parents, my DOCTOR, and my friends and I am still struggling because nobody is even trying to help me.\n\n\nI’ve been having stress problems and also suicidal thoughts for almost 3 years now. I’ve tried so hard to get help but every time I try to seek out help, nobody does anything about it or they just tell me it’s “normal”. \n\nI have only told one of my closest friends about my suicidal thoughts while I was crying and panicking by the way. I’ve only told people about my stress problems.\nThe first time I tried to get help was with friends, I told them how I feel and I was either responded with “Real” or some piece of genuinely shitty advice.\n\nThe second with my old school’s counselor. She calls in students at the school just to check up on them and see how they’re doing. I took this chance to get help because I was actually getting desperate, I had two panic attacks in less than a year, and I was constantly on edge and stressing. She called me in and we chatted and I told her about my stress problems. She then hands me a paper that has a bunch of coping strategies—spoiler alert— none of them worked. She tells me to come back another day and I was just fed up with her so next session I lie and tell her I’m completely fine because she just kept dismissing my actual feelings.\n\nA few months later I have a physical appointment for school at my doctors so I use the chance to tell my doctor about my problems. My doctor listened as I cried and poured my heart out about how I’ve tried to tell my counselor and my mother about how I’ve been feeling. She then asks if she can tell my mom what I said in a different room and I said she could. My mom comes out of the different room in tears. She didn’t bring that event up again. I asked her if I could get a therapist and she said she’ll look into it. I don’t have any help still. \n\nI feel like my parents know I have a little bit of an issue but they’re not taking any action to do anything. Is it because I’m not harming myself yet? Is it because I haven’t tried to unalive myself? Do people only start to care when it’s physical damage?\n\nI genuinely don’t know what to do anymore I’m terrified I don’t want to end up hurting myself.\n\nPlease—I mean PLEASE, someone please give me advice on what to do I BEG you— I’m tired.",

Also all of my friends have known me longer then this girl, so you woulda expected them to stick with me after the breakup but they stick with her. The friend that slept with her ended up taking her to formal, and all my friends went to a party with her after formal, while I was in my room because I didn't go to the dance to celebrate graduating. And they keep talking about her while I'm there, just earlier I was in a call with some friends and they bring her up so my night is instantly ruined. they don't even care about whats happened to me.\n\nAnd I've also graduated high school, with no plans. I'm not going to college/uni, I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, I have no fucking clue what I should do with my future. I don't even have the energy to think of what to do tomorrow let alone the rest of my life. I have no dreams, hobbys, ambitions, nothing to give my life some reason to continue, I just rot in my room all day.\n\ni’m a disgusting loser that will never be happy with anything, i will constantly be depressed and i will constantly be jealous and bitter of everyone else, even when i have a girlfriend i will end up ruining it because im constantly self destructing. I feel like there's a barrier that separates me from this world, making every interaction feel superficial and hollow and this disconnection is seeping into every relationship and experience i make creating a sense of profound isolation and it's like a numbing fog that dulls all of my sensations making it hard for me to feel joy, excitement or sadness even reaching out to someone seems impossible and futile\n\nI just feel like life is never gonna get better for me. Ever since I was 12 i've felt this way. I've been constantly depressed with no respite, sure maybe I'll get lucky and have a few days where I don't feel as depressed but then it goes immediatly back to feeling like shit. Why do I even bother, whats the point of all this suffering if there's no light at the end of the tunnel",

He will be like “great just ignore me”.. and it makes me feel so bad because I’m not purposefully doing so on purpose. There’s something that is happening for me to do this in almost every conversation I have. I have been wondering if it’s because most of the time we have something else going on in the background when we do talk.. so like we have the tv on and there’s music playing or people are talking and then he’s also talking to me and maybe it’s just that I can’t focus on that many things at once and my mind just goes blank. Or maybe I get overstimulated and a fight or flight response is to shut down and I literally do that. It honestly has become an issue in my relationship, my husband gets upset when it happens and catches an attitude with me. He tells me to work on it, & I tell him I’m trying to work on it or that I will work on it, and he tells me he hopes that I do because it’s really bothering him, and I really want to fix this or change this or figure out why this happens.. if you have any insight as to what I could do to help this issue, or what the problem could be like what causes this to happen..

As of the past 4 or 5 years however, I can say that I have showered less than 15 times.\n\nAt first, it was on and off when I showered, mainly based on whether or not I lived with the overly strict parent or the lenient one at the moment. Since I live with the lenient one exclusively, nothing has been getting cleaned. In recent months however, after doing deep introspection about my past, I realized that I have executive dysfunction (that I am currently in therapy for), which has caused MANY consistent failures in my life that I am only now making progress in fixing.\n\nThe main issue, is that despite my advancements in being able to somewhat control the dysfunction in two specific areas, hygiene (and many other areas) are still at zero. I noted to a friend that I have an aversion against taking showers in unclean bathrooms or bathrooms that other people regularly use, and they suggested OCD (but that's not strong enough evidence to count that in..... right?)\n\nDon't even get me started on how the act of drying off after a shower is so exhausting that it physically puts me off of cleaning myself even more.\n\n**My question is, if it's this bad, what am I supposed to do?** I did try sorta \"taking the shower out of the shower\" and just cleaning myself in my room with a warm wet towel and some body wash, but that doesn't feel effective at all, like putting a Band-Aid over a large wound. It also feels like there's just never enough water, and I can't exactly just leave my room to go put more water on the towel. There's also the issue of never having enough money to buy more body wash or other hygiene products anyway, which goes beyond showering and into areas like brushing teeth or using deodorant.\n\nDo I just keep going at it anyway until I somehow clean consistently enough for it to just randomly start working? (Executive functions willing, of course)",

If I wanted to move out, I would prolly need a professional to help me with complex stuff, social anxiety prevents me from doing more than some awkward smile or smalltalk, so I don't have the ability to present myself and don't really have irl friends except an existing one. Plans never work out no matter how hard I try and it's just a giant mess if i try to keep up with daily tasks. I don't have any normal hobbies because I can't do many things at once or all gets messed up again.\n\nI just want love but either I'm being used or not good enough. I have one friend who knows about my issues but I'm getting more socially awkward with that friend and feeling inferior next to their other friends so this is getting worse too. I'm either a loud or quiet weirdo, nothing normal and if I manage to find someone my abandonment issues mess it all up.\n\nMy teen time was taken away because I had late emotional development so was alone in school, but now it hits me really often that I never really lived and no matter how hard I try, I can't do more than basic survival stuff if I even manage to do that, and my emotions have gone crazy to a terrible extent, when I'm out of control I tend to h myself to prevent myself from h others.\n\nI don't have depression but at this point I don't think that it's worth it anymore. I won't e it myself because I'm scared of death bc I have grown up in a religious family which might have saved me because otherwise I wouldn't be alive anymore but it feels like it has no purpose anymore, I never wanted to live long anyways because I'm not living, can't imagine myself with 40 or 30 so I just wait for my death. Maybe I wasn't meant to live. I'm already showing signs of serious health stuff because I neglected my health and am scared asf to go to doctors for reasons but what if? I might only d!€ anyways and now that my development finally catches up I'm getting more self concious about that kind of life I joked about when I was younger",

        "Text": "Hello all,\n\nsorry this will be long.\n\nIm M30s. There are many past issues that keep bothering me, makes me angry, frustrated. Its affecting me daily.\n\nI was born in a foreign country, then was sent to India for college education at 18.My dad went bankrupt and had to leave due to debts.\n\nThings that bother me :-\n\n1) my diet :- We are vegetarian and my family has some restrictions on eating healthy food for dinner. I never got enough protein in my food which i believe caused me to be extremely skinny( lack of muscles) and bone structure to be small compared to most people around me. Home food is still controled by dad so i have started supplements. After discussing all this they still don't agree and not ready to make the diet better. Also im not allowed to cook my food as my parents have issue with that.\n\n2) career:- \nI was forced to dropout if my bachelors degree because my dad went bankrupt. After which he wanted me to work for him. I worked 4-5 years everyday, no weekends, no holiday, no fix timing, NO PAY, no social life.I was told i am given food, shelter and basic needs(clothes) its enough. The business had risk of life also. I thought its fine we are a family all the money is for family.\n\nThe business was running well with me handling it all alone, my dad came and did not like how my reputation was good in town. Made me stop the business and took over everything, then it failed and we shut down. \n\nNow im 27, no degree, no job, no income, no money i can use. \n\nHad to fight my way to study and got a job after 3 years at age 30. It was really hard mentally and caused social anxiety and lack of confidence.\n\nIt bothers me that I had to fight my way for education and job, as my dad wanted me to keep working for him for free all my life. He loves to have control over my life. \n\n3) home atmosphere:- \n\nmy parents and sibling are hoarders, due to financial issues we had to keep moving so most of the stuff are in boxes. 70% of everything is old stuff that no1 touches but hoarded for no reason. Wall paint is falling off. Basement has water leak into walls. Its a rented place but dad wont let us move out. \n\nevery conner of the house is filled with things. I have been fighting for 4-5 years. But they dont understand it. Some of the furniture is 40 years old but dad won't let us throw anything. Its old, broken and smells bad. I sit in my room all day (due to work from home).\n\n4) Control over finances:-\n\n I earned a lot for the family from the business but have no say in anything. I had requested to keep some money in my account for foreign country PR, my dad has enough money to give me that much. But after keeping for a while he started taking it back and made sure very less family funds come into my account. He made sure I dont get a chance to go anywhere. If i confront he would say take the money I never said no. But indirectly he does not give or takes it back. \n\nThis hurts the most.\n\n5) my dad- \n\nEverything in my life is controlled by my dad, he chose what i studied, who were my friends,\nfood I ate, city we live, type of clothes i wore, my hairstyle, spy on my laptop & phone. Everything happens the way he wants or likes. \n\nWhy dont I move out?\nBecause my parents will cut contact with me if i do, the do not understand we need it to grow and move ahead in life. I have barely any friends, no good relatives. Dads ego is too much.\n\nI want to learn to let go of all these things. Its a mental issue, all the past issues keep replaying in my head.",

Recently, I’ve noticed that I’m not showing any emotions on my face—whether I’m with family, friends, or even in class. People keep pointing it out, asking why I look so “blank” or “serious,” and it makes me feel even more awkward because I don’t know how to react.\n\nThe thing is, I do feel things on the inside—sadness, happiness, frustration—but when I try to express them, nothing comes out. No words, no changes in my tone, no facial expressions. It’s like I freeze up, and I just come across as super awkward or distant.\n\nTo give some background, I’ve always struggled with self-esteem and my mindset. I’ve had poor academic performance for a long time, which makes me feel like a failure compared to others. And if I’m being honest, I’ve also spent a lot of my life feeling jealous and ungrateful, always assuming the worst in people and their intentions. I don’t know if this negative way of thinking has anything to do with how I am now, but it’s been hard to break out of that cycle.\n\nI tried talking to my school psychologist once, but it didn’t help much—I felt too uncomfortable to open up properly. Writing this here feels easier, maybe because I’m not face-to-face with anyone. But the thought of seeking professional help again just makes me anxious, and I feel like I wouldn’t even be able to explain myself.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Could my past experiences and mindset be affecting how I express emotions now? And if so, how do I start fixing this? I feel like I’m trapped in my own head, and it’s starting to make me feel even more disconnected from people around me.\n\nThanks for reading. Any advice or insight would mean a lot.",

For a bit of context at the end of last year I had a friend stop showing any interest in our friendship. No reason just had no interest and seemed annoyed the last time we saw each other. I left the group chat as I didn't feel like a part of the group to begin with. No one reached out once I left which just made it obvious I was right with what I thought even after unfriending and unfollowing them. I found myself still checking the accounts of the ones that weren't private. It's been a shit year in term of friendships for me because they were really the only friends I had. I've tried joining groups, going to events and even bumble bff but haven't had any luck. I'm hoping it helps but I'm also worried it still won't. How have other people found it? Did anyone find that it made you feel more alone? I've been frustrated with other aspects of life as well so I'm trying to take some steps to make things better",

I’ve failed two interviews already.\n\nThere aren’t many companies around me. To get a better job, I’d have to move elsewhere, but I don’t want to. I don’t want to get stuck in the 9-to-5 trap. The job feels like a prison to me.\n\nI’m turning 24 soon. I’m still a virgin and single, my weight is just 47kg, and I have a pelvic anterior tilt while walking. I suffer from social anxiety, . I feel like girls keep their distance from me, as if I’m some monster.\n\nGirls don’t have to struggle the way I do. They get what they want just by using their bodies, while I have to fight for everything.\n\nI have two older sisters; one is mentally unstable, and my parents expect me to take care of her too. How can a person who can’t take care of himself take on others’ responsibilities?\n\nI have a stammer, and for even the most basic tasks, I need others’ help. My father doesn’t respect me and doesn’t listen to me. To him, I’m just a tool to secure his old age, and my sister is just as selfish.\n\nThe company I work for is toxic. If I don’t work late at night, I get scolded.\n\nI used to have an interest in coding in college, but over the 1.2 years of my career, I’ve lost all of that.\n\n\nI just want to disappear and go somewhere where no one knows me.\n\nI can’t leave this field because my ego is attached to it. My ego won’t allow me to quit. It keeps telling me that if I leave this field, society will laugh at me.",

At work the other day, a person, who i thought i was friends with, slapped my butt and made some really weird comments about my body.  Today talking to my boss and opening up on why it is effecting me so badly, he told me that i need to just get over it. He did add the “Not to hurt your feelings or seem insensitive…” Those words hurt so much and reminded me of my family, who told me to get over my trauma while my SH was getting worse. The person who touched my butt is being handled, but this has made my PTSD episodes worse. I was diagnosed with it from having been touched inappropriately at 6 years old, and some trauma from a dirty house, and my mother doing substances(It was rough). This situation has made me realize that i really need help from an outside source, but therapy and medication doesn’t really work well for me. What should i do? Would a service animal be good? Would it be bad? I feel like i would be taking resources from people who need it more, and i feel like even thinking about it is selfish. What do i do?",

After four years of going through life, serving, traveling and taking gig jobs, I finally land my first job in the field I studied.  \n\nAnd I loved it but found my love and passion not shared by those around me. I’d ask if they are having fun or enjoying their day and its amounted to “just work” or “just a job” . I don't understand how people who are in my dream field are wasting and taking the position from people who studied in that field. \n\nAnyway, by the time I get home from work, im mentally exhausted from masking myself in the world of office politics and unpassionate people. So, I sleep, I eat bad food. I turn on something I like to watch and I go to sleep and repeat. I self soothe and comfort. \n\nMonths later, I find myself at a new position, this now my second job in my field where I now have a mentor and all the people in  the office are certified, hold credentials or at least have their masters in this field and the environment is supportive. It seriously has me questioning as though I’m so far from my goals,that I have impostor syndrome. I find myself overwhelmed by the lack of things I actually know in my field of work due to the practical and face to face aspects of it not taught in the classroom. \n\nThis led to me beginning to resume my professional development and continue with my CE courses for more credentials and letters. I fear the guilt I may have in the future because I have spent the last 3 years hearing nothing about my field.\n\n So I sat listening to podcasts from professionals in my field so that I can learn more. I have no clue how people manage their life with mental health and professional development, career and goals?  How do you? \n\nIs it normal of someone in their career to spend time listening to podcasts and constantly reading or engaging in communities/conferences in their field? Do some just go home and leave their job at the door? And how many of those people have ture ambition in furthering their career? \n\nHow do you manage your career goals in balance with your life, your job, family and your mental health? \n\nI'm having a hard time balancing when I need to be tending to my mental health, such as watching a silly youtube vid versus studying or journaling, joining classes or networking.. Not to mention ADHD brain and having too many stimulus that its hard for you to recall or focus on subject with recollection\n\nI don't want to look back in a few years and have not met my goals because of my depression.\n",

I was diagnosed with \"Moderate to severe social anxiety\" back in high school which has caused me to have a history of self-isolation. At first I tried therapy for roughly half a year which didn't work and then I got prescribed Prozac which also didn't help. I have trouble meeting people and a majority of my past friends were met because they came up to me. I'm currently 19, when I left for college out of state at 17 I distanced myself from a majority of my friends because our lifestyles were simply too different and I figured leaving for college would be a good time to do so. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend my first semester and she introduced me to virtually all of the friends I made during my freshman year of college. I was happy. Fast forward to the middle of the semester and it was like she totally changed. After she had an encounter with her ex (I'm not sure what happened as she wouldn't tell me) She would get angry / ignore messages / yell at me whenever I would hang out with her friends instead of her even going so far as to say \"I wish I never introduced them to you\". We were on and off for the rest of the semester / following semester and my grades suffered during the entirety of that process. My final semester of my freshman year I decided a 4-year private university wasn't worth attending if my grades weren't up to par. Before I left, I already knew I wouldn't see or talk to any of the friends I made at that school again because they would still be connected to her.\n\nCurrently, I work part-time while attending Community College full time (all online classes with one virtual class thank god). I talk to none of my friends from High School, all of my coworkers are significantly older than me with wives / children of their own so I don't talk to any of them outside of work. Outside of work and school, I can't even remember what I do in my free time, I wouldn't say I'm sad but I just feel empty and I don't know how much longer I can put up with that feeling. I recently started paying car insurance under my parents insurance company so I'll be able to legally drive by myself once I buy new tires for the winter . I enjoy photography and sometimes attend car meets / sporting events though I don't talk to anyone there unless they come up to me first.\n\nI'm asking for help here because I feel like I have no one to ask in my personal life.\n\nWhat can I do to improve.\n\nHow can I learn to stop self-isolating.\n\nWhere can I meet / connect with people.\n\nHas anyone found an alternative to help with anxiety outside of therapy / medication?\n\nThank you.",

I've started hearing voices, most of the time they are harmless, but there was this 1 time when it told me to kill \"them\", whoever \"them\" is. And I've started to have bad dissosiatve episodes. I have gaps in my memory, and when I do remember things, there's a chance that that memory was just a dream. I can't seem to read or talk anymore. It's really hard for me to read, and I say things backwards/mixed up all the time. I even created a survival backpack in case I need to go off the grid for a while, and I had a episode that I lived in a post-apocalyptic world, because the president did a crap ton of things that seriously screwed up our society and caused basically World War 3. It was so severe it made me clean my digital footprint so you couldn't track me online. I even deleted important pictures from my cell phone so I wouldn't have anything that couldn't incriminate me, even though they were just photos and videos about things that I saw online and wanted to watch later so I saved it to my photo album app. \n\nAnd now I'm scared of a spray bottle because its reflection moved closer to me despite the bottle not moving closer IRL, just the reflection. The mirror glitched for a second and now I'm scared the spray bottle is going to kill me when I sleep and I'm tearing up now. \n\nMy mental health is so bad that I've skipped school a few times, and when I do go to school, I don't get anything done because I zone out/get into a daze and stop mentally existing till something brings me back. But my parents and therapist won't let me get meds because they want to do a mental evaluation so we know what I have, but they want me to finish school first. I can't wait that long. I'm hitting rock bottom NOW! \n\n***I'm scared and don't know what to do anymore.*** ",

        "Text": "Does anyone here have high expectations when it comes to helping others out.; and being with them IN PERSON, not over the phone or via FaceTime?  I am also Autistic. \n\nMany of the stupid things that I did since I was a kid were when I was alone.  I'm 31 right now and feel like not very much has changed in that respect. \n\nWhen I was seven years old, I remember hitting a neighbors dog (it was a Corgi or some other small breed) with a baseball bat.  In perspective, had someone sat down with me and played a video game or even just invited me to watch them play a game, I wouldn't have hit the dog. \n\nTwo adult examples include me wishing I friend with me in person, who would've gone as far as physically restraining me before I ended up driving a car worth around $40K into a ditch (this happened two years ago); nobody was hurt, however it was across a fairly busy side walk. The car was totaled.   I have not had a car nearly two years now.   \n  \nShortly before the crash, I drove into a nearby neighborhood and drove back to my house. I was in a bad mood, tired, dehydrated, and unsure of where I wanted to go. I do not smoke or drink.  I have epilepsy and am not a good driver. I spend around $500 on Ubers (I do not go out at all and use them for work and doctors appointments). Public transportation from where I live to go to work has less than optimal timing and I would still need to Uber home. \n\nThe second, adult example wanted to rent out my house for a year, though I signed a contract to have a lease on an apartment that cost around $1300 per month. It didn't occur to me that somebody*, should sign a lease  to rent out my hour prior to me moving into the apartment.*   \n  \nAlso, the apartment sucked, the indoor locks frequently got jammed and glass shower door collapsed when I was closing it. It took more than more than a month for them to give me a replacement. Thankfully, my genitals weren't cut (I had suffered 100 minor cuts and used so many aids),. Thankfully my cat was at my house which is thankfully paid off (I inherited it from my parents). I ended up going to the ER for advice and took a shower at a friends house.   \n  \nOne the bright side of things, a family friend who is a social worker, crafted a document that I presented to the landlord, which let me move out without having to pay thee early move out fee. The landlord was also very cooperative in getting the right document forwarded to the property manager.  I also have a well paying job with great insurance. However, I have epilepsy and take 3x anti-seizure medications and one of them is a controlled substance. Thankfully it's been more than a year that I was seizure free. \n\nI want to have a years worth of savings in my bank account and avoid taking a loan on a used car.  I have a good job, though my financial situation, doesn't play well with getting a new car (unless it's a beater with a heater), If shi\\* ever hits the fan, I'll probably be financially screwed unless I sell my house.  Please share your own stories. and or any advice. \n\nAs PER RULE #9, I will NOT accept anything regarding a GoFundMe or other donation service. ",

        "Text": "Cross posting from r/advice\n\nSo, apologies in advance for the length and any typos, as I'm on my phone. I have two sons, 13 and 9. Their father and I separated when they were 7 and 3 in 2019. Both boys are amazingly intelligent and physically healthy, but also have emotional trauma from the separation and are possibly dealing with ADHD or OCD or both. Their father is diagnosed with OCD and I am diagnosed with ADHD. \n\nMY 13yo has gone from being a straight A student prior to middle school, to failing multiple classes due to lack of completing assignments as a 6th and now 7th grader. My youngest has been begging to get therapy since he learned that it exists, but my oldest is not having any of it. I have scheduled for my youngest to begin therapy, and scheduled a psychological eval for my oldest to screen for either of the above mentioned issues and any others he might have, but did not schedule him to begin talk therapy. His father is adamant that he get some sort of mental health intervention before his evaluation in early January.\n\n I feel that getting him evaluated, which requires an intake appt and then a 3 hour long interview/ screening process, and going from there is the best idea. Then we can use the evaluation to base our decisions on if he should be forced into therapy, especially since it may lead him to being treated medicinally for any of the conditions he may have, which might help him feel more amenable to the idea after starting. For example, if he has ADHD some of his anxiety and depression may be stemming from that, and once treated with medication may ease those symptoms, making him feel less anxiety in general and specifically about getting treatment.\n\nIt may not change his mind, but I would rather not force him without exhausting all other possibilities and being certain it is necessary to do so, like his mental stability speaking. I've tried explaining to his father that forcing therapy at such an age can be unproductive at best and dangerous at worst. I had a traumatic childhood that included forced therapy around the same age, and many experiences within the mental health world since that lead me to believe it is better to put more effort into connecting with him at home than to force this on him. What would you guys do?",

        "Text": "So me and my mom sell stuff from catalogs and  such and we usually sell to these people across the streets who run a restaurant, one of them is a man in his (I assume) 40s who waits on the tables and the other day I was collecting some money he owed me. He made what I thought was simple small talk about me graduating college next year, but then he mentioned taking me out to celebrate it. He also asked for my phone number in case he wanted to buy something else and instead of writing down somewhere just told me \"It's OK I'll memorize it, I could never forget your phone number haha\"\n\nNow, this shouldn't repulse like it did, after all I'm 24 and therefore a consenting adult being respectfully pursued by another adult, but I couldn't help but feel immensely grossed out about this interaction. I've even been avoiding people and stopped saying hello to them on the streets, especially men, and overall just stopped being friendly and became even more of a bitch than I already was since this happened. I've even stopped dressing myself up in cute outfits in order to not attract that sort of attention from men\n\nAnd to put you in context, flashback to a few years back, I was asked on a date by a cashier at a supermarket when I was only 14 and the man in question was in his 30s. He was actually quite respectful about it and even asked my mom for permission first. Age gaps like these are (unfortunately) pretty much socially acceptable where I live but regardless, I think you all can see why an adult taking intrest in my 14 year old self would disgust me. But truly what bothered me the most about this is that at that time I was bullied relentlessly by the boys at my school, one specific guy would \"flirt\" with me as a joke because everyone found the idea of any guy finding me attractive ridiculous and hilarious. Therefore, the fact that the only person who could possibly be attracted to me was a raggedy old shit (at least that how I saw him at the time)  made me feel so pathetic, it made me feel like low hanging fruit. It just made me realize how naive and vulnerable I truly was and how others clearly perceived me as such as well, cuz God knows a 30 year old who feels attracted by teenagers doesn't like them because they're \"mature for their age\" and quite the opposite, they like them because they're still young, impressionable and easy to manipulate.\n\nFlashforward to now, I feel like I'm in a simillat situation with this other man. I mean, the guy I like doesn't seem to like me back or even notice me in fact the guys and people in general at college see me as weird just like it had always been in High School, and again, the only person who seems to see me differently is someone who could very well be my father. It makes me feel pathetic, small and like a piece of meat, because this man doesn't know me, he doesn't spend 4 hours a day in class with me, he has no idea of who I am or what my personality is like which means he only likes me because of my appearance and because I'm young and I get that that's a normal reason to pursue someone for most people but it's just something that disgusts me to an unbereable degree.\n\nI already have enough troubles relating and mingling with people, I struggle with even liking and being attracted to someone and the complicated emotions that come along with it and overall just misanthropy issues, only for this thing to happen to me and make everything even more complicated than it already is for me.",

        "Text": "It’s been a hard couple of months lately because I’ve been thinking a lot about a lot of stuff and while doing that and checking out subreddits such as the aphantasia subreddit I found out about Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory (SDAM) and realized that’s my problem, I have that, and it explains a lot. SDAM basically means I don’t have episodic memories (like movies in your head of past events or something like that, idk what it’s like since I don’t have them but I think it’s probably something like Inside Out, whatever) I only have semantic memories (basically facts, I just know facts). So it’s all I’ve been thinking about and it’s really weighing down on me. But it has its benefits, like for example I physically cannot hold grudges, I don’t get anxious or stressed about things that have passed, I do great in logical classes since I have a better understanding and analysis of facts than the average person, I can let things go very easily, and I forget ever having felt sad, angry, annoyed or anything like that in the past tense. I am physically forced to live on the present since my past does not exist in my brain, my factual memories don’t feel like my own, they don’t feel like my memories. It’s funny because I’ve always felt and joked around about how I just “exist”, and now I know that in my brain I’ve never existed (past tense). I’m really trying to see the good things about this but here comes the consequences: I don’t have a sense of self, I find it near impossible to connect emotionally with people, I don’t remember happy moments either, I can’t integrate myself in normal conversations (like storytelling or relating with each other through experiences), I can’t “make memories”, I feel so insanely disconnected from everything, I can forget having fun in the spam of a second which feels so wrong, I can’t reflect on the past, school lectures don’t do shit for me so I’m wasting money (I’m better off reading the material), I’ve never been moved by absolutely anything in my life, I can’t miss people (can be a benefit and a downside I guess), and I think I’m probably depressed so I think that’s why it’s weighing down on me so much since I think I mentioned quite a bit of benefits… But the things is those “benefits” are human experiences that in the end are tools for growth, aren’t they? I find it way harder to learn from my mistakes over the average person. My biggest problem is that I don’t reach out to people. I can’t. It feels like it’d be a burden for anyone I tell. I can’t even open up to therapists it just feels so wrong. It’s like I’m constantly wearing a mask because wherever someone talks to me I just smile and laugh, even if they’re making me angry or sad it’s not like I’ll remember it. But as soon as I’m not happy then that’s it, in my brain it’s like I’ve never been happy, it’s like nothing is capable of making me happy. When I turn off all screens only my environment exists. It’s so quiet. It’s so lonely. I feel so fucking alone for fuck sake. I would try to reach out to my mom but she’s emotionally unavailable and I’ve learned that the hard-way since I constantly tried to reach because I’d forget that I would just end up hurting more after talking about my emotions with her.

        "Text": "I feel like I don’t belong in this world. I’m 28, a man, and I can’t handle life the way I’m supposed to. I’m too sensitive—for everything. Criticism crushes me. Stress paralyzes me. Even normal daily challenges feel overwhelming, like I’m suffocating under the weight of expectations I’ll never meet.I can’t work hard like other people. I’ve tried and failed. The world seems built for people who can push through pain and pressure, but I break under it. Every failure feels like proof that I’m weak, broken, not enough.\n\nI’ve only ever had one relationship, and even that fell apart because of my instability. I feel like no one can love someone this fragile, especially when I can’t even love myself. The world tells me to \"man up,\" but how do I do that when being \"sensitive\" is seen as a flaw? Every day, I feel like I’m drowning in my own mind, and no one around me seems to understand.\n\nIf anyone else feels this way—too weak, too sensitive, too broken—how do you survive? How do you find your place in a world that feels too hard for people like us? Thanks for reading!",

Although she was very kind she just kept saying stuff like “That must be hard/stressful” which just resulted in a lot of awkward silence, because I don’t know how to respond to that. I also told her that I’m working on improving myself and that includes my appearance because I just can’t do the whole “Love yourself thing” when I’m unhappy with the way that I currently am. She told me that most the stuff that I wanted to change was fine but that I shouldn’t try to loose weight. I asked her why which she couldn’t really answer (I’m at the lower end of a healthy weight, but I gained about 4-5kg due to depression which obviously wasn’t healthy). I booked another session for this coming week to give her a chance, but I don’t think much is going to come off it. I feel that a therapist who will help me quit my bad habits and call me out on stupid behaviours would be much more helpful. Someone with a more “Tough love” approach if you will. If anyone has any recommendations for what type of therapy/therapists I should look into that would be immensely helpful.",

Everytime I'm reminded of my past actions, I feel like throwing up because of guilt. \n\nJust 2 days ago I got triggered and I unconsciously threw my fan that someone was trying to borrow, she frowned and looked at me irritated because I didn't wanna let her borrow it. The situation being, I was in class just quiet when someone called my name and asked to borrow my fan, I said no because I need it cause it's really hot and I'm sweaty then she explained she needs it for an activity, I couldn't bear to part with my fan knowing I'll be drenched in my own sweat. I said no, I was still trying to teach myself not to be a people pleaser to think about myself too and be selfish if needed, but her friend butted in cutting me off while I was speaking. She said in an irritated voice and quite shouting while frowning and looking angry, \"she said she needs it\"- I got triggered by that, I just threw my fan in front of the girl that wants to borrow it, I did not throw it at her, but I threw it while her friend was still speaking. I realized what I had done just after a few seconds, they looked quite shocked and her friend even more irritated and frowned. I wanted to apologize but I couldn't bring myself to do it because she looks angry. I'm triggered by a slight change in tone or even emotions shown in the face. \n\n I kept thinking that If only I had just already let her borrow it I'd not wallow in my self hatred and guilt, that if only I had apologized my guilt would be lessened. I've been clean for 2 weeks now and it's hard to stop me from harming myself, I just pinch myself hard to make it leave my mind. When I think about all the things that makes me guilty even for the smallest things it makes me wanna kms, I feel like I deserve it and I could make it up through my death. I'm scared of what I can do please give me your opinion about this.",

        "Text": "I've been struggling with my mental health lately, and it's partly due to an ongoing situation with a girl I’ve been texting since my bachelor’s. We never met in person, but she was from my college. At first, we had a casual, online friends-with-benefits arrangement, but things eventually started to get out of hand. She began pushing for a relationship, and I realized it was becoming too much for me. I told her I couldn’t continue like that, and I ended up blocking her on all platforms.\n\nBut then, she started creating fake accounts to reach out to me, trying to pull me back into conversations. Eventually, she told me she was manipulative, and there were times she made extreme statements, even pretending she was going to die. It got so bad that I had to delete all my social media apps just to get some space.\n\nDespite all this, she kept emailing me, even after I cut contact. Once, she even blamed me for everything wrong in her life, acting as though I was the reason she might commit suicide. We were never even in a relationship, but it was emotionally overwhelming. Recently, after her mom passed away, she reached out again through mutual friends, and I felt pressured into responding. I sent one message, but I didn’t follow up. Now, I’m living abroad, but the emails still come, and they always end up in my spam folder, which makes it even harder to avoid.\n\nShe’s also told me that she wouldn’t marry me but just wants to love me, which only adds to the confusion. Looking back, I realize too late that she was being manipulative, and I’m struggling to move forward from it. I feel mentally drained and tortured by the whole situation, and I don’t know how to fully break free from it.",

He was about  to charge towards me but he was stopped. Had he not been stopped, I could've pushed him on the stairs and violently maul him with a fire extinguisher! 🙄\n\nThere was also one instance last 2019 that because a cab driver refused to give me my change and tried to scam me, I violently beat him with my bare hands whilst the cab is moving and I partially  damaged his eyes simply because he said a trigger word (when I was beaten by my dad last 2018).\n\nAfter that fiasco, I had a psychotherapy to channel my anger towards somewhere and it seems to work.\n\nBut last December 2023 to January 2024, there was an instance where I slammed my keyboard and mouse due to a customer frustration and trembled whilst I blacked out. Luckily, my teammate held me tightly to prevent further catastrophe.\n\nI think my IED relapsed at this point and whenever I watch violent or graphic scenes, I always think that I'm in that scenario and beating the bad guys terribly.\n\nThere were some points that if I was trashtalked hard in a GC, I retaliated so hard that I went on my way to tag people who were involved. I didn't hesitate to use deep words just to get to the point.\n\nI get so agitated when people don't answer questions directly and won't even hesitate to cut connections with them for that. Families are not spared. If they are toxic, I would immediately cut them from my life.\n\nI even lost my empathy 100% and only seeing all people as tools for my goals, including my family.\n\nTL;DR - I think my IED has relapsed. My dizzy spells happen 5 times a week esp. when I watch violent news because I hate injustice and I want to beat all the bad guys as what is always in my head. 🙄\n\nWhat mental disorders do I have? I need help before it gets worse.\n\nI was thinking of getting a psychological assistance but I might be negatively branded and shunned at my work, since this is a content moderating job.\n\nIs this already enough for me to get a PWD ID? 😐\n\nMy previous psychologist even advised me against playing ML: BB because I might be triggered but I find ML: BB helping me to release all my stress and tension.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm confused at this point. ",

He say friends are a waste of time and we are disturbing his aspirations and plans always.\n\nYesterday he broke up with me, said beeing with me caueses him pain and that im always brining up problems ( like always taling about his schizofrenia and ways to get him help). He criticized things that I do to help him manage his illness). Some time ago he said one of his delusions was saying I was cheating on him and I was a spy. I wonder if his brain keeps creating negative things about me and its overwhelming so he preffers to just isolate and push me away. \n\nSince he doesent have friends and all his family isnt suportive (or dont even believe in medicine) I fear he will go down a very bad path. I really dont think he is able to take care of himself right now. I was the one remembering him to take his medication and going with him to doctor apointments. \n\nTerrible things go trough my mind: him getting homeles, not treating his disease making his symptoms worst, him doing bad things against himself, loneliness... How can my heart deal with this thoughts and pain? And he wont even allow me to help anymore. I wish I believed in god, heaven or other lives. I cant stand this reality where he will suffer so much.

My brother (15) has autism, and was unfortunately only diagnosed last year even though it's been obvious and we all knew for years. You can blame his parents, his dad doesn't believe he has autism (still), and my mom kinda just let's things happen even if she complains about it. I (22F) have noticed some disturbing tendencies he's having, and i feel hopeless to help bc i live an hour away and am not his parent.\nSo he's also been sadly raised on YouTube and stuff. I tried so much growing up to try and get my mom to limit his screen time, but she has her own set of issues (alot).\nSo my concern: \nI think he has sexual behavior problems. He doesn't notice when he is aroused, and it's often at inappropriate times. He's gotten really touchy around me (he's taller than me already), and ofc i stop it and try to explain to him why he can't do that. And just today, he was playing with another kid and he was being so weird, like how you'd see an incep act purposely or smthm. Like, wanting to kiss her; when we were leaving, he awkwardly asked for a hug, and then mumbled that he wanted a kiss too. Is it something like starved for affection? He's not a bad kid, and i know it isn't malicious bc I've spoken to him and he seems genuinely confused and embarrassed. He has a counselor now, but he's only been once so far. Idk how to even bring this up, bc I don't want to make it sound like I'm calling him a sexual deviant, but i also don't want him to end up assaulting someone bc he was never taught any better. And I've also yelled at my mom several times to get him social classes and put him in a program for kids with autism, but idk...she just hasn't done it yet. I'm not his mom,  I can only help so much...",

I can’t get therapy after that. \n\nTo be brutally honest I’m now borderline starving myself because I physically can’t get myself to the gym all the time with uni, charity work, volunteering and work. \n\nMy male housemates are arseholes who steal my shit, steal the other girls shit, don’t clean up after themselves, don’t replace what they’ve stolen and keep me up until 4am every night and the landlord won’t do anything about it. One of them is an illegal immigrant and a major safety risk to the girls in the house and no one including the council or home office will/has done anything about it. They specifically target women in the house which is relevant to my point at the end. \n\nThe girls are lovely and hated the way the boys acted and spoke about it constantly until I asked the boys who stole my sentimental bottle of gin and suddenly they’ve become best friends with the boys and started ignoring me??? After HATING their behaviour more than I did??? I now resent them. What did I do wrong for standing up for myself?? I wasn’t safe outdoors due to being drugged and robbed now I can’t even be safe in my own home that I can’t move out of because it’s a student property so I’d have to pay £20k rent by April. \n\nI’m resenting all my friends from the sports club for not supporting me enough and complaining about minor mistakes I make, making me feel like I can’t get anything right and giving up. \n\nI’m resenting my other friends for ignoring me because they’ve all entered relationships and can’t be arsed seeing my any more.\n\nI’m resenting the guy I put all my trust into despite my ptsd for him to just take advantage of me.\n\nI’m resenting my mum for a long list of reasons.\n\nI’m resenting the charity work I’m doing for men’s mental health knowing that no matter how much I care about the mental health of men they are making me suffer constantly through mistreatment towards women.\n\nIf it wasn’t for my dad who lives alone I wouldn’t have a reason to continue. I’m trying to hard to be better and get better and everything is getting worse. \n\n",

        "Text": "I've never been one for \"hard\" drugs, but I realized earlier last year that I get addicted to things very easily. From alcohol to prescription drugs to weed and to the topic of today, shrooms. I took my first batch when my uncle was going in and out of the hospital on a weekly basis. When I took them, I thought that I could lessen the blow of what we all knew was coming, but I learned really quickly that it was a mistake. The anxiety and internal screaming became constant. When I wasn't dealing with that, I felt like I wasn't even me anymore. I began to believe that I had stolen someone else's body and memories, and this lasted until a few months ago. When I looked in the mirror, I wouldn’t be there, but in my place would be this four-legged humanoid thing. I began cursing people out, punching holes in walls, and even harming myself. These outbursts would happen before I could even stop them. Ruined a few personal relationships because of that. It was a rough time until I got off of the shrooms, but even when I quit, I was heavily abusing weed. While the effects weren’t as strong, I used it so much that I was still left out of touch with what was real and what wasn’t. I became depressed and thought that my family was going to be murdered whenever I left for work, when they wouldn’t answer calls, when they wouldn’t answer texts… I can’t turn on the stove without thinking they’re going to die; I can’t leave my house without running back in a panic because of the thought of someone breaking in and causing them harm. It’s just been a struggle, but I kept putting up with it because drugs made life suck less. \n\nNow, I haven't had shrooms since May of this year. I still have moments in time where I don't feel like this body is actually mine, but it's better than always feeling that way. I tried speaking to friends about how I never felt like this was me and how my memories weren't making sense, but they just told me that everyone felt like that. I asked them again recently if it was normal, but they said no this time, and now I'm fighting the paranoia about my friends not really being my friends. I have this little part of me telling me that they’re using me as loony entertainment. I try to push that voice to the back of my mind and start completely new. I still have terrible intrusive thoughts and sometimes I can “feel” the motor neurons firing off to get me moving to do those actions. It’s a very awkward place to be. Other than that, I am trying to find my normal again and make the memories I have make sense.",

I live for one person and to ensure that this person lives well; my mother.\n\nI grew up in a hostile home. Lots of yelling and screaming. More often than not, my mother would be the cause of it. (Yes, she is mentally ill and does, according to her medical record, suffer from mild retardation due to a blunt force trauma to her head.)\n\nDue to my siblings, my parents were often busy with their shenanigans; both in as well as outside of a courtroom.\n\nThis has led me to, in my mothers words, 'raise myself'.\n\nI am, at the time of posting, 27.\n\nI have never had friends.\nI have never had an emotional or sexual connection with another person.\nI have also never held the hand of someone who reciprocates my feelings.\nI have also seldom experienced being hugged; barring never being hugged by someone in an affectionate manner. \n\nI try not to vent about these things, but negative emotions do tend to bottle up and every glass can only handle so much pressure. \n\nPotentially due to these factors, I haven't developed much emotionally or in any kind of physically intimate way. \n\nPhysical contact, barring handshakes and the like, make me uncomfortable. I get extremely nervous if someone tries to touch me in an intimate manner. I just freeze. As a man, I don't like this. It makes me feel weak and emasculated to a point that I had considered suicide. Those thoughts don't linger any longer, but the feeling of weakness and inconfidence still persists. \n\nI have confidence and self-esteem issues to put on top of everything else as well. I try to do right by others and to help guide those younger than myself onto a better path, but I still feel.... for lack of any better term, barren.\n\nI feel a machine that just wakes up, works, clocks out plays a games that stresses me out and sleep for 4-6 hours. \n\nThe game that I play is the only depth that I have to me. It does not matter what game it is, but that is the only place I am recognized. It is where my only depth lies.\n\nI only came to these conclusions, to my own lack of depth, after being told by a long time acquaintance, and forgive the paraphraseology, 'we've been playing this game for roughly 10 years man, and you have always been negative or toxic about it. If there was anyone else besides me that lead this guild, you would have been banned years ago. You never have anything positive to say and you never have anything positive to share.'\n\nThe only thing that I could find is an apology.\n\nA bit later, on the same call, I brought up music that evokes emotion in myself. When I asked this guild lead if he had any of those songs, he said that of course he does; everyone does.\n\nI don't remember the convo in-between, but I know I said that 'I don't feel good emotions, so I don't know how to explain it, but it brings me to tears when I hear it. '\n\nHe paused for a moment and just said that that is extremely sad to hear.\n\nWe gamed for a bit more, but I got frustrated and exited the call.\n\nI just sat and reflected on the fact that someone picked up on that I am just a bundle of negative emotions and not even, I, myself know why. \n\nAll I can ask you all is: What do I do? \n\n",

We have no relationship as a father and daughter anymore. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do, I wanna run, but I have nowhere to run to because I have no other family I can go to. I have no friends because I have alienated myself from everybody the housing list to get it takes months and so I’m stuck either. I stay here and continue to endure all of this or I pack my car and I live in it until I can get housing Because my mental issues motivated to do that my dad is mad at me because he says I won’t get a job but he doesn’t understand why I can’t. I almost covered my spine because I have permanent nerve damage getting a job where I can work from home has proven to be difficult. My question is what do I do? Where do I go? I just need some advice from somebody because I can’t seem to get it from anybody that is close to me. If anybody could help even if it’s just a talk, please message me. I’m not good mentally right now. I know I did things that me in this position. Not to mention my mental state is another thing that helped me get here.

All of this has been very traumatic and destroyed how I viewed my parents.

For the past several years, I have felt like what I thought was maybe depression but when I read about other peoples experiences with depression online it doesn’t really sound like me. \n\nFor example, I do not hate myself, I actually love myself and despite not seeing family or friends anymore I know I am well loved and lucky to have people who care for me. I have never had an addictions problem and never used drugs, I don’t drink. \n\nMy problem is just an overwhelming fatigue for life. I spend most days in bed. I like being asleep more than I like being awake. My dreams are amazing and transport me to some incredible places. I am severely burnout from work and I have no choice but to keep going in order to pay the bills. I hate where I live but despite having a great job I can’t afford to live anywhere else. I am too tired to hang out with friends or find new relationships and to be honest the mundane small talk just bores me. \n\nI feel like the problem isn’t me it’s just that life genuinely sucks. I don’t want to live this way but every time I try I’m just reminded of how awful the world is. \n\nIs this depression or something else? ",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, I feel like I am on the verge of losing my mind and not even therapy has been successful in helping me. I am too aware of my problem for my therapist to make confident determinations. One suggested I'm struggling with OCD, but this hasn't happened to me before and it is purely emotional, another told me to practice letting go, but it's been months and I can not let it go.\n\nHere is what happened in very, very, very simple terms. I'm leaving out details for the sake of keeping it short, but this is what happened, and my struggle is internal, it's got nothing to do with the person anymore.\n\nI visited a girl I've often visited professionally for a certain thing.\n\nDuring this meeting, which was good as always, things got more intimate than normal. By pure reflex, I made a movement that killed the vibe. The girl reacted negatively, probably taking it as a rejection, and basically told me I didn't have to be there anymore, which is very unprofessional. After the incident, I reflected on what happened, and I began understanding her point of view more and more. I even understood why she'd cut professional ties even if inappropriate. I made her feel stupid and I must've impacted her on a fundamental level. She was interested, took a chance, and *this* is how I made her feel. This made my heart sink, and I have not been able to recover from this since.\n\nImmediately after the incident, I tried seeing her again, but she avoided me. Suspecting it was from embarrassment, I made a few attempts over the course of a month but finally, respected that she wanted nothing to do with me anymore and this is how it would play out.\n\nSince then, I've seen her outside, and she's stared at me, which triggered a sense of guilt and shame again. She's laughed out loud with friends and then looked away, making me feel like they are laughing at me. On a purely logical level, I figure I must've hurt her ego and this is her way of rejecting me back. It's fine. I didn't do anything really, but she's a person and might be hurt.\n\nOver time, however, I've kept ruminating on this, hating on myself more and more, and developing a pathological need to make it up to this person.\n\nIt's been going on for 6 months now. I've felt depersonalization, guilt, shame, panic and suffered from a constant brain fog. The worst symptoms are the ones I'm going through right now. I feel like I am constantly in my head. I'm unable to keep myself ground and I can't focus on physical things anymore. All I can think about is the guilt or shame associated with this event, which was half a year ago now. I don't feel positive, feel depressed, and I don't see it getting better, it is only getting worse. I'm afraid of making a fool of myself in this state and making my life worse. I'm starting to become really afraid.\n\nThe entire emotion is rooted in guilt and shame.\n\nWhat on earth could it be that I'm going through?",

I think, like many who grew up with childhood trauma, we found a way to fake being okay so well that on the outside, I don’t think people take some of us seriously, or can, or want to, I’m not sure. I’ve been told I present myself in such a way that I come off egotistical, confident, wealthy, charismatic, all the good things. But in my mind, I’m definitely not doing great.\n\nI digress. Would like to hear experiences on talk therapy apps (like betterhelp, ReGain or others I haven’t heard of) - I either can’t or am not ready to sit face to face with a therapist to discuss my issues, but I can be much more comfortable in texting back & forth with a therapist. I could maybe even see FaceTime or a phone call. \n\nWould also like to add I don’t have much money (millennial - go figure) and if there is any sort of state or federal program or anything of that nature in regards to online therapy - I do have Medicaid, I could call their nurse hotline but, would love to hear others experience.",

Once I went to high school I started to enjoy life more but once COVID hit, my grades tanked and I had to switch schools. The first school I went to tormented me mentally. The teachers mistreated me and the classmates threatened me on numerous occasions. \n\nThe year after that I switched schools again, and in the beginning it was actually quite pleasant, I had good grades and I just started the gym, I met this girl that I also liked and I was pretty motivated to have a good life again, however halfway through the year I had bad grades again, I was constantly hungry, due to malnutrition from the gym, the girl that I spoke to started to mistreat me by blackmailing me and tormenting me, my teacher also harassed me numerous times by purposefully lowering my grades, and telling me to stay after class every week (I already had to stay at school to 5). The friends that I made also started backstabbing me by posting things on social media and talking behind my back. I succeeded my exams but I was still hopeful that I could live well.\n\nThe year after that I decided to follow a new class and right of the bat the year was hard. I decided to compete in powerlifting and almost a week after I signed up for my first meet I injured my back, I got no sympathy from my friends and my parents told me that I was complaining too much, I failed my first tests and I resented a lot of people in my class, mainly because a few of them were the ones that tormented me the year prior. I signed up for another meet but my school didn't tell me when the tests were so I had to call that meet off as well. One of the guys that tormented me the year prior made the entire school gang up on me so I was also completely isolated that year. One teacher made it her routine to accuse me of things that I did not do, such as coming in to late, when the bell did not ring, as well as homework issues. With the last project she also gave me the lowest score even though in my group I did the most work. By the end of the year I also nearly failed my exams and I started to show signs of heavy tremors in my hands and being overly stressed, right before the exams I also gravely injured my back again, nearly tearing a muscle off of the bone. Right now, I am still not as strong as before the injury. By the end of that year I resented everyone and I hated how I was treated.\n\nThis year I joined college and right off the bat my university displayed some of the worst incompetence, by not notifying me about a presentation, and sending the wrong assignments. I also joined a social club where due to some problems I got kicked out and re-invited again, but it was already a month in when I re-joined the club. Most people know each other and I feel incredibly isolated, not just in the social club but also in the gym that I go to and my own study. I also developed a hatred towards the study that I am following despite last year, it was something that I liked to study in my own free time. \n\nAt the time of writing, I have spoken to numerous therapists that deny what I am feeling, and I am always angry. I don't get the feeling that people listen to me, especially my parents, and don't tolerate my existence, and I doubt it's getting better anytime soon. I quit gym due to injuries, so there is no way for me to let out my frustration anymore",

When i first moved to ireland from my home country, i ofc had to go to a new school.\n\nKEEP IN MIND ‼️: i was in that school for 2 years and then i moved my school to the school im currently in.\n\nI met 2 girls (im not gonna say their real names but i am gonna call them emma and anna).\nThe first few weeks when we were friends, they were pretty nice. But soon it all started getting bad. They started talking behind my back and bullying me a LOT. When i say a lot i mean a whole lot. They used to bully me mentally and physically sm that i wasnt even able to get out of bed some mornings.\n\nEmma was sometimes very friendly but then she was very mean.. After sometime of bullying me mentally and physically she started being very touchy. I used to be so uncomfortable… I used to tell her always to stop but she wasnt stopping. After i got s@‘d a few times by Emma i started doing things i shouldnt have done to myself. Im not gonna go into detaill abt it because i just can’t.\n\nNow you’re probably gonna ask “Why didn’t you just ask for help?” I couldnt. I really couldnt.. they used to threaten me and say that bad things will happen to my family if i tell anyone.\n\nThe whole 2 years i was there, her other friend Anna knew about EVERYTHING. ABSOLUTELY EVERY. SINGLE. THING.\n\nThen.. i finally moved. My mom found a better location to move to since it was VERY VERY VERY close to the capital. (basically there are better jobs here)\n\nAfter all the bullying i got from there, i got left with some stuff such as: attachment issues, social anxiety, ocd, bipolarity and depression. (this isnt all from them, since i also used to get abused by my dad, but they mostly made them even worse than they were before i meet them. also, all of them are diagnosed )\n\nAnyways, after i moved to my new school i meet these 9 girls which i am in a friend group with 2 of them. I kinda like one of the girls but that isnt the point. 😜🤭 (i’m gonna call them adele and poppy since i dont want to say their real names.)\n\nToday i was with Adele on call and i had a mental breakdown and i told her everything. (i usually talk to her even up to 10hrs a day.) She helped me get the courage to text these girls a whole paragraph abt how they ruined my life and how they are such b!tches. \n\nAnd guess what? I DID IT. After i did it i had a panic attack because i got flash backs but now im so relieved. I havent felt so good in 2 years.\nAfter i sent them the paragraph i blocked them right away. Idgaf abt them anymore. They sa’d me and mentally and physically bullied and abused me for 2 years straight. I also said in the paragraph that i hope that everything that they did to me to come back to me (apart from the s@)\n\n‼️ IF THERE IS GONNA BE ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING I’LL LET Y’ALL KNOW ‼️",

Now, that part is important for the background. I am in therapy and on medication. But the next part is something that I haven't yet shared with my Therapist (a little shame, I suppose) and I am just looking for some kind of explanation. Maybe, some of you have any idea/experience (sorry) that can help me understand this?\n\nThese days the fact that I wet my bed until the age of 12-13 is kind of coming up a lot in my thoughts. I remember what is was like. I would dream that I have to pee and I would pee and immediately wake up because of the wet feeling. Because I was old enough to know how wrong it was, my first instinct was to get a iron. I would iron my sheet and Mattress dry and change my clothes before going to bed (yes, it did probably stink, but no tangible indication was left). My mother didn't know this was happening. She already had punished me a lot for wetting my bed at the age of 5-6 and I was too scared to tell her. \n\nNow, I know the abuse from my father and the punishments from my mother (which I now understand came from how overwhelmed she was dealing with my mysogynistic father) can be somewhat of a stimuli. But, what I am wondering is if it was because of some kind of sexual abuse.\n\nThis part is also something I have never discussed with my Therapist, because I don't have all the information and I don't want to psychoanalyse it based on some feelings I had at the age I wasn't old enough to understand the feelings. I will explain what feelings I am talking about now. I had this distinct feeling of arousal when I was 5. I didn't know what it was, all I knew that it made me feel funny in my crotch areas. As I got older, I understood what it was and it always felt really wrong to me. It made me view sex as a negative and aggressive action. I have since dealt with my sex issues and I maintain a healthy sex life now. \n\nThe reason behind my confusion is that all of my father's brothers (he has 3 brothers) have been at least once in their life accused of sexual assault (never my father). My father was an asshole and abused my mother sexually, but he never had any complaints from women outside the home, which is quite the opposite in case of my uncles.\n\nSince the negative feelings about funny crotch feelings started as early as I was 5, I think I may have been sexually abused by my uncles. Quite late in my life, my mother told me how she made sure that there was minimum alone time between me and my uncles, but it was inevitable (she left the room for Laundry or cooking). I don't know if something happened, and I don't want my mother to relive any kind of trauma, so I don't want to ask her (she's been through enough as is). \n\nThe thing is I have a feeling, my mother may have a memory, of me being sexual assaulted. There's no way of knowing for sure. I think it also kind of theraupetic to just type it out. Any insight you lovely people may have would be great for me! ",

I work in a bar and have worked in this same bar for close on 5 years and have never felt this way. To continue, I am a generally introverted person and would like to think I’m very nice to most people I meet and interact with. However, in this recent time period I have found myself constantly thinking about getting drunk, moreso whilst working. This however is not what bothers me, uponst having what would usually have been a single pint of beer after work has turned into needing to get absolutely plastered everyday.\n\nAnyways, this is still not the main issue for me. I consider(ed) myself quite a heavyweight drinker. But now for some reason it’s feels like i cant handle half as much as I used to. And upon getting drunk I get extremely depressed, violent, aggressive and basically the worst person you could think of when getting drunk. I’m pushing away everyone and feel terrible all the time about my actions when I am drunk like this around people. This is not me, I never feel any feelings like this when sober.\n\nI have tried going full cold turkey but after working a 10 hour shift in a bar as a manager I just find it fooking impossible to not have a free drink after work. \n\nAlso please read below for medication I’m currently taking, I’m very suspicious of my new anxiety medication as it is only recently I began taking it (Lexapro/escitalopram)\n\n\nFor extra context, in case this stuff is important I’ll leave it here:\n• I have ADHD and (social)anxiety\n• I just started lexapro/escitalopram in the last 3 months (could this cause extra inhibition/addiction/aggression?)\n• I have been taking dexamphetamines for about 3 years\n\nLove y’all <3 be safe ",

To avoid this situation I decided to have a smoke and try calming down which did work and let me cool off from the heat of the moment. The main problem came in today while I was at my fathers house in the form of a text from my mother and an image of a half finished pack of my cigarettes that I had forgotten on the counter before leaving the house. I told my mother that those are the cigarettes of my friend for who I’m stashing them in return for some money but she found them in the bathroom where I left the window open to air out the smell because i tough I’d get home today and clean up but she got there before I did. I have no idea how to get out of this situation because I don’t want my mother to know I’m depressed and suicidal again because she’ll send me to therapy which I think is a waste of the time people with real problems need.

        "Text": "I met this guy while we were at the mental hospital. We instantly started talking, and then after, the chemistry built up over time. He is so funny; he makes things outlandishly amusing whenever he sees things. The energy level was the same as mine, which vibed very well. We both decided that we would like to meet up once we leave the hospital. We didn't do anything PDA or anything inappropriate but talked, connected, and hung around most of the time. There was one part where we rubbed each other's feet. lol, that was it! We both got out of the hospital and finally had a chance to meet up. It was great the first few times we met; we were instantly ready for a relationship. Things did have to turn around because we both noticed that we were going too fast, and we had intercourse, which was an uncomfortable situation for both of us. He started overreacting that he needed to run away from the situation and began making excuses for nitpicking on specific things. He was so sure about the breakup that it got to the point where there was no point in trying to save the situation. I apologized for whatever I had done and told him that I would always be there whenever and also, if you needed a ride (He couldn't drive his car), I was available to help out. He agreed to it, and over time, we started to develop the connection again; it just had to be taken slower. \n\nAs I started hanging out with him, I noticed he was not as physically touchy as before. Also, it seems more one-sided When it comes to having a conversation. For instance, I would bring up things, but he would listen and then move on to the next topic. Sometimes, he would interrupt my sentence by saying something else that would change the subject. He is also very particular; He likes orderly things and is obsessed with vintage toy figures. He's into more classical/old-school perspectives. He also seems playful and unsure of what to do when we kiss each other. (He has been in relationships before, by the way) He would get too nervous or uneasy but feel OK about kissing.\n\nI ensure that he feels comfortable and ask him questions about his feelings; most of the time, he's OK, according to his responses. I also ask him questions about love language to ensure we are both on the same page and that it doesn't lead to an uncomfortable situation. Most of the answers are uncertain, and he feels pressured when I ask him those questions. Most of the time, he doesn't like to be on his phone to communicate or text that much. He prefers to be in his own space. There was a situation where I had suicidal ideation, and it was building up badly where I needed to be around people. I asked him about it, and he said no, and he apologized because he was not in a good head space. If I had come over, it would have made things worse and not helped me. (Which I was empathizing with and understanding).",

Privacy and giving space to individual is not a thing here. To give you some perspective I am living with my parents. I am 30 plus and unmarried. My parents are those sort of people who are short tempered and can never handle a situation well. They used to fight a lot before but they decided to stay in marriage even though they would probably be better off. These fights were ugly and used to affect me a lot. Again I would reiterate they are highly conservative, delutional probably due to fact that my dad never worked worked more than 3-4 years and mom is illiterate. \n\nI am going to stick to my journey. I work in an MNC and am well paid. I was working out of different city before but came back to live with my parents during covid. Now here is the thing - all there stupid habit like shouting, fighting etc would leak into the video/voice call which would highly embarass me in front of client. \nAs these shenangans increased,I took matters in my own hands.\n\n1. I decided to change locks in balcony create off limit spaces so they dont yell in balcony\n\n2. Password locked their TV volume to discouage them from viewing content in full volume\n\nIn course of this i got mad one day and in fit of rage i smacked my hand into glass.The blood i lost that day atleast stopped them from creating nuisance during client calls\n\nCut to yesterday, \n\nMy dad shares the same washroom with me to smoke every day every hour. Which highly irritates me.I have told him 10,000 times not to do it. He wont even turn the exhaust. If he wants smoke to he can go to his side of balcony and still do it.\n\n3. Adamant and giving me deaf ear to all what I have been saying every day just triggered me to pour oil on the washroom floor. Intention here was he would find it wet and not do it ever. I did keep the oil on the basin so that he sees it as a sort of precaution.\n\nBut what I hear he slipped a bit and we had an argument. He didnt have any injury and anything. But I gave him a piece of my mind. Years of frustration came out when he used to control me by not giving me even pocket money to do stuff I wanted to do like read books, buy my first cycle etc. I felt he never really wanted me to be indepedent. Probably why he never taught me how to drive during adolescence. I still hold grudge against him for slapping me in front of my school friends back in the day when it wasnt my fault at all.\n\nMy intention here was never to harm parents. I know I probably cant live without them but I cant live with them anymore. I can move out but it is frowned upon where I come from. Also here is another challenge. I dont have any brothers or sisters. I dont know how to buy a house. I have even seen the world outside my work sponsored trips.\n\nAnd yes I dont have a girlfriend. I probably could have had few if I had tried but my life has been a package of being morose and frustation that I really didnt want anyone else to share this burden.\n\nWhy are people like this? What am I doing wrong? Why dont they these folks understand that what I am doing is for them? Was I wrong in pouring the oil? \n\nSorry i made it long.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "Text": "Okay, so there's a lot I will cover in here so the TLDR might be for you. Firstly, I'm 17M in the UK and I've been struggling mentally recently.\n\n\n\nInitially, I'll talk about my social anxiety. I'm socially inept and don't know how to make friends at all. I don't know what to say in conversations a lot and get overwhelmed sometimes in large groups. I've had a lot going on at home in the past few years (police involved), and a lot inside my own head (multiple addictions). To cope with these things, I've isolated myself and thus now since I'm getting better, I don't know how to make friends or find people like me. Another reason I haven't made friends is because I'm absolutely terrified of being humiliated or being made fun of. If someone makes a light hearted joke about me or is just messing around, I take it really personally and makes me want to cry every time. A teacher called me an odd boy and since I've been really struggling to fit in and feeling isolated in school, that made me quite upset. They didn't mean anything bad by it, but I subconsciously take it that way. Since a lot of people bond by jokes and roasts etc., I feel like I can't make friends or develop strong connections with other human beings. Finally, I see the need to improve my social skills as it improves my life, but when I say something or ask a question to people, it's almost like I didn't speak. I get no reply and no acknowledgement and that's also why I avoid groups, because I feel like a ghost as me just joining a conversation or saying something brings down the mood of people as I see it on their face. I want to improve my social skills, but why should I, if i'm not even treated like a normal person, of even a person for that matter. People want me to go out with them but don't seem to realise that I feel more alone going out than being in my own room.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, I play basketball a lot and workout too. I'm fit (6'2 210) and like to exercise and I can't really make friends at basketball because people just see me as the awkward guy or I say the wrong things at the wrong time there. Also, I don't really fit in there. I'm not sure if me playing basketball is making me really tired but after a week of school, I don't want to do anything on the weekends and just want to stay at home away from everything and it's hard for me to get work done now for A-Levels because I'm so preoccupied with everything I've listed above.\n\n\n\nI'm not really confident and I think I have quite a low self esteem. I set pretty high standards for myself, so when I don't meet standards, it just makes me mad at myself and that I'm worse than other people. I see people that are socially capable than me, as better than me, which is a bad mindset to have but it's subconscious. I also don't talk to any girls at all, so I'm quite uncomfortable around them. I don't want a gf but I think my self-esteem is too bad to have one.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this has been bugging me for the past month and I want some advice on how to be able to take a joke, make friends and improve on pretty much everything I talked about. All help is appreciated.",

The therapist symbolically assigns one part to each hand.\n2. A dialogue begins, alternating \"voices\" between hands.\n3. After each statement, a set of BLS is applied.\n4. The process continues until the conflict is adaptively resolved.\n\n# Conference Room Method\n\nA guided visualization creates a safe space for interaction between personality parts.\n\n1. **Create a Safe Room**: A welcoming mental space is imagined.\n2. **Introduce the Present-Oriented Part**: This grounded part facilitates the process.\n3. **Visualize the Problem on a Screen**: The disturbance is displayed on an imaginary screen.\n4. **Invite Parts to a \"Conference\"**: Relevant personality parts join to discuss and process the issue.\n\n**Monitoring Tools**\n\n* **Back of Head Scale (BHS)**: Assesses how present-oriented the patient feels, from fully present to immersed in traumatic memories.\n* **Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD)**: Measures the distress level associated with traumatic memories or images.\n\n**Goals and Best Practices**\n\nTherapists must apply these techniques carefully to avoid re-traumatization, ensuring a gradual and safe approach. Close monitoring is essential to maintain the patient’s orientation to the present.\n\nThe primary goals are to:\n\n* Process traumatic memories.\n* Integrate fragmented personality parts.\n* Improve emotional regulation for trauma material.\n* Enhance safety perception and present orientation.\n\nAdvanced EMDR techniques offer powerful tools for healing complex trauma and dissociation. When applied by trained professionals as part of a tailored treatment plan, they can promote integration, psychological well-being, and lasting recovery.\n\n© MilanoPsicologo.it | Centro di Psicologia e Psicoterapia [Milano](https://goo.gl/maps/AeHZSBhP4zG2) | [Terapia Cognitivo Comportamentale CBT](https://milanopsicologo.it/terapia-cognitivo-comportamentale/) \\+ [EMDR](https://milanopsicologo.it/cosa-significa-emdr/) \\+ [Neurofeedback Dinamico](https://milanopsicologo.it/neurofeedback-dinamico/)",

        "Text": "Hi, for some context, I had a huge panic attack at the beginning of September and October. I feel like they were the worst panic attacks of my life, I hated both of them and they are still traumatizing to think about to this day.\n\nI have gotten a lot better and had a minor panic attack 2 weeks ago but haven't since then. However, I feel as though whenever I feel even the slightest bit of anxiety, I get anxious about it. I try to continue what I'm doing with the presence of the anxiety to welcome it but I feel a part of me is terrified that it may escalate to the intense anxiety attack extent. \n\nEven if I try to calm myself down and continue what I'm doing, telling myself that it's okay and even greeting the anxiety, I still get scared. And I know being scared feeds the anxiety. I have had anxiety going on my laptop and I was on it for a few hours today before I got too scared. The anxiety wasn't intense, but the fear it would grow was. And walking usually helps me so I closed my laptop and have been walking around the house since.\n\nI don't want to completely rely on coping mechanisms when my anxiety gets worse and would rather sit with the anxiety but how do I get over the intense fear of the panic attack I had 2 months ago? I am looking into therapy but my brain is somehow convinced it wont work. It's convinced that I'm some rare hopeless case that won't ever heal. I'm even scared to sleep every night even though I'm able to sleep and I have no idea why. This is all slowly brewing into more anxiety by the day and at this point I'm terrified that I will have another panic attack like the one 2 months ago. This time knowing hospitals do nothing and no one helps. Please help me, what do I do?\n\n\nTLDR: Anxiety increasing as I'm terrified of panic attack I had 2 months ago happening again. Trying to start therapy but my brain is convinced I'm a hopeless case that won't heal. I feel like I'll never get better \n",

        "Text": "Hello everybody. I’m a bit nervous coming on a platform to express my struggles, but I feel like I really don’t know what else to do besides this. Unfortunately I can’t afford therapy. \n\nAnyways, I’ve been burnt out as a creative person since 2022 and haven’t recovered since. Every time I try to draw; I’m confused, stressed, and overly critical of myself and my abilities. This created feelings for me that are hard to pick apart and even understand or acknowledge. I also have PTSD and dissociation problems which make it significantly harder to understand my emotions and feelings. Art has always been my passion, and soon I want to enter college. But now I feel like I don’t have a direction. (I’m 23) My original plan was to go to college for illustration, but I literally can’t create anything I want anymore. This is my greatest strength. I don’t have a problem coming up with ideas at all, it’s when they come out that the problems begin. Which is why it’s so frustrating that I can’t create what’s in my head without becoming quickly discouraged and critical of myself. I know my ideas are good ones. I really miss enjoying my art and not hating it. I used to love the process of drawing but I absolutely hate it now. I never feel good enough and constantly see mistakes in my art instead of how nice it probably looks. I’m concerned that my burnout will extend to 3 years or even 4 years if this keeps going. \n\nLuckily, I think I found the core root of the problem which is perfectionism and criticism. But in order to improve my art I need to critique it…. It feels like I’ll never overcome this. I admit I’m not ready to draw all the time still, but I’d love to hear stories from people who have come out of this and what helped you. If not that’s ok. Some emotional support would be nice. Thanks for reading! ",

        "Text": "tw/ ed\n\nMaking this post is my last resort. My life has no meaning or purpose and i feel so lost, as cliche as it sounds it is true. I’ve had an eating disorder for two years now, it has started after seeing pics of myself from my cousins bday party. I have never been overweight, not even chubby. However, I was not skinny either, i was what u can call “healthy”. However that was the turning point for me and i stopped eating. I ate a very small meal once a day, sometimes not even that. I quickly lost 21kg and became severely thin. However, everyone in my family and my surroundings were impressed and were constantly complimenting me, telling me it was a huge accomplishment, if only they knew the pain i was in. So yeah, i lost weight. I was euphoric for a while, new outfits, new makeup styles, i truly liked what i saw in the mirror, and others liked it as well. I lost weight, and with that, i lost my menstrual cycle. At first i ignored it, or i tried. I never wanted kids so i did not think infertility would affect my life or happiness. I had the most beautiful, thick hair. I am not trying to sound obnoxious and compliment myself, i’m just reminiscing, since now it’s way thinner and dull. Some fell out. I was always cold. Long story short i tried talking to my parents, thinking it would corner me to have someone else monitor my eating habits which would then lead to me eating healthier. One thing my ed never allowed me was chocolate. At the beginning of my attempted recovery my mother made crepes with nutella, my favourite. Before that, I haven’t had them in 2 years, while my family was eating them every sunday when we were together(i’d lock myself in my bedroom). Anyways, mom made crepes and i got the first taste of nutella crepes in months. That triggered something in my brain. My binge eating disorder. I started eating in secret. Snacks from the snack drawer. Cheese from the fridge. Tortilla wraps. Toast bread. Anything quick that i could find. As soon as i was left alone i’d binge. I couldn’t control myself. I’d eat and eat and eat. But the good thing was, if there wasn’t any of the food that triggered my binges in the house, i would not binge. However, my binge eating got worse to the point where if there is nothing in the house of if there is nothing i can eat without my parents noticing it gone, id put on a jacket, grab some money and literally walk to the store, load a shit ton of chocolate, biscuits and also very important, nutella for me to eat off a spoon, and waste so much money just to stuff my face when i’m alone. I am so ashamed and disgusted by myself. My face is swollen from so much sugar. My whole body hurts from water retention. My parents work hard to earn money only for me to waste it like this. I want to stop. This is a cry for help, this has affected my life so badly i gave up on my studies and my future and i am truly so so lost. How do i stop binging. How do i fight those urges. What do i do with this water retention, i am in so much pain and so much shame. \ni feel so ashamed and so alone. ",

And a kind young man off here got me there in time.\nI was the 2 days and seen more than I wanted.\nWhilst there I cleaned her flat, washed her and her partners clothes, went to the shops for them a couple times and sorted through her friends flat at my aunt's request.\nBut then my aunts partner drunkingly let slip that whenever I call, my aunts sighed and gone 'what does she want now?'.\nMy aunt lost her youngest son 3 years ago and all I've heard was how if it wasn't for her friend my aunt wouldn't have got through it. Meanwhile, I was actually travelling to my aunt 3-4 times a week during this time, 2 hours each way via public transport. She'd phone me in the middle of the night and I'd stay on the phone to her for hours till she was ready to go to sleep. I set up a ground me to raise money from r the funeral as she was struggling, I helped arrange it, she called me up last minute as she needed me to go to the funeral hometo sign some forms a few days prior to the funeral, I had to go a pick up a supermarket shop day before the funeral and drop it off to her friends who was doing the catering. And it's as if everyone's forgotten.\n\nI feel so guilty and selfish for feeling like this considering her friend did actually pass away the morning after I got there and her friend was really lovely. But finding out what my aunt really thinks ofe behind my back has really hurt me. But then I think, should I really be surprised. As after her son's funeral and after everything I did, all of a sudden she had no time for me. I'd phone her every week and no answer. I just got dropped like I was nothing. I actually stopped speaking to her for abit because of it.\n\nI'm just so frustrated. Her being annoyed when I call but then hounding me when she can't get in touch because she's worried I may have hurt myself. Then as soon as she knows I'm safe it's back to hardly any contact.\n\nPeople constantly say you can talk to them if you need to but no one really means it. And in the meantime time I'm supposed to be able to read minds, I'm supposed to know when I should call because I go for a while without calling turn they harrass me till I answer, then once they've eased their conscience they go back to acting like I don't exist.\n\nThe only thing keeping me here is my cats. I can't hate the thought of leaving them and then possibly ending up on the streets, or separated and with people they won't look after them or love them.\n\nThis is just a ramble through tears, I know it's all over the place.\n\nI just wish \n\nI didn't exis",

Over the past year and a half, I’ve faced a lot of hate, and a recent incident triggered me so much that I spiraled and did some really stupid things.\n\nI’ve come to recognize that I have a strong tendency to self-victimize and hold an overly idealistic worldview, believing people should be kind to me simply because I haven’t done anything bad to them. I now realize this isn’t a practical way to approach life.\n\nI’m seeking advice from everyone here: How can I toughen up and overcome this victim mentality? I’m tired of this pattern in my life. Whenever someone does something bad to me, I get deeply affected, fall into depression, and retreat into a shell. I stop interacting with people and almost start fearing them.\n\nI want to become someone who can take any amount of negativity without letting it affect my mind.

She has a difficult relationship with mom which seems to be the root of her depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Around 6 months ago, she decided to move in fully with me and her step mom (who she has a great relationship with). At that point, her relationship with biological mom has become too damaged and she needed some time away from that household. However, they would still see each other during the week.\n\nThe first few months went pretty good but once school started, her mental health started to go on a steep decline. It culminated in her being hospitalized for a week due to high suicidal ideation. She started going to therapy after getting discharged. In therapy, it was revealed that she suffered from years of physical and emotional abuse from mom. The care team confronted mom about this in front of me and even had a cps investigation started.\n\nSince then, I’ve seen a genuine effort from mom to try to be better. And now, my daughter is planning to start living with her again. Though I would like for them to repair their relationship, I’m worried that moving back may re-expose her to the harmful behaviors that caused her mental health struggles. Should I support her decision? Should I do everything I can to stop her? \n\nIf anyone went through something similar, please share your thoughts. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

A lot of the time it’s a sorrow sinking feeling in the middle of my chest and it gives me really bad anxiety, sometimes I can pinpoint the reason behind it and other times I feel this way for no reason. My brain is programmed this way and it’s hard not to think negative or put myself down. People just tell you things will get better but it’s easier said than done and in the long run it doesn’t get any better, it just gets easier to ignore the feeling or find something to keep busy so you don’t have to think about it.. Putting on this fake smile for everybody else is so exhausting, just so you don’t bring anybody else down or push people away. Everybody is struggling nowadays anyways so nobody really cares or can help, one of the worse feelings is being surrounded by people but still feel so alone. I just keep hoping one day all this pain will be worth it and if not maybe life will give me a quick death, I’m tired of everyday being a struggle. Physically, mentally, financially I just feel like a weak person. It hurts so much, it’s getting worse and it’s so overwhelming I just want to go to sleep and never wake up",

And suddenly, I started having really bad nausea (never vomiting, tho), but some of the times, I felt so light-headed that I had to sit or lay down. This has started to happen more often to me, and a lot of situations provoke my nausea. \n\nAnd also, now, when I'm doing things that are kind of digusting, like entering a public bathroom or throwing out the trash, I almost always have nausea.

        "Text": "I have been an ambitious overachiever all my life. After graduating from uni was offered a job at my dream workplace. Although I was enthusiastic, I started having a really difficult time with staying on top of everything. I sought help and got diagnosed with ADHD. Following my diagnosis everything became even more difficult despite medication, but still I was able to perform well. Knowing that I was going to quit my job and move abroad for my masters degree at the end of the year, I did the best I could and found comfort in the knowledge that I would have some time to reflect on what career path I would like to pursue going forward.\n\nMoving abroad was something I wanted for a really long time and I was in the top school in my field. Everything was new and interesting, and I felt very proud of myself. However, as the stress built up, my mental health suffered a lot. At the end of the year, although I graduated with an objectively good final outcome, I was unhappy with it because I knew that I could do so much better.\n\nI started another degree with the expectation that I would be able to compensate for the previous year and open myself up to further opportunities (possibly in academia too). While I was excited about my individual research, I went through a very dark depressive episode and had to extend this second 1-year degree into a second year. At this point, I was hoping to pursue a PhD as I was interested in what I was doing, but I found myself practically crippled by my perfectionist tendencies. At the end of the second year of my one-year degree, I was unable to graduate as I could not write my thesis. This  interfered with my future plans. I missed the conditions of my PhD offer and felt completely lost. I had to move back to my parents' house in my home country. My relationship with them used to be good, but now due to a combination of factors we barely speak.\n\nRight now, I have been living at my parents' house for 4 months. As I left the country I was studying in with a hurry (and with the expectation to return), I still pay rent for a house that I do not stay in, and all my belongings remain there. I am extremely unhappy here, but also find myself unable to make any effort to change my current living circumstances and future plans. I am constantly feeling weak, tired and sad. I do not socialise even though my friends are making an effort to reach out to me. I ignore everything and everyone. I want to move back to the country where I did my postgraduate studies and find a way to get another offer for the PhD but cannot stop thinking that I am a massive failure. I am open to working in the industry for a while before this, but due to the exclusivity of the field in which I am interested as well as the visa requirements, there are very limited job opportunities for non-nationals and things look extremely bleak.\n\nI am currently trying to work towards finishing my thesis (which I was previously unable to). However, I cannot stop thinking about what has happened. I am in therapy. I take medication for ADHD as well as for my generalised anxiety and depression. Still, I feel like none of it helps. I am unable to focus, constantly sad, anxious and agitated. I resent myself as I fail to keep my promises. I have constant brain fog and struggle even hearing my own thoughts. I see no future and I am scared. I want to turn things around but have no idea what to do. How does one get out of bed in the morning without fearing life and failure?",

I just started to feel sad and lonely recently at everything that's been happening to me lately these past few days... Maybe it's just the inherent feeling of being constantly alone despite having people that actually loves me, or maybe it's just me making bad choices after bad choices when it comes to falling in love and a plethora of other things. Just to clarify I have a very loving mother and father that helped me get through these past few years. They're the main reason why I'm still standing to this day, and I love them dearly with all my heart. But after the pandemic, it just felt like nothing was the same anymore. It's hard to make a socially meaningful relationship with someone at my age just due to the fact that most of us just wants to get overstimulated with phones. I just feel alone all the time whenever I interact with the outside world. Even if I talk to a random stranger or help a random stranger, I just feel empty and dead inside even if I was smiling or seemed happy about those specific situations. I'm a religious type of guy but even though I have faith in the Lord, I just can't help but feel this emptiness inside of me whenever I'm with a group of people, especially with people at my age. When it comes to my attempts at romantic love, I just fail horribly because I always fall over girls that don't like me at all. It's gotten bad to the point where I just feel uncomfortable about myself and my surroundings whenever I'm on school because there's a specific girl that knows I like her, but clearly doesn't have an interest with me at all even though I give her my best of efforts. It takes a huge toll on my mental health and academics. My faith in the Lord tells me to wait patiently for a partner that I'll find someday, but I just can't help but feel lonely. It's selfish and I know that it's wrong but I just feel like this sometimes. It sucks. I just wish these thoughts would never wind up within my head but if I ignore them I know that they'll end up resurfacing one way or another. Anyways, hopefully by tommorow, whetever this is, is gone. Thank you for reading, sincerely and Godbless to whom it may concern",

I'm a big procrastinator and only this year I had the courage to say \"if not now, then never\" and finally started to dictate the events that were previously only in my mind. \n\nThe story is not original, which is almost impossible nowadays, but it is a little special to me, and I'm afraid of being disappointed if I do a bad job. I already have plans for another series that will be set in the same universe, but I've been thinking a lot about giving up. It sounds so silly and generic that I wonder where my head was when I first imagined it. I don't want to be a reference or super famous, but I want someone to have my saga as a favorite. I don't want to look back in a few years and think that I was an idiot for thinking that I could have done something good. \n\nI hate myself enough to know that if this book ever ends up on my shelf, I don't want to know that I wrote a piece of crap.

        "Text": "Would love some insight from anyone who experiences ocd or has experience working with it. \n\nMaybe my partner is just a bit of a “clean freak,” but I can’t help noticing things. \n\nA lot of it is cleaning related, but some of it is just perfectionism. She has a habit of redoing things from scratch constantly, when it comes to work or creative hobbies. If one thing slightly bothers her she has to scrap everything and start over. In the eyes of others she is talented and capable, but she can never be satisfied with her own work. She also routinely deletes everything off her phone and social media, discards a lot of her belongings and keeps almost zero sentimental items. We used to joke how she seemed like she was going to run away or was preparing to d*e or something because of how minimal she keeps her spaces.\n\nLately she has put more personal items in her room, which is really nice, but the task of arranging and displaying them just seems to constantly bother her and she has to rearrange her room layout often. Specifically when she is under stress or emotional duress, we’ll be in the middle of talking and she’ll suddenly be like, “hold on, I need to take down that shelf, it’s bothering me.”\n\nI am not the cleanest person, but I wouldn’t say I’m a slob, but I do get self-conscious about trying to clean things in our apartment because of how contrastingly meticulous she is. She sometimes will randomly get up and start cleaning in the middle of the night. Maybe this is just how she deals with stress, and I shouldn’t worry about her. Maybe it’s cathartic? I’ve tried to gently ask about it, just because I want to make sure she’s okay, but she brushes me off. \n\nIt isn’t to the point that it’s constant or keeping her from experiencing normal life, but I would still say it’s frequent enough that it sticks out to me. Sometimes this behavior worries me or stresses me out, but if meticulously cleaning or rearranging or getting rid of things is therapeutic for her then I don’t want to take that away from her. On the other hand, if this is a red flag that something could be going on, I want to help her.\n\nI have generalized anxiety disorder myself, and have spent many years managing it and learning about my own mental health. Still, I can sometimes be more sensitive to the moods and nervous energy of people around me, but I wouldn’t want to just assume and project my own neuroses onto her. Maybe she’s just a little bit particular about some things? I don’t know enough about ocd or other disorders to know if these behaviors are indicative of anything. She also was raised to believe that “mental issues” are something that makes you weak and should be overcome by sheer force of will, so I worry even if I bring it up she will just continue to shrug it off. We plan to spend the rest of our lives together, so I am simply worried for her long term well being. Should I be concerned by these behaviors? ",

I get ideas all the time but I just can't seem to actually follow through with them no matter how hard I try.\n \nEver since I started drawing consistently once I got a little older, I started uploading my art to an account online. I didn't draw all that much, so whenever I did, I would upload it for my friends to see. I drew because it felt cool to get to the end result, and to experience the fascination of being able to do art in the first place, I even got a lot of validation from it from a lot of people I respect, but the whole thing only feels tiresome to me now.\n\nFor the past year in between my successful and unsuccessful attempts, it feels as if I'm dragging a very heavy sandbag across to the finish line, wherein the only bliss is reaching it. I can't get myself to draw or finish a project no matter how hard I try. My adhd ass (real) just ends up being very easily distracted as the task is such an uphill battle, and I just don't end up doing it. This was never a problem before. I've tried powering through to just get something out a bunch of times to get into the momentum, and even though I'm able to do so without sacrificing on any qualitative aspects, it becomes very easy for me to not do the same thing again and I end up not drawing again for months.\n\nHalf the accounts I follow online even on socials are art accounts, and I consistently maintain various folders namely \"dynamic poses\", clothing reference\", \"lighting reference\", \"composition\", \"character design\", and the like. But when it comes to actually do something, I feel a thousand miles away and even imagining the process of me doing something tires me out.\n\nMy job is not being an illustrator, I work in video production and photography, but even those things have become slightly intimidating for me to do. I feel like I've given up as a person. It just fucks me up knowing that I can put out art everyday and go months feeling the guilt of not doing so. Everyone talks about how one draws not for anyone else's validation, not for this, not for that, but because the process is soothing to one's soul.\nIf the process isn't so enjoyable to me anymore despite me taking various long breaks, does that mean it's the end of the line?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my rant on a throwaway. I hope you have a good day.",

I want to feel like living again. Could it be that these dreams are telling me something or at the very least because I live such a dull miserable lifestyle that it's manifesting in some sort of form of restlessness?",

I used to not be this way, but the more time passes, the more true it becomes. \n\nTo paint the picture, I want to talk about my routine. Every day of the week except tuesday, I get up, shower, get dressed. I talk to my parents for a few minutes as I leave about anything that's important in our lives. I go to work, where I speak maybe a maximum of 50 words a day. I come home, talk to my parents about anything that's important or we forgot to mention in the morning, and relax in my room, usually reading or drawing, or playing a game, or watching a show. That's basically it. \n\nI'm not depressed, though everyone experiences changes in emotion, and I do get sad from time to time. I used to be far more depressed, mostly in part due to loneliness, and it's not like I've just \"grown used\" to that baseline level of sadness. I'm not suicidal, and I don't really have self destructive tendencies, or any of the other things I used to cope with my past depression. \n\nThe only exception to this routine is tuesdays, where I don't have to work, and it's generally my \"off\" day. I play ttrpgs with my friends, and since I'm the GM, I usually end up talking a ton, which almost entirely fills my \"social interaction\" quota or whatever. Honestly a lot of it is just joking and messing around, and these weekly hangouts mean the world to me. But here comes the problem, they're all I need. Period. Anything else is far too much. \n\nI don't really want to hang out with people, I don't want to go places, especially not for the whole day. Especially because my job doesn't pay too well, and I'd rather work to save up. I honestly find my shitty job more fulfilling than hanging out with people. I of course text people online a lot, mostly people I know irl, and that helps my buffer too. But I just feel crazy when I have to drag myself to go to a party or to hang out with people, when I'd be perfectly happy going to work instead. And it's definitely a lot worse at the moment, since I've been dealing with some things in my personal life (nothing bad), which lead to me getting significantly less sleep, which means I have less energy to be with people. \n\nI feel so guilty when I make up excuses to not be with people when I'm just working or relaxing at home. I love the people in my life, but I don't know how many \"I just don't want to be around people right now\" excuses they can take. I'm dating someone right now and I know I shouldn't be, because I'm not really a romantic, and hanging out with them sucks; I hate just lazing around doing nothing, and I don't have the energy to go and do something. When we started dating, that thing going on in my life hadn't started, so I had more time to spend, but now I just don't. I love them but I want to put us on pause for a while, but also I do want to see them more and do things. I just don't think I have it in me. \n\nBut also this whole situation is just how I feel, how I've always felt to some extent, and I truly wish I wasn't. I wish I could be more social, could be the life of the party or whatever, but it's just not possible. I don't really know what I'm looking for here. It's mostly just a vent, but if anyone feels the same, or knows people like me, that'd help a lot. Or coping strategies are also nice. Thanks.",

Our aunt is schizophrenic and I think my parents are having a hard time taking my brother to see a doctor because they are afraid he will be diagnosed with it too. I, myself suffer from anxiety also so severely that before I was able to find a way to ground myself I would throw up and see white when having a panic attack. Has anyone ever experienced something similar or has known someone to experience something similar. I am trying to get my brother to see his PCP at least and get my parents to understand that he needs help controlling his anxiety and if it is another type of mental illness he needs help regardless.  \n\nThank you all I would appreciate any advice or experiences ",

        "Title": "How Good People Can Protect Themselves from Negative Influences and Stay on the Right Path in Today’s World",
        "Upvotes": 0,
        "Text": "In today’s world, the influence of aggressive behavior, bad habits, and negativity is growing rapidly, especially with the impact of social media and certain trends that glorify these qualities. For those trying to live with integrity, it can be challenging to stay on a positive path and protect themselves, as well as their families, from falling into traps set by bad influences. This issue is especially important for youth, who are often the most affected by these pressures. So, how can we stay strong, stay safe, and make the right choices?\n\n1. Build Strong Morals and Well-Mannered Behavior: The first step to protecting yourself is to develop a strong moral foundation. When you know what you stand for, it becomes easier to resist peer pressure and avoid actions that compromise your values. Kindness, respect, and honesty act as shields that help you to make choices that are true to yourself, regardless of outside influences.\n\n\n2. Stay Alert and Choose Company Wisely: Being mindful of the people you surround yourself with is crucial. Negative company can have a powerful impact, even if you don’t realize it at first. Bad influences often start subtly, so stay alert to red flags like gossip, manipulation, or encouragement of harmful behaviors. Good friends will support your growth; toxic ones will only pull you down.\n\n\n3. Practice Spirituality (Not Necessarily Religion): Spirituality can provide a powerful sense of inner peace, grounding, and purpose. It helps you see beyond the immediate material or social pressures and find strength within. Practices like meditation, mindfulness, and introspection allow you to reflect on what’s important, stay true to your path, and resist external negativity.\n\n\n4. Focus on Personal Growth: Seek hobbies, activities, or interests that encourage personal growth. Whether it’s reading, learning new skills, or engaging in fitness, these positive outlets keep you focused on self-improvement and away from harmful influences. Remember, growth often happens gradually, but every step you take in a positive direction strengthens your resilience.\n\n\n5. Communicate Openly with Family: Keeping open communication with family members can also be a protective factor. Share your concerns, your struggles, and your achievements. When family bonds are strong, they become a support system that can help you resist negative influences and stay on track.\n\n\n6. Stay Mindful of Social Media Influence: Social media often glorifies aggressive and harmful behaviors, creating a distorted view of reality. Limit your exposure to content that promotes negative behavior and follow positive influencers who inspire you toward good values, growth, and positivity. Being mindful of the content you consume can help you keep a clear and focused mind.\n\n\n\nStaying true to yourself in a world filled with negativity isn’t easy, but by building strong values, staying alert to potential influences, and leaning on spirituality for guidance, you can protect yourself from harm. Empower yourself to make positive choices not only for your own well-being but also to set a positive example for others in your family and community. When we support one another in choosing the right path, we build a society that values respect, kindness, and integrity.",

        "Text": "Hello. I wanted to talk about one thing. Every time I feel bad about something, even if it's small, I blame myself and tend to make the problem bigger. I feel like I feel too much and too deeply. When I argue with someone, when something goes wrong, I feel like sabotaging myself. The first thing I always think about is taking my pills. I am currently taking clonazepam, the lowest dose (0,5), but even 2 grams doesn't do anything for me. I would like to take more to the point of not feeling anything. There was a time when I was in a virtual relationship and as stupid as it may seem, this person ghosted me and I really miss them, I miss them so much. We talked for three years. I'm always thinking about doing some kind of harm to myself, mainly to stop feeling this thing. I want to stop feeling so guilty and that I'm always the one who doesn't deserve anything. Therapy hasn't worked for me. I've been to three therapists over the past few years. I'd like to hear some opinions, please? My last diagnosis was agoraphobia, depression and anxiety. Now I'm trying to see if they accept me in an addiction center (because they are in high demand), so I can have free therapy since I'm unemployed, and the psychiatrist who sees me there helps me a little but it's minimal. I take an antidepressant in the morning and clonazepam at night, I was also prescribed sodium valproate and risperidone but I don't take them. I'm a little scared of the side effects of these, but I'm starting to considerate risperidone. I want something that will make me sleep. I once tried to take more grams of clona than I should have and ended up vomiting and feeling unbalanced. I said I wouldn't do it again to my mom, but honestly I really want to do it again. I want to sleep and not wake up. Sometimes I even force myself to sleep so I don't have to spend the day or think about things that make me feel bad, Even if I'm not sleepy and I have a headache, sometimes I even wake up shaking. I'm pathetic, and there are days when I try my best to be okay, but I feel absolutely alone. I love my family but I still feel alone. And I don't have any friends because I always end up  pushing them away for some reason. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I don't think I'll ever get better. My life is empty, my heart is empty. I just feel like living is so painful. ",

She said I have a lot of the symptoms since my mood shifts extremely quick between one day being extremely depressed to the next day being extremely happy. I typically have mainly manic episodes but when I first developed mental issues they were mixed episodes. \nShe said that it’s something that she has noticed. I think it might exhibit as that because I am medicated meaning when I do have manic episodes they are more tam. \nThey use to be very bad now they aren’t which is good. She just said I had a lot of symptoms but that doesn’t mean I have it. \nThe thought of being misdiagnosed is like freaking me out. Being bipolar at this point is apart of my identity I don’t go around being like oh look at me I’m bipolar. It took a lot of time to accept that I have this and it’s something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. Like just imagine coming to terms with the fact that I have these mixed episodes where I lose grip of reality and hurt myself. So the thought that is possibly could be something else freaks me out. She said it sounds like it but I don’t have it but putting that thought in my head is not good.\nI’m just having a weird crisis rn  ik I’m still bipolar I’ve been diagnosed for about 4 years. But if I’m not I’d have to come to terms with that then come to turns with something else and I just needed to vent because it’s freaking me out and weirdly my journal won’t help me I think. ",

I used to love my life, I valued my happiness and wellbeing very highly, then when she dumped me for being too comfortable, I lost all of it.\n\nI saw that failure as a wake up call to get in shape, and I even resorted to taking steroids in order to become muscular and fit like the guys who she found attractive and that get approached by women at bars.\n\nI began to self isolate for 3 years and thought of myself as not enough and all of my dating and flirting knowledge went out the window and I who was once really cool, confident, etc became unable to talk to women, and if they did find me attractive I would blow it because I became attached too quickly. \n\nNow, I am in great shape and have muscles and abs after changing to being natural and off of steroids, but when I go into social settings like bars I have crippling anxiety to the point that my mind goes blank and I refuse to approach anyone.\n\nRecently, a girl from my gym who said I was her gym crush and I went on a few dates and after a few dates that seemed to go very well escalating towards something real, she dumped me. \n\nJust tonight I went out for my friend’s birthday, and his girlfriend brought her friend who is also single and they wanted me to talk to her and I literally couldn’t bring myself to because I was too nervous she wasn’t into me. Then I saw guys around me having women approach them and I began to give up entirely because not a single one approached me, nor did the girl they tried to set me up with. She wouldn’t even acknowledge my existence.\n\nI feel defeated entirely, I feel incapable of being loved, I feel broken, and I feel like I’m less than every other guy on earth. I’ve been hurt by too many people, I’ve let down too many people, and I feel like unwanted trash. \n\nAll I want is someone to value me and to mean something to someone and I can’t even get that so I feel like a waste of air that’s pretty much guaranteed to die alone.

Since the beginning of 2023, I feel like the quality of my life has begun spiralling - we were called back to the office, I've been having issues connecting with people, I've recently received a terrible performance review at work, my family members I was playing games with have been called back to the office, too, so I talk to them maybe quarterly(I live in a different state from all members of my immediate family).  On top of all of this, we had to put down my first dog earlier this year and it was so quick I don't feel like I got to properly say goodbye and come to peace with it.\n\nIt's just all been horrendous.  I'd rather not be around people, I don't enjoying going places like I did pre-covid, there is a growing rift between myself and my family.  It's just been a horrible few years, I feel like I'd rather be back in lockdown - I feel empty/hollow.  Am I strange for feeling this way?  Does anyone else have a similar experience?  ",

I can go into my thoughts so much that I will assign something/someone as fake or real, bad and good, etc and this relates back to my first topic of even after I am proved wrong again and again I tend to still believe I am right and I have a superior judgement \n\nI've also thought about narcissism but I have STRONG feelings of empathy for people/situations/things that I assign good in my head. For people who may have an opposite opinion then me I feel little to no empathy and maybe a bit of disgust(?)\n\nI switch moods INSANSELY fast, it depends on the people I am around since I'm extremely combative when around people I have not placed under good/bad (usually family members), my moods normally change from positive to negative rather then negative to positive (it does still happen!)\n\nthese are not even a 10th of my symptoms but I feel insane thinking about this and want to get a therapist, any thoughts?\n\n*(I just realized I had put bpd instead of bipolar in the last post, I'm anxious right now and I got them mixed up, sorry!!!! bpd is something I'm interested in but not as much as bipolar disorder, again sorry!)*",

The other teens with me had similarly positive experiences, but I have no way to contact them.\n\nI was saddened to find exclusively negative experiences in wilderness from other redditors.  I made a post in a more related subreddit looking for people with a similar experience to me to talk about it with and maybe share what was helpful, but I was only met with insults saying I’m brainwashed, bragging, pushing an agenda, and trying to invalidate their negative experiences. I’m not trying to invalidate anyone’s experiences I’m just wondering if I’m the only one, or if the help me and my peers got was valid.",

Bit of a trauma baby. I have been through some lows growing up and even to this day. I always see the light in everything. Although I cannot see the light in myself. I have trouble advocating for myself because I never think I’m good enough. I don’t know where everything went wrong but I know it majority had to do with my parents growing up. Life was great when we lived in an urban neighborhood. We moved out to an area in 4th grade that was more rural with barely any diversity. I went from having tons of friends to just a few. Pair that with my parents both being very mentally unstable and it’s as if I lost out on a lot developmental opportunities. To this day I cannot laugh. Nothing, like legit nothing makes me laugh. Never has either. I’ve been thinking back to my preteen days and even when I was younger I still don’t remember laughing. I can “laugh” along with someone, but you’ll never hear me be the first to laugh. I would hold in my laughter growing up because I was feared of being outed, yelled at, or hit. Also would get told my laugh was weird from my mom. Everything I did was analyzed and commented on. All this has created extreme social anxiety as an adult causing me to come off as rude and short but really it’s just me thinking in my head about how much this person doesn’t like me. I self sabotage quite often. I’m a very good looking guy and have high confidence but get uncomfortable when I can tell someone is attracted to me. It’s like they’re not paying attention but just gazing into my soul.  I don’t mind if the feeling is reciprocated. Not that I’m actually looking to date. I don’t find myself worthy enough for anyone and believe that no one would be able to tolerate all my weird flaws and feelings. \n\nRant over. Could keep going, but who’s really listening?

(This is gunna be LONG because I have ADHD and I wanna get all the details out)\n\nI've been in a 13 year long relationship with my fiance (we met when we were in high school and started dating in my senior year. I love this man to bits and I can't see myself with anyone else (we jokingly say that our joined anxiety is what made us work so hard on this relationship).\n\nWhen we first started getting intimate (I am waiting till I'm married before giving away my V-Card and he completely respects that {another reason why I love this man} but we have been active in other ways) he would always initiate and wouldn't push me to do things to him even after he would do things to me (in the intimate sense). I've initiated too but couldn't get around to doing HJs or BJs with him. I had never done them before him (he was my first serious relationship). I was still very needy with him and horny, and we were active but I was receiving more then giving (he would often tell me that he was okay with that as I was still learning/recovering from trauma).\n\nIn recent years my libido has been literally thin to non-existent and I have no idea why, and I haven't been sexually attracted to him even to receiving from him. I love this man to death and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him and yet I can't understand what is happening to me. I've been in Therapy for 6 years and my therapist believes its just a part of my life where I'm not interested but...I doubt that's it.\n\nPeople I've talked to about it think \"oh he's not the one for you if you're not turned on by him\" or something like that but I know deep down that that isn't true at all. I see myself with this man for the rest of my life when I thought (for the longest time before I met this man) I would be alone for the rest of my life (and being fine with that). I admittedly thought for the longest time I was asexual but I know now that I'm demiromantic. I want kids with this man and I wanna grow old together with him (and he does too, we've talked about it).\n\nHere's what's been going on in our life;\n\nMain Note: I have severe depression and anxiety and am taking Vyvanse, Lexapro and Wellbutrin. And I have P.O.T.S (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). I also have a BC implant.\n\n1.) He is the sole caregiver of his 90 year old grandmother. We don't go out as a result as we have to find someone to look after her if we want to. We love this woman but she can be a handful lol. I work as a store clerk and he doesn't/can't work save for taking care of his grandmother and his online business of flipping vintage toys. Money is tight around here. Thankfully we live in his grandma's house and don't pay rent TwT.  \n  \n2.) I just moved into his house recently (in the last year) after living with my folks my whole life until now (I'm 31). I was emotionally abused by my controlling mom and my autistic sister (I'm of the opinion it was unintentional but I don't know) and I am very empathic. My fiance has been my rock from when we first met and he still today.\n\n3.) Because of the abuse I dealt with, I was a bit of a pack rat and I'm still going through a lot of my things that my fiance has in a storage unit. Our house is too small for all of our things.\n\nThat's about it; if I missed anything, I'll edit and add more. Go ahead and ask me whatever. I just...I have no idea what is happening with me and my mind/body.\n\nIs there something wrong with me?",

        "Upvotes": 3,
        "Text": "It all started in the 2nd grade of elementary school, at first I was teased, mostly by one girl who no one gave a shit about, but when she made me cry in the 3rd grade of elementary school, everyone immediately realized that I was a great choice for a victim, and then it all started. It's not like I was bullied by a lot of people, no, only 3-5 people (I don't remember exactly). I was hardly ever hit (a couple of times in the stomach over five years), and it's not like their bullying methods were somehow unique, everything was standard: they spat in my backpack, kicked it, played football with it, hid it, threw it somewhere. Then they started intimidating me, like: yeah, I'm going to give it to you now (and nothing happened), they would walk around jumping out from around corners (they knew that I was very afraid of sudden movements and loud sounds), they would come up with \"funny\" things about me. Then they started pushing me into girls' toilets, and they started stealing my food. Later I transferred to another school, it was after high school (where there were the same people). There the first two classes everything was calm (at least in comparison with what was in the first) a little teasing, but in general tolerable, since there was another victim, and since I already had a bitter experience, I myself began with them, if not to bully, then at least to stand next to them, since again I REALLY did not want to be a victim (for which I am actually ashamed now) but then the victims transferred to other schools (and I was already quite careful in communication) and perhaps somehow quietly and imperceptibly checking me, they realized that I was quite suitable for the role of a victim. And it began ... Everything was as if according to the script, just like in the first school, but unlike the first they did not beat me, although they hissed at my ear, and poked me in the body with fingers. Even though it was only one year, I will remember it for the rest of my life (I still often have nightmares about these bastards). The difference here is that in the second school, I was left completely alone, I had no friends, not even buddies, even the teachers didn't give a damn about me, which probably affected me more than 5 years of bullying in my previous school. And so I transferred to college, and finally I got to a place where I didn't have any bullying, but despite this, 8 years of this hell could not help but affect my psyche. Moreover, these consequences did not begin to appear right away. First, hatred for these bastards who laughed at me, then hatred for myself for not fighting back, then a (not frequent) desire appeared to lynch these people (I put it as mildly as I could). Then I started having trouble sleeping, then anxiety, then social phobia, then apathy, and finally depression. Now I'm being treated by a psychiatrist, and it seems to be gradually getting better, but this disgusting past still haunts me, it won't let me go, I still have nightmares about these scumbags, that it's all starting again, the fear that they'll laugh at me, the fear that I'll ever see these people again in my life. I still don't have any friends, and here I am on Reddit, writing this through Google translate, which is why this text is very illiterate, because I'm too lazy to learn English. In general, it was very hard for me to write this (I think you understand why), I wanted to talk it out somewhere, and cry about it somewhere.",

What if it ate the wires and the landlord had to come and fix it and the landlord found something she didn't like that I did. What if it bit one of the cats. What if it died and my mom blamed me for the bad smell and we had tear everything up to find it.\n\nI began looking around for clues that there was a mouse. I checked inside the couch, the wood was a little bit mutilated. I heard creaking sounds.\n\nI took some ashwagandha gummies to calm myself down. Just the recommended dose whenever needed does wonders for my anxiety. I don't know of it is the best thing to do, but it helps me. I am not recommending anyone to take or not, do your own research and do what is best for you.\n\nOnce it kicked in, I went into a more rational thought pattern. The creaking sounds were just my house make old house noises. My house is older than my town, it is of course going to make noise. The mutilated wood? -I used to pick at the wood. Looking at it now, that is exactly what it looks like. Not mouse bites. The original noise, was just fluid or whatever moving in my ear since I had been resting on it. I am getting over the flu so my ears are either popping randomly or not popping at all. The same noise had happened ealier that say.\n\nOverthinking can really mess with someone's rational thinking. Hell, I don't even have a reason for slipping into it. It doesn't help that you can almost always find validation for the bad thought process. Like the slightly mutilated wood. Like why do I do this to myself.",

But I believe it is normal for me to react this way because I did extremely humiliating things that warrant such a reaction. \n\nThe problem is is that my friends say I \"paranoid and always blow things out of proportion\" and my therapist says that this is \"OCD, incorrect thinking, etc.\" Although I love my friends and therapist and don't think they are intentionally gaslighting me, what I believe is going on is that everything I am thinking is TRUE (especially if I smoke weed because I can realize things that my normal state of consciousness does not realize, and many times I have confirmed my thoughts to be TRUE), and that me telling myself that I'm just \"paranoid\" or \"OCD\" is just gaslighting myself to make my situation feel less bad than it is or just to pretend people don't hate me/im cancelled etc. To rephrase, it is like someone who DID do bad things/humiliated themselves/is in a horrible situation, but just telling themselves \"oh im just paranoid or its OCD\" to gaslight themselves to not realize the true severity of the situation. \n\nAnother way I can describe this is people giving me general blanket advice like \"ohh no you are just overreacting it's not that bad\" \"it's just OCD\" \"oh people don't actually think about you as much as you think they do\" but I believe that this is just generic blanket advice that does not apply to my life. \n\nIt feels like my friends think I have bad thinking behaviors, but I know it's not true. Does anyone else deal with this?",

I always feel so ashamed because I’ve never met someone that cries as much as me. I cry in public, in my car, because I genuinely can’t hold it in. And the responses to my cries are like 50/50, some people are SUPPER sweet and hug me, asking if I’m okay. And like some responses are like mocking me. And i feel like it’s so rare to see people cry, like idk maybe this is a dumb take but why can people smile in public and feel no shame but crying in public is seen as shameful? They’re both emotions.",

I am an teenage girl so im growing up Or maybe i just stopped growing and started to root. In school all the guys gets just taller, stronger. Im stuck 5'6. They're always so better. They don't have to deal with periods every month. They don't have to worry about getting pregnant. Getting harrased. There is many woman getting k!lled in my country and it bothers me so much. They're always seen as on another level. I hate being seen as weak, vulnerable or anything. I can carry heavy things like they can. Yet im still being seen as weak. I am the always fatigue one that could shatter into pieces. I look weak because im 5'6. I have to sit my legs crossed. I must have kids in the future. I must give my control to men. I must be the submissive one. In history class i hardly ever see a women. I see women that can't go to school, work anything. Why? They have to farm babies. I love chess so much. Seeing the men and woman split like why? WHY? Okay i understand the strength, the sports. Fine i get man stronger biologically but even strategy? Don't we just use brain?\n\nI look into myself in the mirror asking why im not just a cis man?\n\nTo fix my dear mental health i go to swimming even there i sometimes feel uncomfortable and i hate thinking about it. When i look at myself mirror again i imagine myself tall, muscular, very short hair, no breasts, fit...Nope it's never going to happen. \nAlso to get stronger and since i want to walk at night. Instead of getting a pepper spray i will learn self defence so im going to start boxing in a month. I just wish to get taller so much like im very insecure about it. At least can i be 170 cm ? No i just don't want my height to stop growing. Please...Even though i do all of that I don't think i will love my gender whatever i do. There is a feeling inside me and that feeling is always appear. \n\nYeah before i just write my endless thoughts i wants to make things clear.\nI am so tired of society. It even disrespects even to private part. I don't want to say that disgusting word or hear it. I never wanted to hate my gender but society made me hate it a lot. I thought about su!cide but i know that's not an solution to it and that's the reason i started to go swimming. However it bothers me so much and I can't stop thinking about it. I can't be happy with the body given to me. \n\nNot sure how good this post is. i just wanted to share with people to know about what i feel. I really want people to comment on my post if they feel like me. If they have some empathy inside them. Thank you for reading.",

Nope, medicine? Yes not working dosnt do shit, parents suporting me? Pfff you fucking wish, a bf? Yes but whats the help if i dont want to share how i truly feel with him? Im too much of a dissapointment to tell him \"i lasted 2 months without a razor in my hand\". 2 months of being clean. 2 fucking months of torment, bugs under my skin, cockroaches ON MY FUCKING BODY. And what? Nobody fucking wants to help with that. It started small, a little iching, then came the feeling of ant legs-like, then the Antennas of the bugs, then the biting. I know theres no bugs, i dont see any but does my mind care? Fuck no. And my psychiatrist? Dosnt belive its mentall issiues, my neurologist? dosnt belive its my nerves. THEN WHAT IS IT!? what is it then? Whys noone helping me? Im just a kid, i want to have a future. But with every cut, every fucking scrach, i loose hope, i found out that when im cut the bugs go away a little, not fully. Maybe its the pain taking my attention away? I dont know, theyr still here, right now, Its 2 am god please i just want to be normal, i want to be happy and loved. Why cant i do anything abaut it? Why am i so powerless to my own mind and body? Theres so much qestions i would ask god if he just listened to my prayers. Is this a punishent for a bad last life? The fact that my own body feels like its rejecting my soul? Is it the soul, the body, the mind? Its not hormonal teen stuff. No teen is normally afraid of theyr own mind are they? And the worst part is, the only escape i see is ending it all. And guess what, im too much of a pussy to do it. What if theres no bliss and happines after, what if its just darkness, nonexistance, dissapoitment. What if i regret it half way tru? If i have to die, why cant it be sooner, when i need it? Not when i dont want to. I just want to be happy thats all, thats too much to ask is it. It dosnt just wait around the corner after all, thats not how life is in this fucked up word. Fucked up world or just me? Maybe both but people say hope is the thing that keeps us together. What if im loosing it? Im a lesser person? Less human? I guess i am. And what if i am? What if i always knew my life wont be easy?

Rationally I know this is the consequence of smoking for so long. \n\nI should be motivated and focused, but all I feel is being under control; I feel trapped and pushed into something I don't want. \n\nI've read thousands of pages on how to quit, make a change and better my life.

I visit her 1 x a month and it gets worse in a way as time goes on because I know she has probably 10 years max until she cannot really interact with us anymore or dies. And anyone who is my age or older knows how fast 10 years go by.\n\nShe is the only one of my (huge) family with many siblings that accepts me as I am with all my weird features, I can talk with her for hours about even topics like politics, she listens so well and is invested in my life like no one else, and also is introverted like me when it comes to crazy family parties.\n\nI just know it will be devastating when she won’t even be there anymore and although it should make me enjoy the time with her more, it kinda ruins it because all I think of is her death coming soon.\nSince this is an ongoing problem, I wonder if there are any other solutions than „enjoy the time with her“ because I am trying but there doesn’t seem a solution. \n\nI remember as a kid I had that fear too, but the next day kinda calmed me down knowing this is too far away to become reality. Now it is not and this is not making it easier.\n\nThank you for your help and thoughts.\n\n",

I've always felt like the blackest of black sheep with them, but since moving out, I've felt it even more.\n\nMy only best friend lives 200 miles up north and though I speak to her every single day, I don't like to burden her with my problems and there's not too much she can do from a distance. I don't have any other friends, especially none in my city and I'm too socially awkward to get or make any. \nI don't have a job because of my anxiety, I'm currently doing a college course but that is the only contribution to trying to better my life I am doing. I also feel like getting a job is hard because of my mental headspace.\n\nI find it difficult to keep my flat tidy, I struggle to motivate myself to do the basic things within it too. I pretty much have to force myself to clean or do the dishes and I don't even do that everyday. I can't bring myself out of the mentality that nobody sees it but me, so why do I need to bother. I don't have the money to make it look decent and yet my family moan about the fact it looks shit despite barely coming here. \n\nI had therapy last year but I feel the frustrations and feelings that I tried to deal with have found their way back. I don't find things like that to be a long term solution and I don't see the point of going back for more.\n\n\"Mental health walks\" do very little to help me. I find things like meditation absolutely useless. Distractions only last so long and being in my flat just frustrates me further about being alone there (though I do have a cat). I don't have spare money to do things to treat myself, and not many interesting things are free. \n\nI'm just frustrated and I feel like I don't know how to change it anymore. It all feels a bit hopeless nowadays.\n\nI feel very alone at the moment.",

My partner (M30) knows, we've worked through it with great effort and I never relapsed. I'm fully committed to being faithful and honest.\n\nI can give as many excuses as to why it happened, but I'm not trying to justify my actions, only to leave them behind.\n\nMy problem is, it's still an arousing thought. Not the cheating (I actually feel quite bad when I think about getting involved), but the fetish itself. I don't want it, I'd actually really like to not consume porn at all... Which I found out is way harder to stop than expected, so I keep watching these cheating scenarios. I feel like they're directly responsible for the following...\n\nWhat brought me here are actually the dreams: from time to time I dream about cheating on him with strangers and in the end of the dream I always get caught. They're never fun dreams, and I wake up sad and miserable until I realise I didn't fuck up again.\nI hoped time would make my guilt lighter, but 5 years after it the only thing I don't carry anymore is the temptation. Although these dreams fill me with the fear that I'd be ridiculously easy to seduce (in the sense that I'm not afraid of me myself approaching anyone with the intention of sleeping with them) and I'd have no willpower to resist any advances.\n\nPlease, I understand my crimes are big. But I'm honest to God trying to be a good partner, so if you could resist insulting me or telling me to break up with him it'd be very nice.",

I was on Prozac for a year but didn't find any benefit, I've tried therapy a few times without success, and I should probably give it another chance because why not.  My 8 year old wiener dog has been keeping me alive for his entire life. \n\nI have no memories and I have minimal functional short term memory. It's incredibly difficult for me to understand what someone is telling me, unless they're using slow, simple speech. I'm unable to do any mental math. I spend my time googling and chatgpting how to improve my critical thinking and memory, but my mind always draws a blank. When it comes to focusing, I don't have any. I bounce in my chair and get side tracked on random stuff. \n\nI somehow got through nursing school. Every day as a nurse was a struggle and I barely manage to get by. It's getting hard to fake as I'm coming up on my 2 years and I should know a lot of these things. My dream is to be able to recall and verbalize memories/information so I could make friends and to be the best nurse. \n\nI've rewritten and reorganized each of these sentences I've written multiple times and it still feels wrong. I know Reddit might be the last place for advice but.. I was hoping someone somewhere out there could maybe relate, share some thoughts on what's wrong with me? What should my next steps be?",

He lost his father that previous december and a group of his school friends and a few of my group wanted to do something nice for him an go away for a day, looked gun and good on my side so i rung up the dude who organized it and asked him at what time he wanted to plan it. He told me 16:00 hour, i asked if we couldnt go at the beginning of the afternoon. Im a farmer and they were planning it at a 1,5 hour drive from my farm, and at 16 i need to feed the animals. “No” was the answer, so i said sure im verh sorry but than i cant go. There wer still like many friends going and i hadnt spoken to my friend (b) in more than 7 or 8 months. When i text him he never responds or takes my phone calls. I just assumed he doesnt like me that much.\nSo my other friend (a) was angry with me and started a text rampage to me while i was at the other side of the world about what a bad friend i am. That really hurt me, it still does today. I care deeply for everyone i consider my friends and I hate it when i cant help one of ‘m. So it just hit me really hard that somebody would even consider calling me a bad friend. #aitah\n\nThan a few weeks later we moved my grandmother on my mothers side. She got a nice new appartement in the old folks home, died a week later. It was very sad even though she was 81 my mother is a tough one but she was defistated.\n\nApril\nA friend of my family, a man caled peter also died. Peter and his wife wer long time friends of my parents, they known eachother since they were in their 20’s. They have 3 sons whom my sister and my knew beter than our cousins, we spent many vacations, birthday partys and new years eves with each other. By a bit of luck we met on curacao a few weeks before, those memorys will allways stay in my heart.\nPeter just turned 61 his oldest son is about to marry and is expecting his first born. He was a great man.\n\nJuly\nMy grandmother on my fathers side had to get rushed to hospital for a knee surgery. It kept hurting and she kept nagging about it, so my father and aunt told her to go to the hospital. The surgery was a succes, she got a new knee and had to recover in an recovery home. My grandfather passed away a few years ago and she couldnt have taken care of her self. After a few days in the home with a few, ill be honest, anoying vissits from me and the rest of the family, my grandmother on fathers side died.\nI loved her verh much, even though she was not the easiesy grandma. It was all just so much i wanted it to be over. All of it\n\nLast year i propossed to my gf and we were planning on marrying in 2025 but our heads were never in the right place this year. ",

Every time I hear them (I have to walk past their room to leave my room) I have a panic attack and begin to not want to be touched or even looked at my either of them. While my sister was at home with us (who is older by two years) she would try to calm me down but it wouldn’t work. My mother would come out to calm me down and every time I would push her away and scream at her to not touch me. Due to my OCD whenever hearing them my brain would constantly tell me that they are doing that because they hate me, they are replacing me, I am the problem. They never loved me etc and at the age of 8 this is very difficult to understand. I had the unfortunate circumstance of knowing what sex was at the age of 5 (I will not go into why as even thinking about it makes me want to vomit.)\n\nSkip to two years ago, while at university, 2022, I was SAed by an ex boyfriend and now if I hear my parents it really destroys me. I have self harmed over it and told them repeatedly to maybe close the door or inform me earlier so I can mentally prepare. My mother does understand how traumatic it can be for someone who has gone through something that can’t be described, but my father (who knows I have been assaulted) doesn’t care and will actively do it while I am awake and not care. This is the same man that will complain and insult me for the way I look and rip me to shreds for the way I present myself and  how I never leave the house. He actively talks about having sex with his wife while I am there. I live in fear of weekends and moving out is not an option at the moment. Trust me if I could I’d already be gone. We have a dog and she is used as a way to keep me at home (father will not let me find a job to take care of a 2 year old dog and if I protest that I want a life away from this I am spat at and told I am vermin)  If I remind them politely to maybe talk about that when I’m not in the room I get insulted, or my mental state is brought up and I’m ridiculed for being neurodivergent.\n\nSex now, repulses me. I do have a boyfriend and he is well aware and understands incredibly the amount of pain that act can cause. I am on a waiting list for therapy and the police are involved with the ex as the assault was bad enough I had to go to the doctors. My trauma around sex has at times made it even difficult to be in a room with men. I just don’t think this trauma will ever leave and even writing this out makes me cold and shiver.",

I became crying and feeling like I was 6 feet underground trying to breathe, but I was choking and passing out every minute, but I would never die. That's how life feels to me and how it felt for awhile. When I went to bed I started watching something that I would consider funny at any different occasion, but I didn't feel nothing. After 2 hours I started crying again and all of my friendships started becoming unreal to me. I felt like I was invincible thinking about how people left me, didn't talk to me, didn't initiate anything and okay those things happen, but my tantrum wasn't so strong, because I felt that now, I went back in my head to the moment I was 12 years old crying every day, because all my friends left me, didn't want me, abandoned me. I remembered how unsafe, crushed and cold I felt and I felt that again today after 9 years. I felt that I am alone in all this, I felt so vulnerable, I felt like a miserable child that I was that 9 years ago, how all my childhood nobody wanted to be my friend, nobody loved me or gave me any sort of sympathy. I couldn't stop crying and shaking. Those feelings were so deep and sincere that I really thought I am invincible, that everyone forgot about me for ever and that I am really alone. I was in such strong emotions that only a few sips of vodka helped me think clearly that yeah maybe I am alone, and I am nobody's favourite, but I shouldn't care that deeply that I am dying inside, crying and throwing fits. Nothing like that has happened to me in at least 8 years and I was terrified of that. I'm 21 years old, I am a man, I forgot how strong emotions even feel besides anger. I know it was probably my trauma that made me so emotional, but that was the worst experience ever. I attend therapy, but I never thought that I could re-live those moments exactly how they were, especially as I forgot about all those emotions and loneliness I felt years ago and had totally different reactions for feeling lonely now.

Things have been going well, I have been very emotional and, although it’s been hard, my brain has been making new pathways linking to positive experiences, and challenging my core beliefs I have from the trauma that makes me mentally unwell. It’s a very strange process that has started to show some benefit now. \n\nIt is worth noting that I am not officially diagnosed with anything, I believed for a few years I had BPD which now I believe has been C-PTSD due to how I interpret the world and feel from trauma.\nMy therapist is a psychologist who used to work in diagnostic services- he keeps using the phrase complex PTSD and Complex Trauma so he believes I match the criteria for a diagnosis but can’t clinically do this. \n\nAnyway, during this seventh/eighth session, I was getting very emotional as I had a series of flashbacks of the past 4 years of my life flash in front of my eyes, every one I knew, places I associate with this time in my life and dark moments all came flooding in at once exactly like one of those flip books with all of these images.\n\nDuring the last eye movements, this flood of images happened again until I heard a loud ringing/frequency pitch and my mind went blank. I went into an absolute trance state and had an out of body experience where I completely dissociated from my body following the finger movements. \nOnce they stopped and the therapist spoke to me, my eyesight carried on forward in a trance, my body was completely tensed up and I couldn’t move, I wanted to speak but couldn’t or even find the words, my throat closed up and I was genuinely frozen in dissociation- I wasn’t reacting to any stimuli at all.\nThis lasted for about 20 seconds until I could talk and I started shaking uncontrollably everywhere and was really shaken up, my voice was unsteady and I was in complete auto pilot mode watching myself speak and act whilst trying to ground myself. I stood up and my legs were unable to move for a time I was rooted and frozen in place.\n\nI am venting a bit here as it was quite intense but has anybody else had anything similar to this or any comments to add?\nThe only thing I can compare it to is a high dose of mushrooms or LSD or even ketamine, and I had this feeling at the time that it was like some DID alter witch where something snapped in me and I left the present and reality with myself.",

For the past years, I've been working on myself. 2 years ago I hit a bottom, I don't want to call it depression because I never went to a psychiatrist but my moral was like a roller coaster, one week I felt somewhat fine and the other like absolute shit. I got out of this situation the moment I realized I could be liked and that I wasn't a horrible person. Life is hard but there's good side too.  \nBut now I'm still facing another problem, I can't have any faith in myself. In work, I always feel like I've done nothing, or it's bad. I feel the same with relation, people would thanks me but I don't see why should I be thanked when I could have done more.  It's straining, in a way I want to be more but I became lazy and start hating myself for it, I feel like a failure.\nSo how do I stop focusing on what I'm not and look at what I've done well. I can't find a solution and online resources didn't guided me at all. Thanks for reading :)",

        "Text": "Hello! So I was diagnosed with a cyst on my left frontal lobe and everything has been so confusing since then. Most recently I was trying to get diagnosed with ADHD because I have a lot of symptoms, specially executive disfunction. But it all went south when I had an EEG, the person in charge told me I had to fall asleep for the exam, so my ignorant self did every possible thing to fall asleep in the middle of the day, including moving from time to time. I didn't know the important thing was to stay still. In the end the EEG showed epileptogenic activity, my neurologist says due to the cyst, but I still have no answer about whether the EEG could have been affected by me moving because the doctors won't explain.\n\nI was prescribed valproic acid 250mg for epilepsy and escitalopram 10mg for organic anxiety disorder caused by the cyst. But I have my doubts because I have never had any kind of seizures, neither absences, and my anxiety is mostly caused because I get desperate when I procrastinate for not being motivated enough to do things, I get paralyzed, so I thought it was executive disfunction. The doctor also said he thought it could be autism but it wasn't likely.\n\nI am so tired of having these motivation lapses when I do a lot of stuff and then I struggle just to brush my teeth. So I was like, is it depression? is it anxiety? do I have ADHD? But I think bc of the cyst it might be a cocktail of symptoms...\n\nMy concern is that so far, although my daily life has been affected, I've been able to manage it, so this prescription seems a little too much, I'm not sure if I'm being misdiagnosed, and I'm afraid to take the meds. What has been your experience with any of these meds? My logic is that if I'm inattentive but anxious I can't have stimulants, but what if escitalopram, the antidepressant, makes me feel foggy and my focus gets worst? I still feel I need help someway and my psychologist won't treat me if unmedicated, but talking to her is what I feel I need most immediately.\n\nThanks for reading. 🤍",

In these 5 years I have had about 2 years or a year and a half of depression . Thank god I have been healing ever since but my problem is that in these 5 years I grown great self hatred towards me . And especially the fact I have been wasting those years . I genuinely don’t like myself anymore , as much as I don’t like my personality I also don’t like my physical features , just basically anything about me lol . I have been greatly insecure and I have been feeling for a while now that I am pathetic and a huge idiot especially because I kind of ruined 2 friendships with the kindest people ever because of my insecure personality and my overthinking . I don’t really think I am evil I just think that I am pathetic and freaking worthless . What I have done is that I would daydream my dream life and just wait for a miracle to happen to change my life . Allahmdulilah tho a miracle did happen that helped me heal from my depression. But now I want to live life , like actually live my life and stop wasting it . I have been searching for a while on the internet how to stop the self criticism but I can’t . It keeps telling me to talk kindly to my self , etc. I know I should do that but I can’t I stopped seeing the good in me although alot of people say I am kind I just think they don’t know the real me or that I am self hating myself . I want to get better , I want to live my dreams instead of daydreaming them . I get that the self hate is also destroying my life but I can’t help it I have been thinking like that for such a long time it’s hard to get rid of it . And I wanna be confident in myself , not be arrogant and not believe I am worthless next to others . What I also used to do is that I would feel confident when others would validate me like complimenting me , etc. and after the compliment by a while I would go back to my old self hating personality . I want my confidence to come from me and not others . I would greatly appreciate it if anyone gave advice on how to heal myslef without being arrogant or selfish and stop the daydreaming . Sorry for the long paragraph but thank you for reaching till the end 💗💗",

        "Text": "I feel so guilty about feeling so sad.\n\nLets start from the beginning. My dad died unexpectedly a few years ago and my mom faded away into drink and work so I had to take care of my little sister for a long time. Things seemed to be looking up when I entered university, I even found a boyfriend whom I am still with. Near my final year, I got really bad and my loneliness started to overwhelm me. When my dad died, all my friends left me and we had no more family friends left either. The 'friends' I met in university were so shallow and narcissistic. Their lives were so care-free, only thinking about partying and drinking. I didn't even know what depression was, just that my mom had it and everyone around me had it. My living situation with those 'friends' became very toxic, they blamed me for doing nothing around the house or making any effort to be friends even though I did everything. As I write this, I honestly can't even remember the rest of it. This 'forgetfulness' happened after my dad died too, I completely forgot all the feelings and events that happened after. I think it's my brain blocking it out because it was a lot to handle and remember. Not to mention that this wasn't the first time I lost friends. A few years ago when I had to pull out of a lease with friends because my family couldn't afford it since my mom had lost her job, those 'friends' tried to sue my family. Anyways, after I left that place in the middle of the night, my mom wouldn't listen to me about getting help. I had told her that summer that I think I'm not feeling well but she had brushed it off. I don't even remember, but something happened near my birthday that year. My mom got so angry at me and wouldn't talk to me from 2 weeks (including my birthday). I remember spending my birthday alone that year crying. That was when it got all too much and I tried to commit. My boyfriend drove me to the hospital and I waited there for a long time for the doctor to see me. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder. I got placed in a mental health group and got put on fluoxetine. Roughly around the beginning of that year, a war broke out in my home country as well.\n\nComing to today, I finished all my higher education and entered a politically-charged field. Looking at the state of the world makes me extremely sad. Finding a job where you make real impactful change, honestly ANY job, is near impossible since all the state wants is to protect the status quo. Compromise is the backbone of liberal democracy but how can you compromise between profit and people? In the name of protecting democracy, the West bombs other countries who don't accept capitalism as its main form of economy or purely for resources. While we all argue about social and identity politics, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I feel so guilty feeling so sad when so many people are in worse positions, dying of hunger and war around the world just because the West wants to expand for the sake of capitalism. Even getting therapy is for profit. It's scary that rich people can simply will themselves into power by attending exclusive events, receive better education and more opportunities for connections while they trample on unions, underpay and outsource labor. Nothing was ever merit based and I was so stupid to think that it was. This realization has made me so much more demoralized. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to help. Everything is too much. How is this life sustainable? ",

Tried going to university but I couldn’t continue.\nAnd now that I know that I have adhd… I question everything, my whole life.

This is my first post on here and I came here cause I don’t know what else to do.\n\nI have been struggling with these things for quite a while and usually always ignored them but I really wanna stop feeling this way and wanna know if this is related to any mental disorder.\n\nJust to make it clear If anyone decides to help me I will not be self-diagnosing based off of this. I just wanna start somewhere so I can maybe finally get the help I need.\n\nFirst of all this feeling started at least a few years ago and that is guilt - I am constantly guilty of absolutely everything I do. I feel guilty of being happy around my friends and family, I feel guilty of being sad around my friends and family. Mostly I am guilty whenever I do something wrong even if the person forgave me. It is constant, never-ending guilt of feeling emotions. It’s been really bad in the last week or so. My bestfriend has some issues with her bf and I always say she can vent to me whenever she wants but the problem is - I don’t know how to comfort and help her so I keep having really bad panic attacks because of not being helpful and I feel really guilty because of that. Even while writing this it is making me anxious because I’ve convinced myself everyone has bigger problems than me and I’m being a dramatic person. I cannot make this feeling stop. \n\nGuilt is my main problem. Other stuff I’ve been experiencing is - I do not feel real. I actually don’t feel like I am in my own body and apparently it’s related to derealization but I don’t know.  Next I have severe mood swings around my family ( and of course I feel guilty because of that) which results in constant fights and then I fall into some kind of depression and spend the whole day in my room ( which is basically everyday). I have a problem with suicidal thoughts and have almost attempted it once. But I cannot take my self seriously because I convinced myself it is only for attention even though it is not. I cannot talk to anyone about it , and I can’t talk to anyone about all of this and my feelings cause It. Makes. Me. Feel. Guilty.\nAnd I can’t figure out why.\n\nI am sorry for the extremly long post and sorry for any grammar mistakes since english isn’t my first language. I really hope I am not an only person with this problem (I’m sorry if anyone relates to this ofc) and I hope someone knows if this is related to any mental disorder.",

I have recently started to believe that I have ADHD - not a professional diagnosis - since I have had some issue with attention, obsession, memory, etc. from a considerably young age. But only now I have started to notice them and have started to take them seriously. I am listing down my observations and I want your opinions on this - again not a professional diagnosis but would really help:\n\n1. I find myself unable to switch my attention from one task to another and I tend to obsessively concentrate on the previous task while doing - actually trying hard and struggling - the current one. \n\n2. I have had serious memory issues with memory since my childhood days. I have a very bad memory and I think that the reason behind this is that I am not attentive enough. \n\n3. Sometimes I struggle to even process the most simplest sentences a person can speak. My friends joke about this too - not a problem I take them lightly - that I have a hearing issues but the truth is that I have struggle processing words. \n\n4. Since childhood one thing has been commin throughout my academic life which js that I knew all the answers but couldn't focus to right them down and also sometimes just sit for straight half an hour in a 3 hour exam despite knowing the answers. \n\n5. Often times I tend to obsessively focus on a task knowing that I have other urgent tasks to finish and knowing very well that I am wasting my time but failing to de-focus from the task I am doing - which is not at all urgent. \n\n6. I am a massive procrastinator.\n\n7. I have had anxiety issues and it led me to drop out of my dream master's program in philosophy and that too at my dream university. \n\n8. I rarely finish a project. I am a musician and have atleast 25 unfinished songs waiting to be finished for the last 4-5 years. \n\n9. I cannot multitask at all, my system immediately crashes. \n\n10. I have obsessed over so many things to the point that I practiced them 7-8 hours a day (music, cricket, story writing, poetry, learning languages) and never actually pursued it to its very end.\n\nThere are more but I guess I have already spammed you all with so many words. Your opinions would be really helpful. Thanks in advance🙌🏾🙌🏾",

My dad would beat me as a kid, not *too* much, there definitely is worse, but it was especially intense when I was 4, 5 and 6. And 7, I guess. He has anger issues, but I do love him, when he isn't angry he's a good dad mostly, but he turns into a monster when he is angry, and he gets angry pretty easily. It was really bad in those 3 years, he had lots of trouble at his work as he started working at a new company, and he's just a pretty angry person in normal, so he would come home and take it out of me by beating me up. There wasn't really a reason, he would come home and if he's angry, go around the house to find an excuse to hurt me and then always find one. He would tell me I was stupid and tell me he was going to leave to an orphanage, or give me for adoption, and then say no one would want me so he can't even give me out for adoption. He said I was useless. But when he wasn't angry, my mother and him would tell me that it was normal for fathers to discipline their children like that sometimes, and that they did it because they loved me. I grew up to believe it was completely normal and that everyone went through that, but I found out in high school that no, not everyone gets beaten up because they were chewing too loudly or started doing homework before tidying their toys. I went through a rough patch for three years but now I'm a lot better and I get along with my father, he's not as angry as he used to be when I was a kid, probably because he's now old. I'm 16 rn. I was gradually getting better but then suddenly, yesterday, I started feeling like I wanted to get beaten. I have no idea what kind of fucked up psychological phenomenon this is, but there is this tickling, itching feeling on my shoulders arms and back, and I want to get hit. What the fuck????? I want to get beaten up, I want to feel that sting, I want to feel the pain as his hand, a book, his slipper, his belt, whatever, hits my back. I want it so desperately and I have no idea what the fuck is happening? I read around a lot and asked my friend who loves researching, and we kind of came to the conclusion that it's a trauma response, but I'm not sure. I want to be hit so desperately it's making me feel nauseous. I want to get beaten up. If this is indeed a trauma response, please please PLEASE, what am I going to do about it? I tried sinking my nails in and scratching my back pretty badly, but it's not the same. I want to feel the stinging pain as I get striked. I want to be hit. What am I going to do please help I have no idea what to do I already had a panic attack so I took a shower and I feel a bit better but the itching urge to be hit isn't going away and I'm getting more agitated by the second. I might just go outside in the middle of the night and pick a fight with someone just to get beaten up but like I'm 16, that's not really an option either, I might hurt myself if this doesn't go away what am I going to do",

I have it somewhat controlled,  or maybe not. I don't know it's like this fear is not letting me be free. I know of many solutions but it's very hard to implement them. \nThe fact that this is a fear that is actually a truth and not just something I made up in my mind, I just can't completely discard it.

        "Text": "Hey everyone. So I was diagnosed with bpd about 2 years ago, and im 26y old. I also struggle with depression and some pretty bad social anxiety.  \n\nMy social anxiety makes it difficult for me to put myself out there, make new friends, and really hard to make connections with people. And I just feel so out of place and awkward talking to people sometimes. \n\nI unfortunately have a pretty long, messy history with jobs. I have not held a job longer than a year. I’m currently working from home as a CSR but taking back to back calls all day and dealing with angry/rude people makes me so miserable and it’s extremely difficult for me to not let it affect my mood and performance. \n\nI wanted to see if anyone else who also struggles with this has any advice/ideas on jobs that may be easier to stick with. \n\nI considered disability at one point but I know that process can be strenuous and I’m not sure if I could even provide the correct documentation to get approved for something like that.

So again I said, it's hot I'm using it (I was gonna go out of the room and it's more hot outside) and someone cut me off.\nThe one who cut me off was frowning, in an irritated voice, she looked angry and I got triggered. I don't like it if someone looks irritated or angry at me, I was being nice, refusing because I need it. My hand moved on it's own, I threw my pamaypay (not at her), I threw it infront of the girl that wanted to borrow it, she was seating behind my seat so it hit my desk. I threw it when I heard her irritated voice so I kinda cut her off, i didn't mean it though. After a few seconds I realized what I had done, I wanted to apologize for suddenly throwing my fan, but that girl who cut me off looks angry and irritated so I didn't, that girl that wanted to borrow it is her friend, she looked kinda shocked. \n\nA few months ago, a girl that I kinda hate (she's mean, always speaking in an angry irritated voice), wanted to ask me something, I was just seating quietly, I heard her irritated voice and I just got triggered. I don't remember what I said but I suddenly just said something mean to her. I only realize after a few seconds or minutes even, that what I did was wrong.\n\nThere are a lot more of this things, like me just suddenly not wanting to go to school if someone argues with me or says something mean to me the day before or before I go to school. It's like I'm just drained and all, and I just wanna hide, and avoid.\nEverytime these happen I get more guilty, I am hurting others with my actions.\nI have a negative view of myself, so when more of this happens It just adds up.\nI seriously don't know what I should do about this.",

Objectively things are good, I just had a really special life event, I have a good job, a loving husband, my family are healthy and well.\n\nBut my brain is on a rampage at the moment. I've been very affected by the stress leading up to the life event, and my brain just will not let me rest and feel joy. I am constantly ruminating on my mistakes, bad decisions I regret, things I would like to have changed, ways people have let me down in small ways. It's crippling and it's genuinely all I can think about, every waking moment and in my dreams. I cycle through different issues each day or few days. \n\nI keep a profile of being strong and confident with my friends and I don't feel comfortable being vulnerable with them especially when they all think my life has just been lovely of late (and it has! So I don't want to lead them to believe different).\n\nInstead I decided to take up therapy and have started with two different therapists to see which approach works better. Unfortunately despite a number of expensive months of this, I'm not making any progress. They both want to dive into the childhood aspects, but I don't feel like it's helping my very acute pain right now. \n\nSo I wanted to ask what people genuinely do to get some peace and joy in their lives and quiet a raging mind. I read, and journal, and watch movies and TV and sometimes play video games. I do work from home so I'm left with my own thoughts a lot which doesn't help.\n\nI'm just looking for some practical advice to complement my ongoing therapy so I can heal. Right now it feels like I'll be this way forever and the thought of that is torture.",

        "Text": "I repeat, CW for people with Etemophobia (fear of vomiting) \n\n\nHi guys, I developed etemophobia (fear of vomiting) around two years ago, but it became a lot stronger during the past year. For example, during my intro week to uni someone threw up during a lecture and I had a panic attack, which lead to me not being able to eat properly for around three days and took a long time to fully die down again. I have a hard time with the sound and smell, and obviously everything else like the taste, texture and overall feeling. Also can't eat yoghurts anymore for that reason, which really sucks 😅\n\nAnyways, my roommate is down with a stomach bug and apparently has been throwing up the entire day. I am surprised that I am still fairly relaxed about thus right now, but his room is downstairs which helps avoiding the sounds and just generally helps me feel like its not actually happening. It is though, and of course I'm worried I'll catch it. We share a kitchen (luckily not a bathroom), and I can't really avoid going there for the next three days because although my appetite has shrunken due to the announcement of his stomach bug, I still need to eat. \n\nDoes anyone who also have etemophobia has experience dealing with this? I don't want to hide away forever and I want yo continue my normal life, I'm also already trying to fight my etemophobia. It's really something I've been trying to work on for the past weeks because it's been limiting me in my day to day life, but to be honest this scares the shit out of me. After throwing up I generally cry (as many do too) but I'm scared that if I catch it I'll just be having constant panic attacks. And throwback to throwing up once it's over. Really not sure hoe to deal with it once I do actually throw up. \n\nAnd yes I have anti-nauseau/vomiting meds, but this isn't something I can avoid forever so I'd rather be able to deal with it in a way that doesn't lead to increased anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nThank you all in advance!",

Since struggling with anxiety I’ve just had such a negative mindset that I can’t seem to shake and I’ll be constantly thinking about how much I hate about myself like my body image (I HATE the way I look like I can’t even look in the mirror most times) and that’s only been worse since I’ve gained weight as food is a coping mechanism for me and it’s been difficult to break that habit. Another thing is how I feel so unbelievably unloveable and that I’ll never ever meet a woman who could possibly have feelings for me, and if they did then she must have something wrong about her, yet I’m so bitter of other people in relationships and want one so desperately.\n\nI think I want a relationship so badly so I can can actually have someone show me that all these things I think of myself are actually not true and how every rejection which I’ve had many only further confirms them and makes my self loathing go deeper to the point where I think about ending my life that giving up on everything is the easiest choice I could make. And when you’re that deep in the negativity you don’t really think or care about how taking your own life affects others around you you only think about how it makes sense to do since no one cares about you anyway.\n\nBut also deep down I don’t want to kill my self I just want to feel seen and wanted and desired by someone romantically because I’ve been so alone in this battle and my whole teenage life really, I haven’t had a single relationship ever and ever felt wanted or needed by a woman which is something I want to feel.\n\nI guess I’m just feeling miserable at the moment but aren’t we all.",

I suffer from anxiety, and sometimes people who know this try to cheer me up but end up saying things that unintentionally trigger my anxiety. So, I think it’s better to say nothing than to risk making the situation worse.\nSince that day, every time she says things like, “Oh, yesterday I ate too much, but I threw it all up,” it catches me off guard, and I don’t know how to respond. I feel like she doesn’t realize the seriousness of the situation.\nI’d like to help her, but I don’t know how, especially since I’m not very close to her, and I don’t know if she’d appreciate me getting involved.

It happens when I’m coming out of sleep, usually after dozing off for a few minutes or so, it doesn’t happen when waking up from a full night’s sleep. I feel extremely warm and like my head is swimming. I feel like I can’t move. (Not exactly paralyzed but that I don’t want to move.)

I want to find a job and start pulling my own weight, taking the pressure off my caretakers to care for this grown adult who refuses to act any more mature than a child. Not even counting the actual dreams I had for my life, or whether or not I’ll be able to experience relationships or sex. As it stands, I can’t juggle basic tasks like eating healthy, getting my daily steps, caring for my dental hygiene, and doing laundry. \n\nMy depression isn’t existential, it’s based in my reality. I don’t want to be in pain for the rest of my life. I don’t want others to be cleaning up the messes I make of my own life forever. I know I put myself here with my own self-negligence, but I don’t know how to claw myself out. It’s so hard. It’s so hard. ",

(You have gone so far, and I'm so proud to whoever is reading this. You deserve the world.)\n\nThis first one may sound cringy and might not work for you but, when I feel like I can't do something or when I'm not good enough I say something in my head like. \"It's ok 'my name' it will get better!\" Than proceed to think of the funniest/dumbest thing I can think of! Like \"Top ten weirdest anime audios.\"  That get's me laughing :D\n\nSecond, make little scenarios in my head about anything. I mainly like day dreaming about funny cats or my favorite ships but anything works! ≽\\^• ˕ • ྀི≼\n\nThird, play some of your favorite games!\n\nIf you're into sims, download some cc/mods! Make your favorite show characters into sims! Put your sims in some scary situation! Try to make a really good emo character! (I'm saying this because I can't, I've tried but failed lol.  ˙◠˙ )\n\nIf you like Roblox, play horror games! Maybe you're to scared to play horror games? Play vc games! No vc? Play a fashion game!! Not good with fashion/being creative (You are creative but maybe not in that way!) ?? Play fighting games!! Maybe you're not that great at fighting?? That's ok! There are endless amounts of games for you to play! When I'm sad I love to play zombie games, fighting games, blair/specter 2 (horror games), mic up. And so much more!\n\nMaybe you like Minecraft?? Download mods! Can't do mods? Try hardcore! Set a list for things you want to complete in Minecraft! When I play I always like doing these: Get a book and quill, find a base near a village, (and the rest of my list depends on my spawn ദ്ദി(｡•̀ ,<)\\~✩‧₊ )\n\nForth, watch funny animal videos! When I'm down I like watching videos of horses from really silly angles! I also love cat videos! (Dw I love dogs I'm js more of a cat person ♡⸜(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⸝♡ )\n\n5th(how do you type that number(╥﹏╥) ) , Play with your pets!! I have cats and they always want either a cuddle or some play time!!\n\nSixth, this one is just going to be a mix of random things I do because this is getting long TᴖT.. Clean your room! Go get some water/drink some water:3! Go eat!!! Take a shower and do some skincare(If you have any skincare (๑>؂•̀๑) ) Watch HAPPY movies/shows!! Make a note pad of things you want to clean up and do that one by one! Like when you clean your room do something like this: 1: pick up plates. 2: Put clothing in a pile. 3: take out trash. 4: make bed. etc!! You can do it! (Sorry if this doesn't help you =͟͟͞͞(꒪ᗜ꒪‧̣̥̇) )\n\n(One more thing! If you can't play any games, go outside!! Be a kid again! Play hopscotch (Idk how to spell that)!! Ride bikes! Walk around! And also if you're to scared to play horror games, listen to some really fun music/loud music and sing super loud while playing the game!! I like listening to Ado during Blair/specter2 on Roblox (˶◜ᵕ◝˶) )",

I tried getting away from phone to avoid texting him because when he replies late or give uninterested replies, i get hurt amd fruestrated. I dont even know if being friends with the person u have romantic feeling is good idea? Becausse its making me aggressive. I many times tried to cut ties and all but even if he sends one small msg i feel he cares for me and later i keep sending txt to whicj he doesnt reply or reply late i get more hurt. \nWhen he met my sister i kind of felt that he likes her more and he praised her. It still hurts me. I cry more thesedays. I feel he doesnt like me or get embarrassed if someone get to know that i am his friend.\nIs becoming a cycle and i want to get away from it. I want to not get impacted by his behaviour even if he replies late. I cant even cut off him froom my life. Its so traumatic sometimes that i cant control myself from texting him as if i would loose him if i dont text.\nPlease give genuine advices on whaatt to do",

For context: we are Canadians who have been living and working in the US since 2016. As you can imagine, we are at the mercy of other people’s decisions. He was generally an optimistic, caring person. I have always been more cynical and have, for my own mental health, been concentrating on things at a micro level as opposed to a macro level and limited my consumption of the macro issues I can’t change (ie election results).\n \nThe outcome of this election has shattered his world view. He isn’t seeing the good in the world anymore and believes this is truly the beginning of the end for democracy and all philosophies he holds dear. He is angry and has retreated. His (treated) ADHD is going haywire to the point he can’t concentrate on anything except games and going down internet rabbit holes. As you can imagine, I am VERY worried about him.\n \nThings I have tried:\nEncouraging additional sessions with his therapist so he can discuss (he has agreed to this)\nKeeping our day-to-day as consistent as possible\nTaking things off his plate if I can\nEncouraging him to reach out to his friends (although they are in similar positions)…\nEncouraging him to get out and see the outdoors (he is WFH and it’s already a struggle to get him to do that)\nAsking him to avoid media for now\nEmphasizing my support and offering it whenever I can\n \nOf note:\nHe is mostly extremely angry. He knows I have a significant amount of trauma around anger and voice raising so is unwilling to truly vent to me, even if I let him know I’m fine with it.\n \nSo, Reddit. I ask. How can I help him? I really love him and want to help him through this but an existential crisis is beyond my capabilities.\n \nThank you in advance!",

But I also experienced different kinds, like people having an indistinct conversation. I also sometimes would have light related and shadow hallucinations but many people have told me that these could be related to the eye.\n\nThe most distinct hallucination I have had was when I was walking around my house and suddenly saw embers floating in the air. Like embers from a fire. It was very beautiful and realistic and I was able to walk through it and touch them. \n\nAnyways, my question is: can anyone give me advice on what the cause of this may be? I'm not too knowledgeable about schizophrenia but I doubt I have that since I don't experience other symptoms. I really want to understand why, I have been to therapists but they doubted the reliability of my claims. My sister was diagnosed with a psychotic break and experienced delusions. Not sure if this stuff runs in my family other than that, but mental illness in general is prevalent.",

        "Text": "For a little context I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1, bpd, and ocd, I have struggled with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember and self harming tendencies since I was 11. I’ve been hospitalized four separate times, three for suicide and one for a psychotic episode, I’ve seen countless therapists both cbt and dbt, I’ve tried every medication under the sun, I work out, go to work, eat regular meals, drink a ton of water, take vitamins, and keep the house clean, in other words I’m putting in the work and I’m trying to better my mental health. The problem is I still feel terrible, I’m constantly suicidal (even when I’m happy the thought just changes from “I wish I were dead” to “if I die rn I’ll die happy”). \nIn the past I stayed alive for my loved ones because I didn’t want them to be sad, I tried finding my own reason for living but never really grasped onto anything. Now recently I came to the conclusion that although my loved ones would be absolutely devastated if I died, ultimately, they would be able to go on. Everyone I love is incredibly resilient and although my death would be a devastating blow I was sure that they would be able to pick up the pieces of their life and it would stop hurting. \nEverything listed in the above paragraph I essentially told to one of my best friends the other day and he was very adamant that he wouldn’t be able to move on with his life after my death and even said that I’m really the only reason he’s excited about his future and he doesn’t see any future for himself if I’m not around. I love him so much and would never want to do something that would hurt him but I don’t want to keep living like this especially when it feels like there’s nothing left for me to try to get better. Going back to the mental hospital is not an option, I love him to death and he’s really the only thing stopping me at this point, I feel so awful for even thinking or feeling this way but I can’t help it and I don’t know what else to do to fix my brain. I’ve been told that it doesn’t get better, I just get stronger and have more tools in my toolbox but how much stronger do I need to get to overcome this? How many more tools do I need to acquire? I want to get better but I just can’t seem to be able to, does anybody have any tips or… anything? I’m all out of constructive ideas and he’s a good enough reason to stay so I want to actually keep trying, I just don’t know what else to try, ",

She probably doesn't, but at one point she did. I think I'm being really clingy for no apparent reason, and I feel really bad for it. I don't want her to hate me.",

Sometimes, I feel these strong impulses, like I’m about to do something or I already did something—whether it’s in the past or the future. When these OCD thoughts kick in, my mind gets so caught up analyzing them—trying to figure out where they came from or if they’re real—that I lose track of what I’m actually doing in the moment.\n\nFor example, I might not remember where I put my car keys or what I just did because I was so distracted by these thoughts. It freaks me out because it makes me question myself. Did I do something wrong? Am I about to do something impulsive? Deep down, I know I didn’t, but the fear is still there.\n\nIt makes me feel like I’m losing control, almost like I have something more, like bipolar disorder, even though I know it’s just my OCD messing with me. Does anyone else deal with this? Feeling like your thoughts or impulses are running the show and you’re just stuck in fear or denial?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how others cope with this.

        "Text": "Hey guys, first off I want to start out with that I know this is not some diagnosis subforum and am not looking for that. I am simply looking for reassurance and advice. (I am 16 btw)\n\nAnyways so back in January of this year. I took some Delta-8 THC edibles with some friends of mine. I took a lot and I mean probably around 250mg if I can remember. (This was the first time I tried cannabis) After I took them I slept for a whole two days feeling extremely groggy and everything was spinning. Weeks after that I felt tired and had an altered perception where things sometimes seem farther away and sometimes blurry. Everything also felt like a dream and didn't feel real. I was not worried at the time however because I thought everything would just go away. Fast forward to now (November):\n\nI have told my parents a few months after the incident where I was getting increasingly worried and my symptoms were getting worse. My symptoms included extreme fatigue. The altered perception part of the whole situation is extremely hard to verbally explain but it just feels like everything is blurry and you are in a dream that you can't escape. Trouble thinking was also a new symptom that arose. I went to a therapist a lot first where to be honest therapy didn't really help for me but I got some insight on anxiety and how all this could be horrible anxiety. I went to a psychiatrist in October and they at least ruled out Psychosis and all that scary stuff. The psychiatrist also didn't really know what to say so they referred me to go to a neurologist. This month I went to a neurologist and they didn't find anything wrong and ordered and MRI. I am scheduled to get an MRI in 2 weeks. Also, my blood pressure is recently high as I found out at the neurologist. I have been monitoring blood pressure at home now and it is consistently high like 128-130/65 nonstop. I still am experiencing these symptoms as I have stated above but they have not gotten worse but have not really gotten better maybe a slight tad amount. A new symptom that arose within the last 2 weeks too is trouble sleeping. I can't fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nAnyways why I am here on this forum is to try and get some advice from people who may have dealt with similar things and also to get advice if at this point I should maybe take medication at this point. My therapist, psychiatrist, and neurologist have all said in my situation it is best to begin medication. My parents are fairly against medication but my dad is most. My dad would really not want me to take medication but I don't have that good of a relationship with him anyways. I am skeptical with medication use as well.\n\nSo what do I think this is? I think in all 11 months, this is mostly just anxiety, really bad anxiety. Also I'm not even anxious about the weed anymore. I get anxiety from everything and its bad. I worry about literally everything to the nearest extreme now.",

The only piece of esteem I hold is a comment someone made at my mother's funeral, remarking how much I look like my mom, and feeling disgusted as I spoil her image.\n\nI discovered a long time ago that my integrity is more important than the opinions and time of people who don't value me as an individual. I'm never going to have the connections I had in the past when I was being my raw self, and I have to move on.   \nGod has a frustratingly iron grip over my fate, and He's denied me the basic things he gives to most other people, in an effort presumably to lead me back to Him. God has been silent my whole life and I wish he would just let me go. I feel like I'm going to go to hell anyways, and I wish he would just let me have someone that loves me for the short time I'm on earth.",

        "Text": "I genuinely am not sure if this is me overreacting or if i am seeing the situation correcting. I started seeing a psychiatrist for medication after a psychologist told me she thinks i have bipolar 2 and OCD, the psychiatrist immediately shut that down first session and said i just have depression, an anxiety disorder and \"bpd traits\". I wanted anti anxiety meds for the panic attacks i get several times a week, which make it extremely difficult to function especially in college, and she instantly said no. I found her reaction odd and off-putting, I understand those medications are addictive but it would be reasonable to consider. I left with an anti depressant and i was honestly pretty disappointment because i was hoping that this will be the turning point in my panic attack issue which has been plaguing my life for so long. I decided to just wait and see if the Prozac will be effective, it just made me feel numb. The next session was worse, when i arrived it was above our appointment time and she was outside her office talking to a colleague. Since the door was open and we made eye contact, i just entered her office and sat down. She came in and started yelling at me for entering without permission and kept mentioning the documents she had in there. I thought her explanation was understandable but the reaction put me off so much. She berated me like i was some child who entered the room to mess around, not an adult who came here for an appointment. After some time she sat down to start the session and instantly changed her tone to that monotone creepy ass voice she uses. I'm not sure if she thinks its comforting to patients but it just makes me feel like I'm about to get murdered in the next hour. It feels like she's not working with me in any way, she uses what i say and twists it to fit her already set in mind narrative.\n\n It feels like there's this tension and distaste towards me hidden beneath the veneer of institutional protocol. I started the semester a while back and skipped a lot of classes due to depressive episodes, violent issues at home and a suicide attempt. She knew all this but when i asked for an excused absence paper, she said she couldn't attest to me missing the classes over September as the last time i saw her was over the summer and that i should have made an appointment sooner. I think this is completely ridiculous, i just can't wrap my mind around it. She agreed with me that my mental health and family excuses were valid, but said she would not write the paper because she just can't attest to the validity of my claims for the month of September ? Is this just normal protocol in this field ? The worst part is she acknowledges that by this point its too late to catch up and that it will ruin my grade average, and she knows that I've applied to a university in new York city which is my chance to leave my abusive household, but that application could be ruined by these grades. She knows this and yet she just shrugged. I feel like i have been transparent and cooperative but it feels like she's treated me like a mentally ill clown who cannot be talked but must be talked down to, yet at the same time i am not \"mentally ill enough\" for medications i want try and basic documents that should not be this much of an issue to get. Am i just overreacting and this is just how all of psychiatrists are ?\n\n",

I spend a lot of time “co-existing” with my partner when we are doing independent activities, but I struggle doing these activities when I’m alone in the house and I can’t explain why. \nI was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago during an unrelated psychiatric appointment, I have been treating it with medication which helps most of the symptoms aside from my rejection sensitivity. \nI don’t feel like my friends reach out to me as much as I reach out to them, I feel like I’m always the one making plans. I feel like I’m the only person who ever makes decisions which can be exhausting when trying to plan outings, I’d REALLY like to just have someone make plans and say yes for once. \n\nI feel like I have so much more that plays into this so I’m open to answering clarifying questions.

I've grown up in a toxic household (nothing like physical abuse, but a lot of yelling and have witnessed my fair share of bad fights), and I am of age and can move out but can't support that financially at the moment (I will hopefully when I graduate). There is yelling every day between my other family members, and someone in my house is narcissistic and every interaction has to be about them. I'm sick of the yelling, I feel like I can't take it anymore.\n\nI try to stay out of it all, and have done my best too, but after years and years of this going on I feel like i'm more short tempered and angry. I am always tired all the time. I don't have energy to maintain relationships and I feel like i'm self sabatoging when I don't want to be. I'm sick of all the yelling. I used to be able to disconnect from it all but now I feel like I can't and that there is something wrong with me. Can constant yelling in a house cause this, or is it something different? I know this is kind of vague, but i feel defeated and tired and don't know what to do. I had a fight with someone I cared about and they asked me why I was treating them badly and I said I don't know, I really don't know why I am being like this. I don't want to be this angry.\n\nSorry this is vague, any advice would help. And just if constant yelling can cause people to feel like this? I really can't explain why I feel like this. Thank you for anyone who responds and I'm sorry if this is too confusingly written.",

The issue was not at personal level but for the small contribution of the whole family - so everyone had added misery to the life of other (my opinion). Though we're \"family\" but never met my expectations. In the discussion, I spoke my heart out while crying in front of my whole family. Don't know how much they'd listened and how they'll react now.\n\nComing today, I can't face them, I'm feeling they'll think I'm weak. I'm avoiding conversations. Coz back of my mind I think they won't take actions for anything & just ignore things, but things will continue, and they'll have perception - I'm weak !\n\nJust to add, I'm also not able to meet their expectations - I'm feeling, I avoid their work - thinking this work is mean/small to me, but do not take up. I don't what has happened to me for past half year or so.\n\nViews on how I should take up things now?  Shall I be silent for few days or shall I make a small trip nearby for 2 days for them to think of things? How someone from similar background came back - would be inspiring to know.",

Fear of penetration to the point of not using Tampons.\n\n\\-Anxious attachment style, constantly needing affirmation, regressing to a child-like demeanor around people that I trust; rejection-sensitive to the point of attempted suicide over it. Low self esteem, overtly careful around authority figures.\n\n\\-I've always been interested in sadomasochism since i was about 11-12, when I was exposed to CNC kink and BDSM content + had some interactions on the internet (which is admittedly not very good, to say the least, but not what I consider to be traumatizing.) I spent subsequent years fantasies with varying levels of consent, and simultaniously vivid, distressing, dreams about being assaulted in a manner very different from what I've seen- always a female/afab victim whose perspective I see out of, always a male, overweight perpetrator, and always completely non-arousing. Also occasioal intrusive thoughts about assault. The only traumatizing thing close to \"sexual abuse\" is being spanked in the buttocks as punishment by my parents and grandparents + online rp chatting with older folks.\n\n\\-Memory issues, possibly stemming from ADHD. I primarily remember my childhood in small collections of events- i.e \"getting detention somewhere in 4-6th grade,\" etc. I don't think I started remembering until I was 5-6. If I try hard I can remember the locations at school and vague faces of some of my elementary and middle school teachers, but not very well. \n\n\\-Bodily dysmorphia, possibly dysphoria. Extreme aversion to being perceived sexually. Also TMI but \"sad nipple syndrome\" happening?\n\n\\-Tendency for dissasociating; I've talked to multiple people who have some form of dissasociative disorder and what they said felt really, really familiar to me for some reason, even though I don't think I have anything like outright DID. \n\nAll this would typically point towards something sinister happening to me in my childhood in a degree far higher than in actuality. I've got a strained but fine relationship with my parents, though my father tends to deny all forms of using physical punishment on me (even though I clearly remember him whipping my buttocks with his belt.) I feel as if, to put it bluntly, that the issues that I'm having are far more severe than what \\*should\\* be and that there's something going on that's unaddressed.",

We found her already cold body in her bedroom. She suffered an asthma attack, and no one was there to help her. We knew she still wanted to live as she tried one last time to call her neighbor. The neighbor picked up but they couldn't hear anything from the other end because she couldn't talk anymore, so they thought she probably called them by accident. Our friend wasn't home because she went to school and she blames herself for it...\n\nThe other was our beloved family dog, who was only 4 years old. She was one of my family's greatest sources of joy. My family and I witnessed how the vet kept trying to revive her, but she passed away that night on the vet's table. I miss her so so much, and she left a big hole in our hearts.\n\nI've always known that death comes for us all, but these two deaths made me feel how REAL that is. And so, I fear and pray for my loved ones every day. I see my mother growing liver spots around her face, and my I can see more and more gray hairs on my father. Every time I see these details, I feel a sense of dread. It's scary. I'm their only child, so I have no siblings to be with me when the time comes. I randomly get this queezy gut feeling, and the first thing I do is pray for my parents. I'm living in fear every day, and it hurts.",

Would I tell her not to and call the police? And what would I do if a guy friend was doing that to a girl, would it be different? I'm really scared. I don't know what I should do in those situations. Obviously this won't happen irl, but I'm afraid because Id on't want to do the wrong thing. Also my ocd is saying that if i'd react differently in one gendered scenario compared to the other, it's due to being a feminist and thinking men vs women are different in regards to SA risk and stuff, so I should stop being a feminist and cut off my friends who are. Obviously that is also a logical jump, but idk what to do. ",

I don’t mean this sexually I am more talking about that dream that someone actually does care about me and even if they intentions are not good or I know they are not good for me I will still try to be there for them no matter what since I just want someone to say or who that they appreciate that I exists since I never have that in my life.

Every depressive episode that lasted like a week or so had it's happy phase when I didn't care about a single thing in life. Careless. Happy. But in between those thoughts there were malicious thoughts of brutal ways I could die/km$. The happy phase usually lasts a few months and then I just burst out in tears, helpless, hopeless, confused. It's getting worse. I feel so lonely although I have the most amazing people around me. My favourite person recently has started to ignore my messages. I know she loves me, I do. She came to my house on her bike 5 km just to console me when I was crying my butt out. It was the day we started dating. God I miss her. I miss her voice. I miss her face, her laugh. I'm so helpless. Recently, I started cutting. It was a hell of a journey too. In my house I have no privacy but I'm okay with it because I'm comfortable with my parents. I could walk around unbothered in my underwear and no one would comment a thing. My dad's an alcoholic. He never hit though. Only yelled. As far as his lungs could go. I just wish he would realize I knew he was harming himself more than he was harming me and my mother. I love him and I want only the best for him. I hate alcohol. Back to the privacy thing. I want to cut all over my body, but my parents will see and I don't want them to worry. I hate seeing them cry. We have a lot of fights because of school. especially with my mom. But it's okay, I know she loves me. My dad loves me more. I just wish he could realize what he's doing to me. And himself. I don't feel alive. I want to feel alive. I want to feel something, anything even if it is insufferable pain. All I feel is numbness. Since I was a little child. I'm not much older thought only a few years older. It's enough to drive you insane though, if you would've been stuck in the woods alone for even 5 days you would've gone mad and be \"a part\" of the woods. In my situation, I don't want to be a part of the woods. I want to feel normal. Be normal. I'm carrying everyone's problems like it's nothing and then cry them out after a few months. The sad phase. And after that I tell myself that I'm so embarrassing and I'm so overly sensitive and a wimp. I want to be loved properly, and be able to love properly.\nSometimes I wonder how I can be so ugly on the inside. Imperfect. Scarred. I need therapy. I don't want therapy. It'll make me tell the therapist everything and you know where I'll end up? Dead in the psych ward hanging by the ceiling with the damn hospital gown string. I do horrible things. I hurt people. I'm selfish. At this point I don't even care how I look because if I'm ugly on the inside there's no way I can be beautiful on the outside. It's awful. I feel bad for my parents. My mom once told me that my grandma cursed me with laziness and that she prayed it wouldn't be true. It because true. I feel like I'm not who she wants me to be. I'm a disappointment. Useless. I don't help around the house I don't do chores. I'm only good at laying in bed and doing homework all day. Don't even get me started on school. Sure I have great friends there, but beside those friends are the stupid immature boys that when they see a period stain they make fun of you 2 years straight..luckily that hasn't happened to me because I count my days before my period.

I have been repeatedly on and off dating and looking for a long term relationship but things never turn into that. I think I do a pretty good job of sussing out people who are looking for the same and that I connect with on deeper values, but it still always fails and the other person slides into giving the bare minimum till it ends at some point. It has been 8 years since I’ve been in a serious relationship. And I’ve always been looking or open. I am 26F, am what most would consider pretty attractive, am fit, but I am not a model by any means. I have a good job/work life but I am working hard to move up to better things. I am deeply depressed. I have “friends”, mostly acquaintances, but only one I actually talk to about deeper issues - but she takes up most of the space and at the moment is in happy go lucky honeymoon stage with the perfect man for her. She seriously sucks at choosing healthy partners and they are often abusive but magically one decided to land on her plate. Trust me that if I did talk to her right now, I would feel worse afterwards. \n\nI don’t have a history of trauma, but I have a deep and chronic loneliness wound that sometimes resurfaces. I have consistent chronic fatigue regardless of the amount of sleep or exercise or healthy diet I have been getting, as well as ‘brain fog’ that rarely goes away.

So I try to only scroll on an app like TikTok till I hit a video that is **negative**. then I scroll until I find a *really* nice **positive** video, close the app and end that screen time session on a good note.\n* When listening to music I always try to keep it **positive**. \n* Yes, I know it can be beneficial for those with depression etc. to listen to sad songs but it isn't for me. \n* I organize my playlists on whatever streaming service I use and try to keep the **negative** songs in one place. \n* I literally created a playlist called \"sad\" that I only play when I'm really unwell. \n* I added a handful of my favorite songs to that playlist and hit shuffle. \n* I do this because I accidentally and without knowing added 1 absurd song to the sad playlist a while ago and shuffle did its thing and completely pulled me out of that headspace I was in and kinda saved my life.\n* *Always* listen to more new music. Never ever forget its one of the best parts of life.\n\n# Lists/Planning\n\n* Personally I use Google Tasks and have the app closest to my thumb on my phone.\n* As you already know we want to avoid screen time so if anything pops into my head at bedtime that needs to be entered into tasks then I write that down on paper and digitize it the next day.\n* Marking tasks as done feels good! The structure really made life better.\n\nThese small changes bring some type of routine and control ?\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\n",

We lived on a lot of land far away from some infrastructure like internet, so we used an AT&T hotspot. Worked well when not under too much pressure from multiple devices.\n\nMy Aunt wanted to watch Netflix while she was staying with us. I needed the hotspot since I was homeschooling after my femur, jaw, and teeth broke from getting hit by a car while riding my Kawasaki. My aunt and I fought over the hotspot while my Mom was starting to cry from the argument. I don't remember how the argument went down exactly, just the end of it. I told my aunt (not verbatim), \">!I want to stick a deagle in my mouth cause you won't shut up!!<\". *I did not feel suicidal and I did not own a gun and I was not a danger to myself. I needed to emphasize how frustrating it was that I could not do my homework as I felt that it was selfish she wanted the bandwidth for Netflix when I needed it for a legitimate purpose.*\n\nNeed to interject here for context, just months before this my dad had >!done something very similar to what I quoted.!<\n\nMy aunt went to my Mom and told her that I just told her I was about to >!kill myself just like my dad did!<. She laid such a bombshell of a situation for me and my Mom that I didn't bother explaining and just headed to my room. My aunt wasn't listening before and she was not going to listen to rebuttal now.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I got a knock from my friend's step-dad at my door downstairs. His step-dad was very good friends with my dad and I assumed my Mom probably called him instead of the police. He did his best to reassure me through it all but emphasized to my Mom not to call the police as they might make the situation worse.\n\nWell the police showed up anyway and nobody was sure who called them. My aunt was telling them I said I was going to >!kill myself!< according to them. They asked, \"did you say you we're gonna >!stick a deagle in your mouth!<?\" I was way too emotional at the time and couldn't think very straight anymore since I was basically sobbing for the last hour. Everything was escalating way too far and I was starting to feel responsible. I wanted to be as agreeable as possible to these people and just said yes hoping this could all end. I fully admit this is the moment I should have spoken up but I did not. The step-dad tried to help saying that's not what I said but the 2 officers weren't having it.\n\nSo with enough evidence against me the police escorted me to the ER where I spent the night under the cameras until morning. I got transported to a hospital North-West of the ER and spent three days there in total. Got put on pills and a 15 minute rotation at night for suicide watch.\n\nThe valuable thing I learned there was from my therapist. We all had a group therapist there and we did an exercise in a circle where everyone was deciding who they were going to throw overboard on a hypothetical ship. Can't remember the reason why but I got the majority vote and didn't offer any argument as to why I shouldn't even though everyone else gave a reason why they shouldn't be tossed off the ship. The group therapist said I was like a punching bag and wasn't giving any valuable reason as to why I should not be thrown over or someone else should and just kept taking punches. Some punches not being legitimate.\n\nWent home to an aunt-less house so that's cool too.",

I fell into a pit of many unhealthy habits, all of which were all ready growing problems that weren't addressed before I ever left treatment, but when I made the decision to leave, those problems were at their worst. It stayed that way for nine months until I finally was able to commit to changes. I never went back on the meds or any treatment, I started working out intensively, fasting, changed how I ate, and actively tried to fix every mess I made for myself. After 5 months, I dropped 100 lbs, I am in the best shape I've ever been in my life, and my mindset has completely changed. I went from chronic harmful thoughts and ideation, to having none at all. \n\nI can at least accept where I am now even if I am not content, but the problem is, despite all that I've improved on, I have nothing else to show for it. I take care of my responsibilities and i've tried connecting and reconnecting with people but it never works out for reasons I don't really comprehend because my social skills were never great to begin with, and after dealing with complete social isolation and withdrawal since leaving therapy, that's magnified by a lot, and as a result I've started building up resentment from that too. I don't really like it, but it's there.. (I tried getting in to a specialist for this, but where I'm from that kind of help is near nonexistent and I was never able to be seen by the one person I was recommended.) Which goes back to the title.. Why should I continue the effort if the universe and the people in it treat me the same as if not worse than before I changed? ",

Witnessed abuse at his mom's house from her now former-partner, was terrorized himself there, was severely oppositional in school and went through multiple alternative schools, some of which had their own traumatic effect, before dropping out of the last terrible one and began pursuing a ged program. Behaviors have always been worse at school and almost non-existent at home, but now that's starting to change. Mom's not in the picture, as he chose to go no contact with her (for pretty legit reasons -- she abandoned him twice and over the years emotionally abandoned him; she jas her own issues with depression and explosive rage, on top of being abused in 2 different relationships and being my abuser at one point). Things have slowly been getting worse, yet he thinks it's getting better. My therapist and his independently suggest borderline. It does fit. (I'm not a professional, but I am a student headed toward being a therapist myself.) He has an initial appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow and I very much expect a borderline diagnosis on top of the adhd and ptsd. He was always an extremely compassionate, sensitive, thoughtful, caring kid. Really genuinely, not performatively. He has a very strong sense of justice and protecting the people he cares for.\n\n\nI'm scared. I've been breaking down and having panic attacks over the diagnosis because I've read so many horrifying cases, and many therapists outright say they would never take on a borderline client. All I have ever wanted was for my child to be okay. Every decision I've made has been with that aim in mind. I guess I'm just reaching out for support or advice. I'm fucking terrified at what this means.",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "Hi Reddit, new account for obvious reasons. I’m here looking for advice on a situation in my relationship. I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (23F) for a year now, and I love her deeply. She’s a wonderful person, and I care about her a lot. But lately, I’ve been feeling emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed, and I’m struggling to cope with everything that’s been going on.\n\nMy girlfriend has been battling anorexia and depression for most of our relationship. She’s had periods where she was actively seeking help, even seeing a psychiatrist for a while. For a bit, things seemed to improve, and she was doing better. But recently, her mental health has taken a downturn again, and she’s struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n\nAlthough she usually goes to the doctor when things get really bad, I often have to push her to make appointments. She’s mentioned that she doesn’t feel that the psychiatrists she’s seen have been helpful and says they aren’t good enough. Despite this, she’s also not open to paying for private therapy because of money. I tried to help her pay, but she doesn't want any help regarding money, which leaves her without consistent support.\n\nThis situation is really wearing me down. I try to be there for her and support her in every way I can, but it’s taking a toll on me mentally and emotionally. I haven’t had an honest conversation with her about how this is affecting me, partly because I worry about making her feel like a burden or adding to her struggles. I also struggle with assertiveness in relationships, and in the past, I’ve just waited for things to improve, especially because I’ve never been the one to end a relationship.\n\nThere are times when I consider leaving, but then she’ll have a “good phase,” and I start to think things will be okay. Unfortunately, those good phases never seem to last, and I end up feeling this same emotional exhaustion again and again.\n\nMy question is: how do I bring up how I’m feeling without making her feel guilty or like she’s to blame? I want to be honest with her about my needs, but I don’t know how to approach it gently. I also worry about what to do if things don’t improve. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?\n\nThank you for any advice or insight. I really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR:** My girlfriend (23F) of one year struggles with anorexia, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I (23M) try to support her, but it’s taking a toll on my mental health. She won’t seek private therapy and finds current psychiatric options unhelpful. I’m feeling exhausted but don’t know how to talk to her about it without making her feel like a burden. Looking for advice on how to have this conversation and how to handle the situation.",

I rarely have time to do the things I enjoy cause i‘m so tired when I get home after work.\nObviously this is something everybody goes through but I just feel so lost and lonley right now. Im literally scared of everything i feel like I was always dependent on someone while growing up. I feel like I cant do anything by myself. \n \nIt just feels hopeless because I know things will only get worse from here on. I still hate talking on the phone or meeting new people. I‘m honestly scared of driving alone, because other people might think i‘m stupid because I made mistakes. Why are these things so easy for everybody else but not for me?          \nI always pretend that I am someone else. That I‘m confident in public Situations. But in reality I overthink every little thing I do and its exhausting. Why am I like this? \n\nI can‘t write about everything cause my mind is just full with so many different thoughts and feelings but this is just what I was mainly feeling right now. ",

        "Text": "I have been thinking about religion for months now and it's driving me insane, I really don't want to be real because hell sounds so awful and no one deserves that. It's probably all bullshit but I keep thinking about if the bible authors had a good reason to write what they wrote or I hear about testimonies today and I don't know how to feel. Is it more silly to believe without evidence or is it more silly to think everyone's lying or has this secret agenda? I hate that I'm a naive person and I trust too easily. Something within me says it's bs and that I'm going to waste my life but I also have a hard time believing everyone's lying. I'm also trying to recover from depression but this keeps nagging at me, I see how religion harms others and I know that it will harm me too. Any thoughts?",

        "Text": "So I had a girlfriend not too long ago (ill call her C) and I was really in love with her, we'd been friends for a year prior to us dating and with a few hiccups (notably me being a complete narcissistic asshole to her and everyone around me so much so I lost alot of my friends) we had a pretty good friendship. Before I started dating C i was dating another girl (Ill call her A). Now me and A broke up in a pretty bad manner and that kinda hurt me for a while. Anyway in April/May i found out that C became friends with A which then eventually made C cut me out off her life (which crushed me because i was quiet LITERALLY in love with her) but after a while we became friends again in June.\n\nAfter a while i found out C liked me back and i was really happy and we started “dating” (teenage dating so basically just calling, seening eachother every once and a while at my house because her mother LOATHES me, and at school.) Which then eventually forced me to become friends with A again. So now i had this 5 friend circle between A, C and 2 other people ill call L and N.\n\nIn August a really tramuatic event happened between me and C (which i wont get into) which mentally affected the both of us really badly and lead to us not being able to see eachother or speak to eachother for a week. Which at the time really sucked because my whole friend group was worrying about her (me included) and especially A. Since I had literally nobody else to talk to, I ended up speaking with A alot, and found out she's been  manipulating C this entire time just so that she can make C “less wierd and more normal”. A day after she told me this, she went to visit C and convinced her to break up with me.\n\nNow I was not mentally prepared nor ready to break up with C seening as our relationship lasted like fucking 4 weeks. And so i tried convincing her to stay with me but she wouldn't budge. And so I went into a deep depression (which I'm still in) because I'd just lost all contact with a girl i genuinely felt comfortable talking to. \n\nNow in September Somehow A has also convinced L and N that im not worth hanging out with. And since A and C hang out anyway, they thought it better to have 4/5, not like i mattered much to them anyway i was always kinda an outsider in that friend group. Even when i was around them theyd usually make fun of me for being Jewish and other stuff which hurt me lots. So they left and had quite literally 0 FRIENDS. No acquaintances, no online friends, no NOTHING. I have somehow reached the final boss of loneliness.\n\nWorst part about this for me is watching C change from a sweet, quirky and kind girl to this more mean, judging, preppy girl. I feel like she isn't true to herself anymore, she's straighted her once pretty curly hair which she always said she liked, she's put on more makeup and removed the purple highlight she had in her hair. Even her sexuality changed. It's wierd having to see her at school looking and acting so different. It also gives me Anxiety even glancing in her direction.\n\nLike to know what you guys think of this?",

I feel like Im breaking mentally and only get some piece back..most just shatter on the ground. My mental health changed so much which completely changed my outlook on life. How can somebody enjoy life (under these circumstances)? It just feels like an endless cycle of suffering. I “tried“ to end it once but I failed. I know that I can’t do it…but the thought of (an early) death in the future feels weirdly relieving. If I’m able to do it at some point in the future…..",
