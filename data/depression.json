        "Text": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

        "Text": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

The “functional” kind, though—like, overachieving type. But about two years ago, I did a full 180 and became completely mentally (and physically) useless. I’m talking bedridden, can’t do basic daily tasks, energy level of a Victorian child with tuberculosis useless.\n\nMy energy is below zero, no matter what I eat or what vitamins I take. I’m tired 24/7. I’ve tried a ton of meds (not all of them, but feels like it), see a therapist regularly, and my health checks (thyroid, iron, etc.) all came back normal. So, as far as I know, it’s not a physical health issue. Just… brain stuff.\n\nHere’s the thing. Because I’ve spent so much time lying in bed, my body has basically wasted away. I wasn’t a gym rat or anything before, but I walked a lot and did yoga, so I was decently fit. Now, I can’t even walk to the market 10 minutes away without feeling like my heart is about to escape through my nostrils. I even ended up in the ER twice after slightly longer trips because my body was like “n o p e.”\n\nHere’s where I need your help: Is anyone else in the same boat? How did you deal with the whole “going from 100 to 0” thing, along with the self-disappointment that comes with it? And, if you somehow managed to claw your way back to functional—or semi-functional—do you have any tips?\n\nI’m looking for anything to help. Humor, advice, or just stories of others who’ve been there would mean the world. Thanks. 💙",

Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.\n\nWhen I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.\n\nLong story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.\n\nSo this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",

Because I changed so much I just see no future where this will be ver a possibility again. Maybe when I was younger and more beautiful but now? I repulse myself, how could a man love me? I thing the best thing is to end my suffering but how do i come to terms with that? Never experiencing a romantic relationship? My heart really aches when I see two people kissing or holding hands in public. I want to cry and scream because it seems so unfair, that some people experience such love and some don't.

At the age of 5 I was reading books like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. I was able to do mental math questions (3 digit by 2 digit multiplication problems) off the top of my head in a second. This kept developing as I continued to grow up and I got into things like chess, books, science, and just being a kid as well. Playing with my brothers, having fun, and being a kid. \n\nAll this started taking a turn about two years ago as I guess I just got into a spiral of bad luck. November 19, 2022, I got my first concussion playing basketball. Soon after everything felt normal and I was ok to continue playing and eventually didn’t play basketball for a team after that season. Then on November 10th, 2023, I somehow got another concussion while playing basketball for fun this time and after that one I soon felt normal but definitely noticed some changes in everything. The whole thing about this is that each time I was given no medical advice from the hospital or my doctor other than the fact that i’ll be good in a week. They told me nothing else and nothing else at all. My parents also just thought of concussion as something slight and me hearing this at a young age I was like ok that’s good news. The thing is life continued on and I never thought about my concussions again. Up until 2 months ago where I somehow gained a new headache and a whole return of concussion symptoms. I felt terrible for weeks and it was the exact same feeling but worse. I had another injury (not to my head) almost two months before the resurgence and I got worried it was that  injury that caused it. So me and my parents went to the doctor and I talked to them, they told me it wasn’t a concussion or anything concerning a concussion and it was just depression, lack of sleep, and anxiety which didn’t make sense to me but I went with it. \n\nPoint is for the last two months  i’ve had these small hits/bumps to my head and as a result my anxiety has continued to increase about them and Inkeep trying to push through as my family keeps telling me nothing is wrong with me and I’m just worrying and that it’ll all go back to normal. I just turned 16 like 3 days ago but I know that i’m not as smart as before. I’ve developed aphantasia which has basically disconnected me from all my childhood memories or my past in general. I forgot the plot of basically every movie I ever watched with my family in the past. i can’t picture the characters in books even though i used to have vivid imagery. I don’t process things as quick anymore, I remember asking my brother for help understanding the plot of AOT. I still have the ability to do math I guess but i’m overall i’m not normal anymore. I’m socially awkward now when I used to not be. I’m in public and I can tell that i’m not moving normally. Like i’m not making the most efficient decision or when something goes out of expected order I get lost. Even just going into a grocery store has become overwhelming with alll the colors and items, i can’t shop for my parents anymore. I used to be a great public speaker, like I used to speak in front of my entire student body and give speeches/stories without issues. Now I can’t speak in class without losing thought or stuttering. Everything has changed drastically and there’s no way it’ll ever be the same again.\n\nEvery night I struggle to go to sleep, imagining what I could have been had If I played basketball, or if I never did those plays. I go to bed crying for hours, if I run into something about my childhood I just bawl and fall to my knees. Thinking about where I could have been. I see my brothers doing great at least and I’m happy for them, I hope they do the greatest in life and live for me because I only see one way out, which at the age of 16 really sucks. I did look forward to things like graduating, going to college and pursuing a great career while also having dreams of real estate, meeting an amazing girl, getting married and having kids one day but all that really has shut down now so I guess the only thing I can do now before I end it all is help other people avoid having to go what I went through in life. And as tommorow marks the two year point of all this, i keep imagining myself getting hurt over and over and imagine what could’ve been, it’s ok i see the way out, it’s scary and it’ll hurt my family but I can’t take it anymore.",

I always saw how my classmates or friends were and thought 'how are they so effortlessly funny.\" If I said a joke in class at 14, there would be crickets and radio silence. \n\nHowever, when I was 17, I was diagnosed with depression and I think it made me a bit more bland. I think I started saying really alarming things at times in a deadpan voice that it became funny. I'm almost 24 now and now people go put their way to tell me im funny. Therapists would say it too.I once made the guy on the suicide hotline laugh so much at a joke I made when I was 20 and he kept apologising for laughing. He said he couldnt help it and honestly I was flattered.\n\nA classmate who used to sit with me in class when i was 18 had a brief friendship with me when j was 21 and he said \"how have i not spoken to you, i forgot how funny you are\". Ive been told by someone else \"you're actually a joker, u come up with jokes so fast\"\n\nThe thing is, everytime i have been told im funny, i have been at rock bottom. The common denominator in all of these situations was that I was on the verge of suicide.\n\nMaybe depression made me have actual dark humour or maybe I just got a sense of humour with aging and I had more knowledge-Therefore more things to joke about. But honestly I think it was the depression because I've never been called funny until I had it. \n\nYh just a random thought",

When you don't have enough money to maintain yourself, it's gets worse to get out of depression simply because the surroundings are chaotic and the air is just so thick all the time. I feel like money makes it easier to be an asshole with materialistic distractions, then it feels like the urge to stop life gets delayed more and more, cause you can distract yourself with whatever makes you feel more human/belonging.   \n  \nEveryone says, to get out of depression, you need walks in free air, you need mountains and parks, you need to be surrounded by external places with positive people, you need to join activities you love, you gotta have new hobbies... That bullshit is so classist. It totally excludes us from poor countries, It's like, yeah buddy, I hate to break it for you, but plane trips are actually a big privilege, having the chance to have a safe place to have a walk is a privilege, have money to invest in your hobbies is a privilege. I'm not saying rich people don't have depression, I'm just saying that if I had money, I'd be getting high somewhere else in this world right now, I know most people around me would still be fake and self centered, but at least I'd not have to deal with this ticking bomb on my neck, almost exploding, to know that the next month is uncertain, to know that living in a house with mold is a prejudice to my health, to know that I almost cry everytime I go to the supermarket cause everything is so expensive. I feel like suicide is not actually a way for me because the chances of everything going wrong in the process and me having bad consequences from it and still staying alive are high, but damn how do I WISH so bad to go sleep and not wake up in the same poor life anymore. I just crave afterlife. I hate misery and I lived my whole life in it. Fuck it. ",

On the first day I get there 15 minutes early like they asked and instead of being called back at my appointment time, I’m left waiting an hour and 15 minutes with no communication with what’s going on until I go to the front desk. They tell me that the technician has an emergency. The next day is the same thing I’m left waiting a long time. Also, I’m not made aware of this at all but I have privacy concerns about the scanning area in the Florida location. There’s two scanners are two scanners with no doors for privacy or anything. The first day I don’t think anyone else was in the second scanner that I wasn’t on, but the second day someone was and my privacy was violated during my appointment. It would’ve been nice to know that before coming.\n\nToday I had the call with the doctor. The doctor’s name was Dr. Rodriguez. It started off bad because he was very dismissive and rather rude. He invalidated me, and told me that I catstrophize and perceive how people look at me or if someone is mad or upset with me, which is far from the truth. I felt very dismissed the whole time talking to him! He’s the reason why I lost trust in medical professionals and it’s really sad. Nobody should have to go through this and feel this way in a doctor’s appointment or an appointment with any medical/mental health professional!!!",

I normally pride myself in being every bit calm and happy at work, with coworkers and so on, I don't want them to ever hear me rage, cry or whatever. But when I heard that a time I raged on a game when I thought I was muted, and then hearing them talk about WEEKS after. Means they probably fucking found it funny. My glasses broke at that time as well.  And I just...yeah, it can be seen as an exaggeration but you have to realise, my image of myself I presented to them and kept up for 2 years shattered and I exposed my real self for only a moment. And I can't get It out of my head. I just wanted to end myself repeatedly. \n\nI'm barely keeping it all together. My nerves are all over, I get angrier quicker.

But now all I want to do is go bed and sleep, don't eat and just drown in my self hate. \n\nThe reason I got sick is literally because I didn't eat right at all for a day, probably eating something off without caring. Little to no food and drink, and then violently vomiting the next day. Till I'm so fucking weak. I haven't vomited in literally 5 years till then.\n\nI'm losing it.

We are all skeletons without meaning to most people. Our personalities and everything about us gets lost.

        "Text": "I can’t hold a job. I just can’t. Which is horrible because I live alone and pay all my bills entirely on my own, so I really don’t have a choice.\n\nI started becoming an unreliable employee about 2 years ago. I worked the worst job I ever had—most physically demanding, warehouse environment so it was long days, no days off, horrible atmosphere, etc—and I called out of that job left and right just because I hated it. And it was an hour away from home, so even for a little cold or something I’d be calling out.\n\nBut now I’ve worked two other jobs since that weren’t demanding at all and I’m still unreliable. The last one was a call center where I literally sat all day and did nothing. I was still late every day, calling out all the time, whatever. But then I found out I had a serious underlying health issue and had to leave the job anyway, so I was out of work for months and just felt so guilty.\n\nI finally pick up another job a month or two ago, and this one’s a work-at-home job so I figured with the health issues I started having it would be much more accommodating. My computer is literally 5 feet from my bed. There’s no reason why I should be late. Even if I’m super sick, I shouldn’t be calling out because no one’s gonna see me, I don’t have to drive anywhere, etc.\n\nBut guess what? I’ve called out like 3 times already! What the fuck is wrong with me.\n\nThe first time I was truly beyond sick to my stomach and there was no way I could’ve made it through the work day speaking to customers. The second and third time I claimed for it to be the same reason because I felt if I told the truth I would’ve probably been fired right then and there, but the truth was that my life has been completely turned upside down by a recent event and my depression is eating away at me. I cry all day and all night. I suffer from dark thoughts. I want to check myself in somewhere, but ironically don’t want to miss work and risk getting fired because I NEED to keep a roof over my head.\n\nIve suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, truly before I ever had a reason to have it. And as I grow older, it becomes more flagrant. I hit rock bottom over and over and over again. I have no friends, no family, no goals, no talents, nothing to live for and it makes me depressed. So deeply that everything suffers from my work, my schooling, any friendships or relationships I’ve ever had, everything. My hygiene, the unkempt mess of my home, my car is like a rolling trashcan, all of it.\n\nIt makes me hate myself. I feel lazy. I just can’t pull my mental together to be a good worker. I will never hold a job and I put my living situation at risk every time I do stupid shit like this. But I just can’t do it anymore. The overarching thought that everything I do in my day-to-day amounts to absolutely nothing. I will never hold a fulfilling life and I think that is largely what makes me have 0 ambition or motivation to go to work when I’m late like I am, or call out like I do. And honestly a lot of times I will suck it up and go to work, and spend the entire shift having people ask why I’m so monotone, why I look so tired, what’s wrong with me etc., and I’ll think to myself every minute that I should’ve called out and regret having not done it. That id rather lay in bed, sleep and pretend I’m not alive than muster up a fake persona and use what little energy I’ve got in me to gain a paycheck.\n\nI don’t know how to get better. I’ve been in therapy for years, I’ve been on various medications for years, I’ve spent time in the psych ward so many times and I don’t know how to get better. Everyone else seems to do simple things like going to work just fine. I feel like a failure. I don’t have a support system so it’s all me trying to figure this out. Sometimes I’ve thought about just applying for disability, but I’m pretty young so I don’t think I’ll ever qualify. I just want to give up.",

I have no urge to self harm, I’m not sad, I don’t even really feel very depressed. Usually I blame myself, as most of us do, but not this time around.\n\nWhat’s happening now, is I had the thought “well if I don’t make it to the success I want to by the time I’m thirty, I may as well.” And getting more common now too is “ugh. Life just seems like a lot of work and I just don’t wanna.” \n\nSuicide layaway, not a good thing for sure, but I’m not used to feeling calm about suicide. I’ve also never accepted the fact that I don’t want to go on the way I have been.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else is just super apathetic towards life and death, cause I know I’m not a burden and stuff I don’t feel that way at all. Life is simply inconvenient and I don’t know if I want to keep trying I suppose, doesn’t seem worth the effort. \n\nTo me this doesn’t seem like a problem, but my roommate and partner seem horrified.",

Kids are too loud, bills are too much, dogs need vet care, vehicles breaking down.....\n\nI'm the only financial provider. My wife has advanced degrees, but her pay didn't keep up with childcare costs. She has said since she quit she was going to start he own thing, but hasn't done anything about it. She will sometimes complain that she doesn't have her own money. I give her money every month for incidentals and I pay all the set bills and 90% of the food and gas, going into a little debt to make ends meet. \n\nAny issue that arises with maintenance on the house or vehicles is but upon me to DIY fix it. I'm not a mechanic or plumber or carpenter or electrician, but because of financials I'm expected to just figure it out.  Then I usually got told I should have done this different or better or its not perfect. I know its not perfect, if it was perfect I'd be charging other to fix things, \n\nWe own a house that worth 2.5 times what we paid for it 6 years ago. We couldn't afford the house at todays prices. That's the only way we are able to live in this area is because we happened to but at the right time. We live near some of her family so the kids have cousins around, but we have no help with the kids from any family. We do everything 100% on our own. No real friends that we can ask for help as they have their own issues.\n\nMy job is fine. Small family owned company with no room to move up. I'm okay with that. I have an excellent schedule where I can go to all the kids events and take off if I need to. In order to move to a different company I'd work twice as much for a 10% raise so not worth it.\n\nAs I type this out I know I shouldn't feel as bad as I do, but I can't help it. I've been on antidepressants for about a year and they take the edge off a little, but sometime I get a huge overwhelming sense of dread and foreboding like my world is about to come apart. I don't know what would help or make things better. Maybe it will make me feel better just to get these things out and written down. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant. \n\n ",

I’m on disability(schizo-effective/bipolar), so would have made enough for bills etc.  Now, it’s too late and am planning on putting my money in interest income.  So, in like 15-20 years, I should be able to buy a house and move out, but until then, I am stuck in my parents house, with a very small and boring life.  No chance for a relationship and hiding my drinking from them just like I did in my early 20’s.  It’s basically a living nightmare that I wake up to everyday.  Plus, I drink enough everyday to practically guarantee that I might not even live to 65, so I may never actually be able to move out ever.  The only thing I have going for me atm is that I am not actively suicidal.  Although, that could change in the blink of an eye.  I just don’t know how I’m going to make it.",

        "Text": "At the start of the year, I found myself at my lowest, trapped in a world of absolutes and extremes. Alone on a bridge in the dead of night, I wept. I despised myself, unable to comprehend why I was the way I was or how everything had gone so wrong. Sleepless nights led me there, but I said goodbye to no one. I couldn’t jump, though perhaps the bridge wasn’t high enough, or perhaps I just couldn’t summon the courage. I went home feeling like a coward, too powerless to take control over even the one decision that felt like mine: ending it all.\n\nTime has passed since that night. As I sit here writing, I understand myself and the world better now. The pain that once cut so deeply has dulled, but it feels like I’ve never fully healed, like my understanding has trapped me in the same dark well I stood in at the year’s start. I long to return to the person I was two years ago, before that night shifted something in my soul. Yet I fear I’ll never be the same.\n\nYou are everything, and everything is you, but what’s the point of everything? In the end, everything is nothing. What’s the point of ending your life, of extinguishing all that is and all that was? You are the center of your universe, until you’re not. You may feel lost now, but eventually, you’ll find yourself again. Whether that discovery brings greatness or despair is yours to decide.\n\nEnough yapping, if you’re feeling suicidal, I’d recommend reading *The Book of Disquiet* by Fernando Pessoa (you dont even have to read all of it, you can just read the first 12 pages and see how it makes you feel). It’s not a self-help book, that stuff doesnt work. But if you feel you’ve nothing left to lose, give it a read before making any final decisions. It may resonate with you, might even “save” your life, or give you a new perspective on things. ",

And how you've been able to overcome these sudden manic depressive episodes.\n\nI gave myself a massive black eye the other day after drinking too much and being alone for too long. I lose the ability to cope and just start punching myself and slamming my head against the wall until the pain is too much. I did the same thing around this time last year and ended up taking all of my anti-depressant medications after punching myself repeatedly and slamming my face against the wall. My GF found me at home and dragged me to the hospital while I was unconscious. She's the only reason I'm alive today.\n\nSome days I really wish I just took a few more pills and maybe I wouldn't still have to be here dealing with this and being a burden on the ones I love. Some days I wish I could just be an in-patient again and not exist in society anymore, and waste away where no one can see me.\n\nJust leaving my dog at home for work makes me feel an immense guilt that I cannot shake throughout the day. Even when someone else can watch her, I feel like a failure because I know she doesn't know if I'll ever come back. I feel as though I am abandoning her. So it makes it even harder to ever leave the house.\n\nTherapy has never worked for me over the last 25 years. Same with the ridiculous amounts of medications I've tried. I still end up spiraling and before I even recognize it, I'm on the floor sobbing and punching myself again and again and again. My GF is out of town, so the only other people who have seen my face are coworkers. And even then, only one person has asked what happened. I lied of course. But it still is funny how uncomfortable it clearly makes people feel around me.\n\nI honestly just don't know what to do anymore. It's a vicious cycle that I know comes around and around again and I have no control over it. The only thing that stops me is thinking about how badly it would affect my GF when she finds me, and how badly it would affect my dog, sitting in a room with a dead body and being all alone again. I fear those things won't hold up in my head next time, and I'll go for the pills to end it. I never get strong enough to fight it, even when I'm aware it's happening. Looking at myself with all these bruises on my face just makes me sick of me even more.",

I lost my scholarship due to an administrative error (even if I've solved the problem by now), I missed a ton of classes, too.\n\nI'm trying so hard to fit in, but I don't think I can do it anymore.

Eating is such a fucking chore since I've lost all my appetite, and no food tempts me anymore. I don't have the strength to confide in my friends or mother about my struggles, or even to engage in discussions with them. A year ago, I started creating a fantasy world for my own enjoyment, but now I'm considering throwing everything in the bin, because I have lost all confidence about being able to do it. I feel like I'm worthless, a waste of space and ressources.\n\nWhat's even the point of it all? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week, after which my sick leave is over.

Like nothing comes to my mind and it goes blank, so I just sit there and observe, but do people try to talk to me either? Hell no they don't. I just don't know what to ask nor really care about knowing anyone. I am so lonely, sad, depressed, miserable, angry, all of the above, that I have no motivation to do any work and don't care if I fail. It sucks because I'm attending college for free, which I'm thankful for, but I HATE being here. I hate seeing everyone out with their stupid friend groups, friends in general, eating meals together, studying, walking together, talking, whatever it may be. Seeing others having what I don't and having a better time than me pisses me tf off. I'm so angry that I don't have it I hate everyone and everything. I resent them. Not to mention, I know if I put myself out there I wouldn't make any friends. It's just a load of BS anyways. I'm tempted to just drop out and say F it. Idc anymore and I'm over everything. Not having a good time in college, not knowing what to major in or do with my life makes me just want to end it all. I'm sick of everything! I've tried therapy and medications, it doesn't work either. No one can help me and I'm done being here.",

My face is ugly I’ve tried and spent so much money for my acne and nothing has worked and is getting worse I try to gain weight and I can’t I feel skinny even when I do go to the gym I see no progress. I look at other people and I wish I was them I feel short compared to people, I only wear long pants to school even in the hottest days because I hate the way my legs look. I question my self almost daily why can’t I get what I want? Not in money or anything else wise, but as body goals and I quite literally over it wasting so much time on myself just to be ugly. Why can’t nothing work out for me I can’t keep doing this. I have a habit of compare myself to others and most days I don’t even like what I look like when I look in the mirror, I really need someone to talk to about myself, sorry if it sounds selfish but why do I have to be born like this. Sorry if any of this doesn’t make sense I’m typing as my mind speaks. I’m 5,5 and I weigh 54 kg. why can’t I gain weight? Why do I have to have a fast metabolism? Why do I have to spend so much money on acne products to still have acne? Why do I have to be short? Why did I have to be born? I hope I soon meet recovery and see myself for who I am but now is not the time I really hate myself so much I just wanna cry but I can’t it infuriates me to be me…",

I feel like laying in bed all day or walking in circles in the park. nothing seems appealing, I don't know when I'm dreaming and when I'm in real life. I blame my old teachers for my situation today as they were the ones to tell me \"Shut up and be quiet\" . Also life is becoming more and more faded, I feel like what I am seeing is not real and I often see my self in third person, not to mention my brain seeing things that shouldn't exist. I also have a bad sleep schedule leading mostly to me sleeping in the morning. I want to go back in time to 2020 o before because I felt good back then my teenage years have so far been the worst years of my life. Every passing year I say to myself \"ok this is the worst year of my life, it can't get worse\"  and I'm pretty sure i've repeated this sentence hundreds of times over the last 4 years. Oh, and let's not forget about school and all of it's glory. The pressure is mental. My mum is always arguing with me and that's certainly not good for my Awful mental Health.

What’s hilarious is we had a lot of fight and were not even close before I became a adult. They used to be components that contributed to my desire to commit suicide. But after I graduated from high school, they gradually became more calm, showing their care and love, and pay my tuition for studying abroad now. I can’t deny that they care about me, I owe them, and it will be a cruel thing for they to lose their only child.

Anyway the doc told me I’m depressed after the first appointment and prescribed me antidepressants, in some way I’m grateful but it’s weird, it’s like I’m getting half the help I need, my parents think I have to take them because of some hormonal unbalance and told me not to say anything because people would think I’m “too sad” and will pity me. \n\nI’m just so done with everything involving me I just want this to end, I don’t want to exist anymore.",

Towards the end of it as I'm about to go home, I notice my ex fling (who I go drinking with sometimes, has a kid with someone but all very secretive) has spammed my insta inbox and asked me to go over. Turns out she's drinking 2 streets behind me. So anyway I go over thinking of continuing to party as we just party together these days - it's like 3am.\n\nBy the time I get there she was on the street, stumbling, super drunk and some stranger dude off the street was kind of helping her stand. Anyway that was no particular drama as he headed off the moment I came.\n\nShe tells me she wants to go home so I'm like ok whatever and eventually get a cab for her and take her back to her home. She gets all emo at some point in the can - I'm pretty drunk too so my memory is hazy - and she shows me she's been slitting her wrist. Wounds were fresh looked less than 3 days old as still bright red, from her wrist up to almost her elbow. At that point im pretty drunk from my own date too (been drinking since 7pm) and shocked, and she couldn't coherently tell me why she did that.\n\nAnyway I drop her off and next day wake up and notice I've got nail mark scratches on my neck. I text her and neither of us can remember what happened either but she denies having scarred me. Doesn't really matter.\n\nI've known her for 6-7 years and never knew she has tendency to cut herself (knew her when she's around 20 and she's now 27). I thought she's a pretty strong willed person. Should I be concerned about her? Is this something just girls her age does and it'll pass. Or is it unusual enough I should be alarmed. Is it a bad idea for me to still be involved in any way let alone show up in her life?",

Everyday I wake up and I wish I never woke up, I wish I died in my sleep. I just want to sleep forever and stay in a bubble for eternity. I genuinely don't know how much longer I can't hold on for. And honestly, I feel so numb to everything in my life. I'm 13 and in the 8th grade, I'm always worrying about my future, what I'll be when I grow up but honestly I don't know. I don't think I'll ever know. I feel so useless like a piece of junk taking up space. I have some hobbies but in honestly too tired to pursue anything. I want to go home, but when I think of home, I can't think of anywhere. I have always had to move to place to place because my families finical situation is so bad. I never had anything to call home. My home is nonexistent. My life is meaningless in all aspects, I don't think I've done any good or any bad in this world. I pretend I care about things but honestly I just don't care at all. I don't even been to be rude, I just don't. If I died tomorrow on the way to school, I wouldn't care. I have zero real connection with any human being and all of my friends. I don't feel anything for them. I feel alone in my own bubble. I want to die. I've been thinking of multiple ways of going about it. I haven't lived long so I know my death won't be a big deal except for my family but I will be forgotten never thought about ever again, like dirt, there will just be one less mouth to feed. Well, to me I wouldn't be a problem...I have my younger brother, hes a year younger than me, I dont want him to care for me, but if I die. Who will protect him? Who will care for him? Would he care if I died? But, sometimes I think of the future, maybe I think a bit too much. I see nothing but darkness. Its so cold and empty here. But, I wonder if one day...ill meet someone who will bring just a little light into my life. A partner, a friend, someone, anyone, who will hear me. If I go to heaven, would I regret not living my life to see how I would've went? Maybe I'm just too dumb and young to understand what I'm feeling and I probably don't make sense. I don't even know why I'm writing this or even posting this. But, I just thought to type my thoughts out. I'll have to wake up tomorrow for school. \n\nI want to go to sleep.\n",

I feel like I should end it now and disappear while I'm still happy in one aspect before the debt overtakes me.

They are the single greatest thing in my life, they helped me not hate myself, they helped me loose weight and become healthier. But my depression from everything else weighs so heavy on me, and they could move on if I weren't around. Everyones life, my family and my partners would benefit from me being gone. ",

I started college in 2016 right after hs. I’ve tried my best to get into the nursing program by retaking classes, scoring higher, begging professors to give me chances/recommendations. However was weight listed and then denied at my university. \n\nIt’s fine, I took 2 years off to recover mentally. However coming back to school I was doing extremely well. I got my GPA up and was accepted into a different program. \n\nThis is where I’m debating: \n\nI hit my half way point of finishing in this new program and I failed my exam by 10% making me become dismissed from the program. (Yes it’s that strict) \n\nI feel like all my hard work went down the drain. I feel hopeless and stupid watching all my friends succeed without me and feel like offing myself is the only way out from embarrassment. \n\nChat, what should I do?",

Did I mean everything…yes, can I expect any different… no) but I was middle management (construction company) and was in charge of about 7-8 kids between 20-24 year olds. None of them had life figured out, they wouldn’t show up to work, they couldn’t complete work, I’d write them up but my boss is in charge of actual punishment so nothing would ever happen no one would  ever fire anyone, our phones were so old we couldn’t update them anymore so features on apps we used on work phones wouldn’t work because the IOS was far behind. Couldn’t get basic things like ladders or material when you needed to without going threw a bunch of beucracy just to get denied by my boss and then your just sitting there like WTF do I do. I got called in and as soon as he said “I heard you said this about me” something clicked and I went “yeah your horrible leader and I don’t want to work here” and he went “well that works out great cus you don’t, turn in all your shit” and I left. I was going to my buddies house to go drink some beer to drown my sorrows. I saw a dude on the side of the road welding a metal fence and clearing land I pulled over and asked if he needed help. I helped for a min and asked if he needed someone to do work for him, I can operate a skid steer and weld and he told me I can start Monday it’s subwork at 300$ a day (I’m getting 1099’d) and I have a new job. All of my stress and issues and having to worry about what’s going to go wrong this week and what shit show I would walk into every morning at work, getting chewed out for stuff I can’t control, it’s all just gone. Like huge weight is just gone, I in the matter of 4 hrs of getting fired from a job I worked at for the last 10 years, just feel like I’m starting a whole new life. And it’s amazing. Idk how to explain it. I’m going to do this fencing thing for a min but I have all my qualification to get licensed and start my own company, this is first time in I’ve had an actual plan in life, there something to work for. I last week had been in a multiple year slump and was just never going anywhere and getting fired is just fired me back up and gave ambition I haven’t felt since I was a kid. ",

I act whoever my friends act, laughing like an idiot in class or just being overall unbothered by anything. I have no personal principals besides what is considered okay in society,if perhaps something doesn't resonate with me I don't care to disagree, I just don't care about anything. I don't know who I wanna become so I just start doing dumb shit because I don't have a clear path. Yesterday, I got drunk and smoked like 4 cigarettes ( I quit almost 2 years ago and never smoked a cigarette since) and I wouldn't say I feel bad, but rather feel the need to end this cycle of personality traits and habits . After my ex-girlfriend left me, I started talking a lot, I keep talking about myself and everything that happens I ask my classmates (Is it okay, have I said anything wrong/ how did I look?) about it. I am so mean to people, I usually say things not so well thought or if I say anything well thought I feel like I am a robot, not actually meaning what I am saying. I talk a lot during class/during break and I can't seem to shut up and can't actually do anything alone. For example, when I am walking home from school I always feel the need to have somebody with me. I hate it! I don't feel independent and usually when I end up home, I overthink about my life, but with a very weird train of thought. I say that I am not going to speak anymore at school so much and that I will become more serious ( rarely happens), but when I do I fell like I did the same even though I didn't. What can I do? ",

Today I got him for the second time in a while to the point to 'invite myself over' to cook for both of us, without pushing for deep conversations, just providing a steady, non-judgmental presence and allowing him to feel a little less alone in his struggle. No hard conversations if he doesn't feel like.  \nNow, I’m thinking of leaving him some little notes (like post-its) scattered around his apartment before I leave – just simple messages to maybe lift his mood, even if it’s just for a second. I want to offer something small that could break his negative thought cycle for a moment and maybe make him smile. I’m not sure what kind of messages would be helpful, though.  \nWhat could I write on these post-its? Do you think it's a good idea? What would help you, what kind of post-it-messages?  \nThank you so much for your help and ideas! 💙",

Since then, I've been on and off anti depressants, though I'm currently not on them. This was due to my OCD. My obsessive thoughts just kind of took over my entire mind, causing bad anxiety attacks. I can't seem to stop or control them no matter how hard i try. I moved back in with my parents and took up a job at my dad's office. \n\nThe episodes come and go, but of late, it's taking a toll on my mind. I hate waking up. I get to the office, and I can barely get anything done as I'm constantly fighting my mind. The job is mentally strenuous with deadlines,  and we're abit short handed at the moment. So I not only have to get my work done, which is an uphill task in itself, I also have to get other people's work done.\n\nI want to take a break but everyone around me is telling me to just hold on, because I'm apparently living everyone's dream of inheriting their parent's job, and that I should consider myself lucky.\n\nWhile I appreciate all this, it feels shitty not being able to get work done, and other employees thinking you're taking advantage of your position because you work for dad. Before this, I was very industrious, doing what was expected of me and more, and barely making any mistakes.  My parents are stressed because I don't seem to be getting better.\n\nNow it's like my life went downhill, and i just graduated. I can't catch a break from my mind, day and night. I'm tired, drained, and I can't take a break.  I can't seem to find a way out. I can't talk about my depression to anyone else because all I get is \"you should consider yourself lucky\"  \" you should be better by now \" so I feel guilty for not being okay in the first place. I at least have this space to vent my emotions. I wanna go away and never come back.",

Every single conversation is an argument and it kills me, two good people who are ruining each other day by day.\n\n I have two sisters who are much older and that makes us very disconnected. They never initiate a conversation, they never tell me anything about their life. There used to be a time when I was desperate for their attention, for a relationship I longed for, for a relationship I'd see other siblings have. But I've given up now. \n\nI lost all my friends because of a stupid shit that I did- I had to change schools, come home back again(I was in a boarding school) and now even if I want to I can't make friends for the life of me. I always push everyone away. My anger and trust issues always coming forward. A girl in my new school spread rumours about me that I was a lesbian just because I came from a girls hostel. I love in a very small town and while I don't have anything against the LGBTQ community everyone else does, so noone talks to me now. I know they laugh behind my back, talk about me, make fun of me. \n\nI am so so exhausted and never have the energy to do anything which makes me feel like a burden- a useless heap who's just wasting her father's money. My parents are both 50+ and sometimes say or do things without meaning to that hurt me. \n\nI used to trust my sisters but I can't even talk to them anymore. I don't trust them, I have convinced myself to hate them. I tried to trust them, to tell them what I was feeling at times. But their words unintentionally always made me feel lying dying even more than I already did. I am done with everything. \n\nAnd I know, I get it, these things are common that most go through and maybe I am just overreacting. I know. But I can't help it and that's on me. \n\n\nEDIT: I can't anymore. I am done with hearing my parents fight every second of every day. They fight, get frustrated and as if their fighting doesn't hurt already,  I am the one being screamed at. I see my mother crying almost everyday and most of the time because of me. Because of how unresponsive i am all the time. Furthermore I am done feeling like I am constantly doing everything wrong. That everything is my fault. I question everyone's intention because I can't trust anyone for the life of me. I have no one. No one to go to and tell how happy or sad I am today. No one to go to and tell when I win a competition or generally anything I am proud of. No one to go and tell how shitty my day was because somehow it's always my fault. It's always me. And everything I do is wrong.",

I need therapy but can't afford it. I know I know there are options supposedly I just don't have the energy for shit like that, hell I can barely take care of myself physically as my teeth continue to rot. honestly don't even know where I'd find time for it, since my days are so filled with dread and work, and looking for work because I'm a broke AF bitch who can't even go out somewhere for fun because it costs money. Then I see people who get to do all the shit I wish I could and never will like concerts, or movies, or dancing, or traveling and it's like what's the point? I grind 2 steps and fall back 3 or 4. I haven't done anything meaningful in my adult life and every time I trick myself into believing that I could or life is finally going my way the rug is yanked out from under me.

I currently live with them and they do so much to try and make me happy and show they care.\n\nMy mom works a day care job, and after work, she will literally cook me some of my favorite dishes even when she's exhausted. My dad will always ask me how I'm doing and whether everything is okay pretty much everyday. When it comes to my creativity, they are my biggest fans. They are always eager to hear new songs I've made or read new poems I've written. And they'll even post my songs on all their social medias, boasting to their friends how creative and talented their son is. They'll also randomly buy me gifts sometimes, like clothes without me even asking. They will always shower me with encouragement and compliments, always trying to uplift me and build my confidence.\n\nWhen I'm sad, it ruins their day. They genuinely hate to see me upset. They are always willing to hear me out and let me vent to them, and they try their hardest to understand and provide guidance.\n\nOverall, these are the best parents I could have ever asked for.\n\nBut I'm a shitty son and I don't deserve them. I only have a few months with them before I officially move to a whole new city. \n\nBut I've been dealing with a lot of depression recently and it's made it extremely difficult for me to enjoy my time with them and be happy around them. I work a great job and earn decent money, I am healthy and have a nice physique, I have hobbies like reading and writing, and overall I'd say I'm a good looking guy. But I have pretty much no friends - my friends that I used to have all became extremely toxic and I wasted a decade spending time with them. Now I have no one. And the acquaintances I have aren't willing to deepen their relationships with me; I'm just that guy they hit up once every few months. And dating has also been a shit show. \n\nBecause my parents are the only ones I can really talk to - I say some really depressing stuff around them. About how I feel like, besides my career, I have nothing in life. That I am destined to be alone forever and my life will be very lonely. I know that it hurts them when I say these things, but I can't help but say that stuff around them because I have no one else to vent to. And for that, I really am a shitty son because they're old and all they want is for me to be happy, but all I do is make them stressed and upset by being negative and ruining the vibe.\n\nI know I've been sabotaging my time with my parents by being depressed, but I just can't seem to help it. I already feel so defeated knowing how much time I've already wasted just complaining around them when I could've instead just used that time to have fun conversations with them or get to know them more.\n\nI hate my life and myself so much and I just don't know what to do anymore.",

        "Text": "Let me preface by saying I just turned 31 and have had high functioning depression for most of my teen/adult life so I feel like I’m experienced in accepting a lot of the hardships that come with it in a more passive (healthy?)way compared to my 20s when I self harmed and would have erratic emotional fits. I have gone through the whole therapist/medication BS but it always just happens to linger. I’ve had my fair share of losses, been treated like a second hand object, sexually assaulted by someone I thought I could trust, fake friends/family, etc. so I ruminate a lot and lose sleep wondering why people have treated me as such and wonder why I have to feel like this and it makes me feel a whole new level of lonely I’ve never felt before until recently. I’ve been told by strangers and the few people I do communicate with that I’m caring, funny, genuine, etc. but yet I see other terrible individuals have a wave of support yet I don’t and it makes me wonder what’s going on and if life really just isn’t as kind to some individuals? I struggle with this a lot in my later years now and have trouble finding ground with these thoughts of feeling ‘insignificant’ and constantly day dream of finding a few good humans to share life experiences with without having to worry about the woes. Does anyone here feel the same/and or have any coping mechanisms they could share? Any and all information would be appreciated! Expressing and interacting with others here on Reddit alone regardless of the topic has helped a lot as well. ",

I know I have some bad social anxiety so I didn’t think much of it because I usually calm down right after. I then went to a near by target to find the item again , I found it and went to checkout. Then I saw someone I knew again and that shot up my anxiety so I just scanned and left. On the way home I noticed I started to feel weird I wasn’t trying to think much of it, until I got home I noticed I felt a little unreal and just weird all around everything felt weird to me I went inside to try to distract myself but nothing helped I started to cry because I was very scared. The next day I felt better but then mid day I started to feel weird again then I started to cry again and noticed as three days went on I started to feel very sad and low mood and wasn’t really eating a lot. Around 2 weeks later I started to feel better at night feeling like myself again then 4 days later I started to feel better in the mornings and afternoon but still feel a little weird and I’m at that currently does anyone know what’s going on. I know it might be depression but I wonder if it’s situational depression because I never in my life had this happen to me. Forgot to mention the weather kinda changes my mood to. Thank you ",

I’ve spent my whole life looking to a future where I can love and support a family I built.

The best I could come up with was:  \nYou ever have a really rough day, and you get home, and you're totally exhausted, everybody and everything pisses you off, and you just need to lay on the couch with a significant other and let their presence recharge you. It's like that, except I'm the only one on the couch. And theres not going to be anyone else on the couch.

I always chose what feels good in the moment even if it's horrible and suffer for it later. I have so much self pity despite knowing how much a screw up I have been in my life. I drown myself in food, or porn, or whatever just to get a dopamine rush despite knowing it sucks afterwards. I genuinely am alone. For real this time. I'm in college, far away from my parents, not that I could over open up to them about everything, I have too much shame and guilt about the disgusting things I done, thought and said that I'd rather be dead then for them or anyone I care about to know. I have a therapist, but I could never tell them either because I just can never confess some things about myself, and I'm probably going to take them to my grave.

The last friends I had I completely ruined our relationship in barely 2 weeks and now they want nothing to do with me, which makes sense.\n\nI genuinely am a completely useless scumbag, I can't do anything right, I can never be the person I should be or who people need me to be.

I add nothing to the world, I don't know why I was given the right to live. Another child before me didn't make it, but I did, only for me to grow up to be a selfish liar, freud and failure.",

        "Text": "I'm 17, in the final year of mandatory education. I live in the UK and it's called year 13 here.\n\nI've been feeling really depressed since like April of this year, and it's only getting worse and worse as I go into my final year. I haven't been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure that I must have depression since I think about killing myself almost every day.\n\nI try to work sometimes, but my mind just fills with worries about my future. Like, people say that this last year is essentially living hell, and that it's the hardest academic year and whatever. Even though it isn't that bad right now, people saying this just makes me feel sick because how on earth am I gonna cope with that? I couldn't even work hard last year.\n\nEssentially, my main worries are just about life after 18. I just don't see the point in living after 18 sometimes, it just seems so miserable. I'm 17 right now, and I feel like I've wasted the last few good years of my life, I've essentially done nothing since lockdown. I feel so unprepared for adulthood, I just feel like crying everyday because I'm becoming an adult soon and can't stop it. When I think of having to get a job, move out, live by myself and be responsible for myself, I just break down and feel like killing myself for like the 4th time that day.\n\nEveryone else in my year just seems so happy and prepared in comparison. They all have jobs, they have their driver's licence, they're applied to uni and don't seem worried at all about life post-18. Like, how are most of them not worried? After this year you lose all your friends, move to a completely different city, and are forced to start over basically... I just want to keep seeing my friends every day during break and lunch, but that just isn't possible after 18. Everyone else gets good grades, or at least works hard, they probably also have some work experience and I have 0. I just wish I had done some within the last few years, I have no qualities that an employer would want, like literally 0, I have nothing going for me. No self esteem, awful work ethic, tired, like who would hire me? How am I going to cope with a job?\n\nI barely do anything outside of school, I just doom scroll and play video games, which doesn't help but what else can I do man. I'm unmotivated, undisciplined, tired all the time because I stay up late, etc. I just want to escape reality, escape the fact that my school situation is getting worse as the backlog of work increases.\n\nI don't want my life to change, I just want to remain a kid for the rest of my life, I don't want financial independence. People say \"But if you remained a kid, you wouldn't be fully independent, you'd have to be guided on how to live your own life forever.\" but that's literally what I want. I want to be guided my whole life because I'm incapable of guiding myself.\n\nSometimes I blame my parents for not raising me to be better, to actually feel independent and ready for adulthood. I've never had to do chores, my parents let me skip homework in primary school, and lockdown completely killed what remained of my work ethic and motivation. I was honestly a harder worker in year 7 than I am now, my work ethic is getting worse not better. All of this is probably just my fault for not working hard. My relationship with my parents in general is just getting worse and worse, with me staying up at night, losing my temper with them etc. I sometimes feel like their lives would be better if I was dead, and I'm probably right to be honest. They'd mourn me for a few months, but after it all, they'd be happier.\n\nI'm just starting to despise the world around me for making me who I am. I already mentioned this but every time I think of the future, of becoming an adult, I just feel suicidal. I don't see the point of living after 18 when I cannot even cope now, yet everyone else seems so ready for it.\n\nThis entire system just makes me so angry like why am I being forced to make decisions about uni? I'm not ready for this, why am I being forced? Why is everyone around me ready for it when I'm not? I feel like I have the mental age of a 13 year old or something, I just don't want my childhood to be over. It's not even just the fact that I cannot decide if I want to go to uni or not, what degree I want to do if I do go, or the fact that I'll have to get a job. It's the mere fact that I'm being forced to make these decisions myself that makes me so depressed, because I'm not ready to be responsible for myself. Yet, everyone says \"At 18 you're an adult! You're responsible for yourself!\" as if you magically become mature at 18, and as if 18 wasn't just an age some guy picked and decided \"yeah you become an adult here\".\n\nEven having to research stuff myself, decide how and when to revise myself, it just makes me feel so awful. I don't want to have to make those decisions. I don't want to be responsible for myself, but I seem alone in that opinion. Even other people on this sub, you guys just talk about uni applications as if it's no big deal, discuss your future goals, etc. How are you guys not completely worried about adulthood? I don't get it. I feel so immature every time I see a post talking about any school stuff, you guys are just so far ahead of me in life. I don't even have any future goals anymore.\n\nI might have ADHD too, but I'm not sure. I'm just so pathetic, life feels so hopeless right now.\n\nIt's not just current problems, I just feel like I've wasted my whole life. People my age talk about \"2016 summer was so fun!\" or 2019 or whatever, and then I think about my own summers. I can't remember many core memories of them, because I barely did anything during them, I just went on a 1/2 week long holiday and did nothing else. I've only just realized how much I missed out on as a young kid, like I've never even been to a sleepover it's pretty sad.\n\nAnyway if you've read this whole post so far then I thank you, and I'd appreciate some advice or even just an expression of understanding.",

I really liked the athletic part of joining the military. I’m just working a job I do enjoy, aimlessly, I don’t have a 5 year plan or anything. Even if I wanted to go back to school, I’m not sure I’m smart enough for it. I find it extremely intimidating (socially and educationally). I wish I had pushed through Bootcamp and graduated. 😭 ",

I ruin good times other people are trying to have, even when I’m keeping up appearances.

I feel as if they owe me my childhood since theyve taken it from me, by just being patient with me and acknowledging that i dont have any motivation or energy, and when i do, half of it goes towards things i enjoy doing instead of taking care of myself, so that i have a little something to keep going. they say im showing them i hate them by not cleaning my room and instead sleeping or talking to the only people that dont make me feel like shit (friends and family). i am hanging on by a thread and i only have energy to do things that promise me a little happiness. i have told them this, they said they dont care and that if other people can go on in their lives after adversities then so can i. i tried asking them to help me get therapy or meds and they said no for reasons unknown. they dont believe im capable of taking care of myself and dont believe im capable of taking care if anything or being reliable, even though its shown time and time again that its circumstantial and ive been really productive when im away from them for long periods of time. but they wont let me move out and i cant support myself. the main issue is, they keep taking things from me because im taking too long to clean my room. i have been picking up little by little every day but this is not satisfactory for them. they threaten to remove my door and throw away all my things. i am not allowed to see anyone anymore and i havent left my house in weeks. i cannot have a meal around them without feeling like shit. so i do not eat or eat in my room. i do not feel like cleaning or doing anything or getting up from bed even after these punishments. they threaten to show my family and in laws how i live and that im a burden to them. i do not have the energy to clean my room entirely in one day for the mess that it is. they threaten to take my phone and laptop and also take away food as a punishment. i want to find work but nowhere i know is hiring and even then im not sure what that would solve, since they also said they will throw away all my belongings if i work somewhere else instead of cleaning my room. i have tried to clean my room but i dont have enough energy to do much. they get angry and tear down things in my room sometimes and it makes me go days without getting up from bed and not putting in any effort to clean my room. what do i do.

I think about suicide and self harm on the regular now. Now it’s getting to where it’s almost a daily thing and it’s scaring me.\n\nI used to take antidepressants but they made my brain fog (from other conditions) so bad that it was unsafe. I’ve been through MANY sessions of CBT in my lifetime and am currently doing it again now. \n\nI HATE Christmas so the lead up to that isn’t helping at all. And I find myself becoming more emotional and having breakdowns and snapping or exploding on people when I feel triggered. I’m being evaluated as possibly having BPD too as I fit criteria for it. \n\nIt’s such a struggle right now because I don’t feel like I can truly be loved by people even though I have the best boyfriend and family ever! I just don’t feel worthy of happiness even though I’m kind and I try not to hurt or upset people (I’m a chronic people pleaser) \n\nI just find myself getting so upset and angry at the smallest things and then I fly into a rage episode where I scream and cry and shout… and wish I was dead and want to die in that moment but then an hour or less later I’m feeling ashamed of the way I reacted and embarrassed by it all. Then a depressive episode starts and now I’m stuck in one. I’ve tried distracting myself. \n\nI find that I’ll have a good day and then after that good day I ALWAYS get depressed when I get home or the day after said good day. I just see everyone getting on in life going out having freedom to leave the house whenever they want and I’m getting so fed up with life now. I just want to cry and isolate myself all the time. I don’t like going out because I have to rely on public transport as I cant drive and I hate public transport it makes me anxious to no end!\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for these passive suicidal ideations?

        "Text": "\nI keep trying to find good arguments against suicide, but I don't find any of them particularly insightful. Most of them seem to boil down to concepts of pleasure and pain. Example being, \"it's will get better\", meaning that you will feel pleasure again. Which is generally true, but why do we assume that a pleasureable life devoid of pain is worth living? It seems preferable to the alternative of a life of pain, but I would not assume that it inherently removes the problem of suicide.\n\nEven if ones life is good and happy, is there a convincing reason to assume that being happy automatically makes life worth living? Existentialists seem to argue that because life is inherently devoid of meaning, we get to define our own existence. They say that this gives us the ability to choose for ourselves, and that this makes life worth living.\n\nBut what about the ability to choose our path makes life worth living? No matter what one chooses, we all end up in the same destination. So the choice itself cannot the value, it must be the result.\n\nBut the argument that choice is valuable because we can try and become the best version of ourselves for it's own sake, seems like a sort of rat race. It seems to only serve as self interested ego masturbation, where we seek to compare ourselves with others. Why does the approval of others have value? Why does the approval of myself matter?\n\nAnd if the point of our own choices is to improve the world and those around us, that is even more hopeless. For one, why should I seek to improve the lives of those around me, most of which have no interest in my existence at all. I can only control my own actions, but the result of those actions is out of my control.\n\nEven worse, it seems this freedom of choice means that one should be completely within their rights to kill themselves preventing it to be a good arguments against suicide.\n\nMost arguments against suicide seem to boil down to a \"feeling\" that living must be superior to death, as a sort of philosophical axiom. But if one doesn't feel this, are they simply doomed to meaningless death? \n\nI don't find the myth of sysiphus and absurdist arguments that convincing either. This is more of an argument that helps people that already feel the desire to live. This seems to say that yes life is absurd but you should enjoy the ride, which is in essence an argument for pleasure. If one doesnt find life pleasureable, there is no reason for existance.\n\nSo for this argument to be convincing, I think it would need to \n\n1. Prove that a person should continue to live whether they have any desire to live or die, that ultimately living does have meaning regardless of their emotional state. That the purpose of existence does not rely on our inate desire for existence (even if this is the case for most).\n\n2. It needs to address the seemingly meaningless quality of worldy desires and primitive emotions, such as not using pleasure and pain as reasons for existing. The purpose of living cannot be found in the pursuit of pleasure, or in avoiding pain. The purpose of existence should transcend our personal emotions, and should have meaning in a more general sense.\n\n3. Not rely on the argument of \"If living and dying are both pointless, then you might as well live\". If you might as well live, then by definition you might as well die. If both options are equal, then living is not superior to death.\n\n(As a bonus, not rely on social connections between people as a reason for existence, such as love. This also seems to be an argument for pleasure, not an argument for purpose)\n\nSubjectively, i just hate being alive. I'm obese man with no friends, and really have nothing I look forward to. There is no reason for me to continue to exist, so I constantly look for something to prove that there is some reason for me to live. But I can't find it.",

Anyway, I just felt like saying that for those of us who see no real purpose in life and who gain nothing from being in the rat race even if they're  winning, I just wonder if connecting with others that just want to be with other people that recognize our true human condition snd have empathy for what we're all going through might be the solution.

Video games were all I had left really and I can't for the fucking life of me find any enjoyment in them anymore. My mind is stuck on the thought of ending it. Don't know how but I gotta go. The TV stays muted, only being used for light against my blacked out room. I fixed my favorite meal today and stared at it as it went cold then just threw it away. Tuesday I'll wake up, unfortunately, and go to work. I'll burn what little energy I have masking that I want to paint the world around me with my brain matter. Everyone and everything passes me the fuck off and I know it's not them, it's me, and that just makes me have myself more. I started the letters, but nothing will make sense to them. This world is shit. I don't have shit. All I've wanted is someone to come home to and know they love me, but why should I ask anyone to fix what I broke? Even the fantasy family in my head has gone. Can't even keep my imaginary family happy. Soon as I find the sure fire way to end it, without fucking up and making myself a life-long cripple, I'm fucking gone. Hopefully that happens soon cause I've been dead inside for longer than I can remember. Sometimes I want to blame my ex, but I know she just saw my inevitable failure before I could. So good on her for getting out. I don't even know why I'm writing this, I don't care to be here anymore. Just wish I could take everyone else's depression with me when I go. I'd trade my life in a second if it'd make this world not a fucking shithole. I'm gonna go walk in traffic and hopefully get hit by a semi. Thanks for letting me rant.",

Even when I feel mentally okay, I still don’t want to live. No matter what I do, I lose. I have learning disabilities and hearing loss. I can’t keep a job because of my processing disorder, my lack of social skills, and my hearing loss. Nobody ever sticks around in my life, and the ones that do stick around, feel pity for me, or see me as a burden. Even when I’ve had groups of friends, I’ve always been the tag along friend. Everything I say seems to be the wrong thing to say, everything I do seems to be the wrong thing to do. I’ve never socially adapted to any environment or group. I’m always broke. Nobody would miss me if I was gone, and I mean that. Every time I’ve ever tried to better myself and my life, I get screwed over. Even if I think I’m working my way up at a job, then I get fired out of the blue. Every time I think I have a real friendship, then they betray me. My family feels pity for me, and thinks low of me. I used to at least have my looks to count on, but now I’m just boring and basic looking. I wake up every single day feeling empty, and with a weight on my chest. I have no motivation, I can’t stick to plans or schedules, and I’m only barely alive at this point. I looked into MAid, but of course I don’t qualify. There is no purpose in anything anymore. I haven’t even had any actual hobbies in years bc I have so low motivation, and desire to keep living. I’m basically an empty shell of a person. I can’t connect with anyone anymore, I can’t connect with anything anymore. I simply exist. It’s past midnight , and I’m already dreading going to sleep and waking up all over again. ",

We have politicians and corporations that rule our lives that only think about what's best for themselves instead of their people, the price of living is insane, people work their entire lives away so they could maybe retire and have a good 10-20 years left of their lives when their old. I hate how smartphones and social media and the rise of technology have completely disconnected everyone from each other and we are losing our humanity because of it. Everyone is so lonely, isolated and depressed yet we still don't talk to each other anymore or do anything to change it.\n\n Instead we just bury ourselves into our phones and it makes things so much worse. Everything and everyone feels so cold and people live in fear. You go outside and everything is so lifeless now, no one goes out and socializes anymore because they can just stay on their phone nowadays. Places people used to go to socialize are dead, the mall is empty, you can't even go on the streets and talk to people without being labeled as weird. \n\nDating has just turned into an app nowadays which only a very small amount of people benefit off of it. Everything is just so artificial and cold nowadays compared to what it used to be and I absolutely abhore it. I think the people in charge know what they are doing and want us to be miserable so that they can benefit off of us. I just miss genuine human connection and companionship that feels harder and harder to come by. I would burn it all to the ground if I could and take back what they have taken from us. I can't put into words what burning hate I have for how miserable society has turned us all into, when are people gonna wake up and take back our lives because this isn't living. \n\nI want a real warm and genuine life full of connection, not this fast food, artificial bullshit that society is now that makes us isolated and lonely. Fuck you society, genuinely fuck you and the people who are befitting off our suffering. You have stolen my life away and turned my into this lonely isolated shell of myself and I am not the person I'm supposed to be because you stole my life. I genuinely hope that you burn in hell. Whatever life they created for us I don't want it, we have sold our souls and humanity away to technology. This is not normal, or the way humans are supposed to live. Wake up people.",

I can’t build up the courage to drive blood and every single time I try it feels like a useless attempt. I’ve tried starving myself, quickly relapsed into binging. I can’t force myself to purge. Being promiscuous doesn’t cut it enough for me. I have no access to drugs or alcohol because I’m not old enough so I can’t get high. I’m too ‘scared’ to actually inflict pain upon myself so self destruction will only extend so far. I’m tired of it. \n\nHealthy coping mechanisms don’t satisfy me either - besides watching movies. It’s the only thing I like doing to distract myself but it only helps so much. And sleeping. Half of my life is spent sleeping my days away, and I can only sleep for so long before I have to return to living. Hate it.\n\nI don’t know what I want. I don’t know what I’m doing with myself.

He explained that she had a blood clot and it wasn't in her brain but it was slowly moving into her brain and was slowing the blood flow to her brain. He called to ask me if I wanted him to remove the blood clot or else she would die. Obviously I said to remove the clot but I was not prepared for that question or her status to come. I brought my family including the children to visit her in the hospital. She was not looking well and my oldest was upset to see her like that. She passed away a few months later and I've just repressed everything because I have to keep calm and carry on. Although I'm not the oldest child, I was the closest to her so she her will made me in charge of everything. At some point in the past year I was really hoping my spouse would be there for me but work and the phone seem to be more important. I live a few hours away so I don't visit or go to my mother area but I still have friends there. A few weeks ago I went back to visit a friend because despite everything I'm trying to rekindle my relationship with my friend. It was weird being there, driving through the same roads I drove with my mom, and seeing the same places that we had been to together. On the way back home I tried to express my feelings and open up to my spouse but the conversation got sidetracked and I felt ignored, irrelevant, and unheard. A few days later we went out for breakfast. It was really bothering me so I brought it up again. Again the conversation changed to focus on my spouse and I felt worthless. After a week of just existing in the same house I texted what I had been feeling and how I was struggling, after all it was my mother that had died. I've never felt so alone. ",

But I'm 21 and still the same as ever🫠 still don't care about anything or anybody, still don't have hobbies or aspirations, I'm still anhedonic and apathetic. The things I'm trying to do only feel like obstacles to pass so I can go back to sleep and daydream again, not actual \"accomplishments\". So I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. I'm not suicidal, I do NOT want to die, but I'd rather die than live like this. My mom used to cry because I didn't care enough to hug her lol, but she's gotten used to me now. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if this is a result of me getting brain surgery. Nothing online says this could happen, but I used to feel things before I got my brain poked around with. I genuinely cared about my friends, I had goals for the future, I felt happy and just felt things in general😕 it sounds stupid to blame how I am on a brain surgery, because I'd hate for it to be that.. I had to get a surgery so I wouldn't die, but in exchange it took away my will to live?? Sucky",

        "Text": "Hey,\n\nTLDR:\nI'm 22M. I've been stuck in a cycle of depression, chronic loneliness, and mental health since I was 6. I dealt with suicidal ideation and attempts from 5-17 years old. Didnt have depression from 18-20, got amnesia & depression at 21, now depression again at 22. I'm tired of the cycle. I just want it to end. I go to therapy. I'm thankful I'm not suicidal, but I can see myself getting there. Im now starting to cut off all my friendships.\n\nContext: I have Aspergers, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, and an autoimmune condition that gives me mood swings and arthritis. I've dealt with the first 5 starting at 5-7 years old, and found out about the autoimmune condition at 12yrs old. I dealt with suicidal ideation and attempts from 5-17 years old. I got amnesia at 21 from my autoimmune condition and it gave me depression that got better. I've now started ADHD meds and I'm realizing how fucked up things have been and how I'll never be \"normal\", lost my ability to mask my autism with ADHD, and I feel fucking hopeless. \n--------------\nI've always tried to fit in with the rest of the people, but its not possible anymore. I've hated myself for being unable to fit in and how I was fucking horrible to deal with growing up due to constant mental health problems. I started taking ADHD meds and doing therapy again and I realized so many problems I have with myself.\n\nI have extreme self-loathing, it actually sucks to be in constant pain from arthritis, I'm now unable to be social with anyone from lack of ADHD as a mask, I'm scared of being close with people, I can't relate to anyone when it comes to having romantic and sexual feelings, I don't want to have others think I'm depressed, I won't fit into societies norm, trauma, and I can never be grateful for my accomplishments.\n\nI've realized that I'm scared of being close because of how I've neglected my family in the past from my depression and bipolar, and I don't want to do it again. I get nervous around police from how many times they took me to a mental health facility. I know I'd never take my mental health out on others again, but I can't shake the feeling that I will.\n\nI don't want anyone to not think I'm this happy person they all know. People view me as a good, kind, funny person who goes out of his way for others. I cannot relate at all to that when it just seems normal to do and I don't view myself as a good person despite knowing they're correct.\n\nI always struggled ro make friendships and mostly relied on my identical twin to make them for me. The first friends I really made by myself was after going to university after transferring from community college. I was young at 19 when I transfered and started taking graduate courses at 20 years old. \n\nAfter offically starting grad school I was super social with people and people liked talking to me. I got amnesia, extreme fatigue, and really bad depression during my first and had to take a leave of absense for the year after refusing to get medical help for 1.5 quarters. I've come back, but have no desire to really meet anyone anymore. \n\nI've tried talking to new people since august and I just can't. My depression's returned and same with my anxiety. I went to a friendsgiving event and left after an hour because of my depression and anxiety. I've been friends with them for 3 years and they helped me during my amnesia and previous depressive episode. Its been more common for me to be sad and uncomfortable ar social events despite them usually making me the happiest I can ever be. People were thrown off when I left abruptly, and wanted me to come back with my laptop since I said I had schoolwork to do. I didn't come back. I've since deleted all my social media's on all my devices (minus desktop) except for school ones without saying anything. No one has messaged me.\n\nI realized that I coped with my chronic loneliness by being around people which is unhealthy so I needed to isolate myself. I know that sounds irrational, but it just works for me. No one's messaged me aftee I opened my social media on my desktop. I realized most text conversations I start with my closest friends despite some of them not being social over text. Why even bother messaging people if they don't message me? Why bother being friends at all? \n\nI've also realized I'll never be happy with myself. I managed to graduate in 11th grade, was successful ar competitive swimming, made friends by myself for the firsr time, got a 3.5GPA in undergrad, started graduate courses at 20, work for the city as a paid intern, did a bunch of important student org stuff..... but I've never been happy nor satisifed with myself for these. I wasnt happy graduating high school nor undergrad. I only said those accomplishments since they should be happy moments, but not really to me. None of them felt like a major achievement. \n\nI've also realized that I've never had romantic feelings towards anyone and the girl I thought I did have some was just a girl who was nearly identical to me in personality/social stuff. It was just nice to not feel alone. I don't have those feelings anymore towards them, but they are someone I care about due to how similar we are.\n\nI keep getting pressured into trying to date people and I have zero interest in it. People are surpised I'm single because of how kind, compassionate, and funny I am. I think it might be a mixture of aromanticism and trauma. I'm curious about experiencing romantic feelings, but don't desire it. I'm nervous I'd rely on them for fixing loneliness. I've been on a few dates and have tried dating apps with some success? They never go past the 1st one because I feel bad for leading them on and end it. I've also had people get unhappy with me for turning down people who are super pretty by beauty standards. I don't like people flirting with me or trying to get to know me beyond surface level/platonic level. \n\nI've also never experienced sexual attraction towards anyone, but have a preference for women when I fantisize about being in a relationship. \n\nIt also hurts not feeling the same as my identical twin when it comes to having romantic and sexual feelings towards people, being happy with their achievements, and overcoming depression. They had similar issues growing up as me, but not as long. \n\nI just feel lonely, depressed, anxious, and hate myself. I recognize I have self-sabotaging habits that are irrational, but I just want to be happy inside and have the cycle of depression and mental health end. It feels awful realizing I'll never be normal. It feels awful not experiencing the same social emotions I used to, and cutting off everyone abruptly. I just go home some days after getting my stuff done and take a bunch of sleep meds and anti-anxiety meds so I can space out and feel at peace. Why won't it end? How do I accept myself?\n\n\n",

I tried weed, but when smoking alone I feel even worse. I used to play online games to escape reality but now every time I play anything I get bored in minutes.\n\nI never had an easy life, but I feel like I don't even deserve to say it, because my parents and siblings had it worse.\n\nI am 18 and still in school. I had and still do have really good grades, but never felt smart, and recently I feel so burned out and so stupid. I might have a bright academic future, but I don't feel like it's worth it.\n\nI recently opened up to a girl I barely knew because I felt like she was the only one understanding me, because of what she went through, but now I feel like it was too quick, and she lost all interest in talking to me. I told her things I have never told anyone else, and feel so dumb and pathetic for doing so. It was my first time opening so much to anyone.\n\nI feel like all my friends except for maybe one talk with me just because we are in the same class. Every time I reach out to do something, I feel like I am just annoying them while they have better things to do. My ex best friend, with whom I spent like 6 days a week for at least a year, started taking pills and became different and extremely aggressive. He stopped since, but I feel like I can't keep normal conversation with him anymore.\n\nI thought about suicide a lot, but I have never been in planning stage. Only thing I do is getting tattoos as form of SH. I get tattoos every time I have a bad period, and always get such a boost from it, but not this time.\n\nI got so much worse in a span of a month, and I don't know what is wrong with me.",

        "Text": "This started out as a comment on another post, but it got me thinking and the stuff I wanted to say wouldn’t have been relevant to the original post so I’m making my own I guess. \n\nI’ve been feeling a little more down than usual lately, especially when I’m by myself which is most of the time. It occurred to me that most people don’t feel like this. Most people don’t have to put effort into hiding how much they wish they didn’t exist. I just can’t understand what that’s like? I mean… everything I do is sort of distorted by the thought that things would be better without me. If I play a game with my friends, after I log off an insane loneliness sets in and I feel like they would all have a better time if I wasn’t there. If I get a hug from my mom, or she says that she’s proud of me, it feels like a lie. It feels like I’ve done nothing to deserve that and I almost wish she wouldn’t say it because then I feel guilty, as if I’ve tricked her into caring about me. \n\nAbout a year ago I dropped out of college because my mental health was declining to the point I was spending all of my time crying in the parking lot instead of going to class. That’s important because a couple weeks ago, my grandfather took me out to lunch. He talked about how lucky I was to get to go to college, how he wished he could have gone when he was young. He said he was impressed and proud of the degree I was supposed to be working towards. And I lied to him because I couldn’t bear to disappoint him. I told him school was going well, that my classes were all really interesting, that I was excited to get a job working in that field. I hate myself for doing that. Eventually he’s going to learn what’s been going on in my life and it’s going to hurt him. It’s going to hurt that he’s wasted so much time being proud of me when there isn’t anything to be proud of. If I didn’t feel so fucking empty all the time I wouldn’t have to lie. I could manage to get decent grades like I did when I was a kid. I just don’t understand why I feel this way. I have everything I need to be successful in life, but I’m falling apart and I feel like I can’t do anything about it. I’ll never be the person that my family wants me to be and I don’t know how to handle that.\n\nIf I didn’t have to deal with my mood constantly swinging from overjoyed to absolutely miserable I could at least focus on college classes. With that being said, I also know that it’s my fault for not being able to get past this. It’s my fault that I’m wasting away in my room instead of working towards a better future. I know other people who have dealt with depression that were still able to do something with themselves but I can’t manage to do anything at all. I would do almost anything just to experience for a day what it’s like to not have depression. To not be afraid of the future. To not completely shut down from the pressure from my family. I want to know what it’s like to feel genuinely ok, like my life isn’t one step away from completely unraveling.\n\nI kinda forgot my initial point with this but whatever. Thanks to anyone who skims through this mess lol",

I was so excited(a new feeling) about returning to college from going home and getting back to being my age and having fun. \n\nNow, i committed to a lot of things I now can’t fulfill. I felt better and told a lot of my friends about what I had gone through and that I’m now “healed”, and told people my commitment to now bulking since I have the motivation to do so, and promised my friends back at college I’d be back next weekend forever from now on doing things with them\n\nWell now I woke up yesterday and today and I am just as depressed and emotionless as I was before those 2 days. I now have to confess to my friends I’m depressed again, fail them by failing to stick to my commitment of bulking, and avoid them for another weekend once again by going home… \n\nI wanna get angry or sad and say fuck this disease but I can’t even do that, It’s like I don’t even exist. I have the depression that is completely no emotions, sad or angry or jealous or anything. Sometimes I wish I had the one where you can at least cry a lot about these things",

        "Text": "I don’t think I am able to keep going like this anymore. It’s been 15 years since I lost all of my will to live. I spent 9 years looking for something that makes me want to live for another day. 6 years ago on one fateful night i gave drugs a try. It finally made me enjoy doing something in this life. It made me look forward to another day. It was reading. Mostly manhwa, but books as well. But the price was too big. It nearly took everything, nearly lost it all in half a year. So there I was, on a fork with only 3 ways to continue. 1) Living a sober life even worse then before, because now I knew how it felt to enjoy looking forward to another day, and I knew I will not feel it again. Wishing to die every day. 2)get things somehow under control, and feel enjoyment for one of the biggest prices one could pay 3) finally end it all. \nAs you could probably guess, I went with route n.2. It worked for a while. But then the price changed. Instead of losing everything, I had to live with the consequences. Not only consequences of what it made me do in the past, but with “side-effects”. I was basically living in psychosis ever since. And I still am. I know it’s not real, but I can see it. I can feel it. And in the back of my mind I can hear myself thinking “what if it’s not just an imagination? It would be better to simply die”. Even taking a year long break didn’t help. Being sober only made me not feel enjoyment from reading anymore. The psychosis stayed.\n\nAfter 4 years of torturing myself I finally figured out how to control it, but instead things got worse. Way worse. So here I am again. Fork with three paths again. 1) sober life without a will to live, knowing I will never feel enjoyment again, wishing to die every single day, praying not to wake up each night. Brain damaged beyond repair. Along with living in delusion for the rest of my life with small hallucinations that target my PTSD, having complete emotional break-downs randomly 2) keep going the worst path possible and risk going insane. Don’t get me wrong, my mentality is strong enough to withstand a psychosis multiple years long, but it got worse 2 days ago. I started hearing the voice. 3) finally end it all. \nRoute n2 will inevitably end up connected to route n3. And what kind of life would it be if I took route n1 now? That can’t be called a life anymore, it will be better to just end it all. I tried for too long and the only thing that ever helped made it way worse. \n\nI think I may have actually tried to end it one time when I OD-ed, I’m not sure, I don’t remember much but I have a weird scar where my heart is ever since that day. However I do remember something similar to a DMT trip one gets when dying. The memory of it kept me from doing it again till now. In a weird state, not wanting to live, not wanting to die, just in case it wasn’t the release of DMT but real. I am by no means spiritual nor religious. I don’t believe that god exists. Even if some entity like that did exist, hell wouldn’t be real. But what I remember felt too real. \n\nBut now I think it would be better to go through that literal hell again. Even if I will never wake up from it. At least, it will be a different kind of hell than this life. I gave up on this one. I tried, I gave it my best. I really did. But 15 years is 15 years and it only got worse the more I tried. I am currently 28, so i have spent more than half of my life trying to no avail. ",

        "Text": "Hi all..not sure where to begin. I’ve historically been an open-minded, optimistic person when it comes to these things but lately (as in the past year or so) I’ve felt like my life has been spiraling out of control.\n\nSome background about me (25F) and my family: I was a straight A student in high school, the valedictorian, and am the only successful person in my family starting out virtually with nothing. Grew up in a small impoverished town, with a sibling who had medical issues that bankrupted my parents and most likely resulted in their divorce when I was 12. I endured years of emotional abuse from being “caught in the middle” of my parents arguing, my bipolar, antagonistic mom gaslighting me and father bullying me into spying on her (even bribing me with money to do it, but I really didn’t have a choice because if I said no he wouldn’t talk to me or give me my allowance), and one night my mother and father got into a drunken argument where my father nearly shot my mother and wrecked his car, to name a few traumatic experiences.\n\nI’m in the military and have came a long way and achieved a lot of great things, my career is progressing fine and I’m good with saving money and living with a roof over my head, so I can’t complain there.\n\nBut my private life is horrendously stunted, I get imposter syndrome at work really bad when coworkers ask what I did over the weekend or about my social circle, which is also nearly non existent. I have found myself spending time mindlessly watching YouTube brain rot, crying, maladaptive daydreaming, and/or quite literally staring at the wall. My social skills are underdeveloped because of my childhood, and I only had one friend in high school. This past year and a half, I have developed crippling back pain, my one friend from high school had moved in with me but didn’t pay bills, didn’t have a car or job, and ended up dating my crush I introduced her to (who she is now married to and has seemingly been taunting me with ultrasound photos of her new pregnancy), my father nearly died in a car wreck and after recovering he keeps saying he is going to die soon (I felt conflicting emotions due to the childhood stuff), my sibling with the medical issues barely graduated high school and has been in and out of jail and mental hospitals, each time I go on leave to visit there’s no food at home and I get used as an emotional punching bag, my one true military friend moved away, I had a horrible assignment where my boss and supervisor would constantly gaslight and bully me, I’m going to school for engineering but failed a class for the first time in my life, and my previous hobbies I enjoyed no longer feel fulfilling. I’ve moved to a new assignment but I worry I’m not good enough and am going to fail at that too. I’ve met a few guys over this period who I adored a lot but each time I end up misreading the signs and I get burned.\n\nI’m feeling disillusioned in life and I’ve came all this way but it seems like it’s all for nothing because I have no one to share it with and these experiences have made me bitter. My academic talent has been the main driver for college but I’m not too sure I will enjoy a career in the real world as an engineer. I’m single and live alone. If anybody has any advice or life stories similar to this situation I would be open to your thoughts on this. Thank you.",

I finally landed a job at a good company for a career I wanted to pursue for awhile but they send me to a training class which I failed after making it all the way to the end and the company revoked the offer, so now I've been back at my apartment for the past couple of weeks alone and unsure, at first it wasn't so bad because I got to see the girl I'd been seeing after being away for the class but she broke up with me last week out of nowhere so it kinda just feels like everything is falling apart. I've also lost most of my online friends; no real particular reason just friendships fading cause of life and them eventually unadding me or ghosting me. I only really have one irl friend he's been my best friend since high school but he has two kids and drives trucks for a oil and gas company so I almost never see him anymore. Just feels like every day just blends into the next, I wouldn't say I'm suicidal or anything I haven't been in a few years but things just never go well anymore and it's just exhausting.",

I believe that life will not bring me more pleasure. I would like to end my life, but only one thing leaves me - my parents\nI have read a lot of posts from people who also have problems with society and with the desire to live, but my situation is different from them, I didn't grow up in a bad family, I didn't fail all my life and the like, I just always wanted to be meaningful to this world, to carry kindness and positivity. The society of people does not understand me, they only need a favour. They want to get you and use it.\nEvery day I have more and more desire to commit suicide, I don't see the point of living. Life is just a time you have to live, but I'm too weak. I don't want to see people every day who disgust me, but unfortunately my finances don't allow me to take and go away from this world. I just want tranquillity and solitude. I guess I'm too horrible a person to communicate with people. I was often told that I am a heartless egoist who thinks only about himself, but I only heard it from those people with whom I was always as honest and open as possible, those people who told me this, were always close to me, I trusted them with the most important things in my life, but in the end it turned out that they were just using me.\n\nThree years ago, my girlfriend died. It was my fault. I was very angry after another breakdown, and told her all sorts of stupid things, for which I later paid... After our conversation, my girlfriend was very upset about me, although she knew that I often have strong mood swings, and that I could get it out on other people, but unfortunately it wasn't the first time, and she decided to act. After two days when we didn't talk, I decided to call her and come to talk to her and apologise to her. She didn't pick up the phone. I've been trying to reach her for 2 days, but it was all useless. On the 3rd day, her mother picked up the phone, and I heard her trembling and frightened voice saying to me \"She's dead\". I was broken. I immediately went to her house, but when I went up to her floor, I saw only her mother, and how she was taken out of the house in a bag. My tears had no limit, I felt like the most terrible person in the world. I saw her mother sitting near the threshold, and almost suffocating in her own tears. I hated myself. I thought my weakness for aggression would kill me, not my girlfriend. A couple of days later there was a search of the apartment, where a sheet was found in the bathtub, with a letter addressed to me. This letter was delivered to me, and although it's been 3 years, I remember it by heart \"(my name), I always wanted you to be happy, it was the only thing I wanted. I've seen you get worse and worse every day, but unfortunately you were afraid to tell me about it, because you thought I'd leave you because of it, lately I noticed how often you started to lose your mood because of me, and the only thing I had to do was to leave this world to make it easier for you, I hope in the future you will have your own family, beautiful children and a dog (the one we wanted to have with you) call him Richard. (my name) all the best to you. I believe you will achieve everything, you are very strong. but unfortunately I could not stand it. Know that I will always be with you.\n\nAfter that moment, I didn't leave the house for 5 months, I was rotting in the hope of dying of boredom to come back to her again. Without her, my life was meaningless.\n\nThat's all for me, I'll be very grateful if you read it. I apologise for deciding to express it to you, but maybe someone will be interested. It will be interesting to read what other users will answer to it",

Too broke to pay for internet to have a second of relaxation and make songs. Everybody i met through music has given up on me. My parents are losing their minds and I have to be the big person and make sure nobody loses their shit. I give up. I miss my friends. ",

We are renting out two houses, she lives in her own apartment and I also live in an apartment that's owned by her. I give her most of my income (only $80k worth) to invest in real estate and I also max out both our IRAs(about $30k worth), so most of of the money to buy houses are from her.\n\nFor years I been telling her that I will be ok financially when she passes even though she's pretty set on inheriting everything to me instead of spending it.\n\nHer parents were poor and they passed shortly after I was born and she had no one else to rely on. Growing up, we were mostly homeless but was able to make it out alive with very little resources. She had a tough life and had to work her way up from nothing and I just want her to use all the money she worked for to travel and live a financially stress free life since we don't have to worry about survival as much now. But understanding from a mother's perspective, her endless worries is justified.\n\nHowever it just doesn't sit right with me that she had to go through all that and work so hard so I can end up with a comfortable lifestyle later on which I don't feel like I deserve or earned. I really try to make her proud by being the best version of myself but it's hard and I'm still trying everyday to improve myself. At the moment, I don't like my job, no dating prospects, addicted to procrastination and screen time and other issues, I feel guilty that I could've done more. Like why can't I become a millionaire so she can retire ASAP? why can't I perfect my physique and make the best of what she gave me? why can't I do more of this or do that?\n\nSometimes I lash out at her to put more money in stocks rather than real estate because I felt impatient, frustrated that she's hasn't retired yet but in reality I'm just angry at my self for not making enough money. I know that's wrong and afterwards I would feel disappointed in myself. I often spend my nights crying in the rent free apartment I'm living in because I don't think I deserve this comfort which she has put me in. I worry that my depression will really kick in once she's gone and all I'm left with are these houses that are \"mine\".\n\nI know this is a lot but for now my temporary solution is to figure out a way for her to spend most of the money before she passes",

I was open about this to some of my family and friends, and was met with much needed support. Since then, I thought I've been getting better, but everything feels as if its crashing down again.\n\nI've been rethinking some things, like what I want as a career.\n\nI got a new job and I had my first day a few days ago at a café, in a really big estate place. The pay's decent and there's benefits to the job. Although everyone was nice enough and it was work I knew i'd eventually get the hang of, I couldn't help but feel I was so out of place. As the night got busier and busier, it made me realise I don't particularly want to do work like that for most of my working life. On top of that, I study Culinary arts at college, and i realised that I don't think that's the best path for me, even if i do enjoy cooking. Overthinking what else I could possibly do for a career is making me lose sleep some nights. Some days it feels easier if i was to just die already.\n\nI've been dealing the financial stress my family feels too, and the emotional stress and abuse from personal situations. All i want to do is either sleep or stay home all day. I can't bare to face most things anymore and i get super anxious when it comes to leaving the house for college or work. \n\nOn top of that, i feel lonely even when i'm not. I have friends, even if i might not see them as much as i'd like, but sometimes it feels as if i don't. Its very overbearing.\n\nIts gotten to the point where if i'm met with something that I find needs even a slight bit more effort than i think i can give, my first thought is that i should just kill myself. Some days it feels like i NEED to kill myself. \n\nEven though i think i want to, i can't - i have my parents to think about and other family that i need to look out for. It makes this 1000x harder than it needs to be, and sometimes i wish I had nothing left just to make it an easier decision. \n\n",

I’m completely devastated. I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. \n\nEverything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.\n\nI started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that. I know many people came through this eventually but man, I cannot do this. The pain is unbearable. I lost everything I really cared for in my whole life. A couple days after she left I found her profile on my PC and checked it. She’s already meeting other guys for sex. I don’t understand this. It’s too much for me to take. I have my fiends and parents with me, but I feel completely utterly alone.\n\nI thought to end it all over but I’m too afraid to fail and to live with the consequences.

As happy as one could be in a family with parents who always faught—verbally and physically. But that can only last for so long. By the time the bullshit exclusion and the cliques started at school, all that happiness was depleted. I started self harming at 11 fucking years old. One of my ONLY two friends told the whole school about my self harm. The other one reported me to the counselor. \n\nSince then, i’ve been hit by my mom, talked about like I was literal trash by my own father (and mother at some points), been bullied, ostracized, insulted, excluded. \n\nI tried to pull myself together to become a doctor, my next best goal for a profession when my initial dream was shat on and prohibited by my parents since age 11. I studied my goddamn ass off. I spent hundreds of nights miserable, anxious, worrying, sucking up to teachers who couldn’t give a shit about me, getting mistreated and insulted by egotistical doctors. It broke me into a million pieces. Eventually, I said fuck it. This isn’t worth my mental health. Not by a long shot. So I quit. \n\nI quit and began living life. Began having time for TV, and family gatherings, and non-stressful afternoons with my wonderful boyfriend. Getting this or that requirement didn’t matter anymore. Being better than and comparing myself to brilliant students didn’t matter anymore. I had the time to follow my initial career dream. \n\nBut you know what’s funny? I’m still fucking depressed. I’m still depressed after all of that. I have a wonderful boyfriend, soon to be husband, I have no more responsibilities now that i’m just riding out these last couple of classes I have before the semester’s over and I can officially kiss healthcare goodbye, my mom has changed over the years, she’s not perfect by any means, but somewhat better, same goes for my dad, BUT I’M STILL FUCKING DEPRESSED. I STILL FUCKING HAVE A DARK CLOUD, MOOD, SOMETHING OVER ME THAT DOESNT LET ME BE. \n\nI JUST wanna go. I just wanna stop stringing along my recovering, happy boyfriend who’s antidepressants ACTUALLY work and didn’t fuck him over like all mine did, and my family who for my 24 years of life struggled to understand what depression even was and still gets pissed every time they see me sad, and FINALLY FUCKING GO. SEAL THE DEAL, MAKE A MOVE, END IT. \n\nI’M DONE. FUCK ALL OF THIS. I obviously can’t fucking feel what the normal human feels anymore. It’s been a battle since I was 9 years old. I’m tired.\n\nI apologize to all those who thought, either because of their own sake or from an authentic, sympathetic standpoint, that I’d get better. Medicine failed me, medical marijuana failed me, therapy failed me, it all fucking failed me. \n\nGoodbye. And to a particular few, fuck you.\n\n",

Don't think any of that is happening any time soon, though. It sucks.",

I want to feel good or at least normal, not like shit. Im coping every day that everything is good but it isnt. Im putting mask of a strong boy in front of my family but Im broke inside.\n\nBenzos were good but I stopped taking them, I was too afraid about addiction. I use pregabalin which is great for anxiety but it doesnt set me in good mood like benzos, more like getting even more depressed.\n\nI just want to say it to somebody, peace",

Which means i havent showered in that much time and my curly hair is extremely matted. I want to come out of this and \"fix\" myself but i don't know how. I don't have anyone to help me I'm living away from my family and my roommate/best friend has her own problems and i can't expect her to drop everything to help me. I've been depressed since a very young age so i know how to hide things and most people don't have the slightest cue as to how bad i am doing. I have almost missed so many of my midterms this past week bc i simply couldn't make myself get out of my bed or move. I feel like shit. I keep trying to make friends but i am always failing bc even when all the circumstances are right, which is rare by itself, i struggle with putting in the effort to keep the friendship going bc i am barely functioning at most times. I don't understand. I've been in therapy for over 7 years, been on antidepressants and sleep medicine (mood stabilizers given to me for improving my atrocious sleep) for about 3 years. Nothing seems to be improving. In fact i feel like i am getting worse as time goes on. I can not and will not commit suicide because i have made promises to my mother and my younger brother, but i seriously don't see a reason to keep going on. Those promises are the only things holding me back because while i still have some hope i genuinely struggle to believe i am even capable of healing at any time. Most of the time it feels like even if i don't kill myself some sort of accident will take me out before long and i am just killing time until then. But like what's the point? I'm just a waste of time, money, and resources. I don't know how to get better",

Anyways\n\nI feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way while on the other hand it makes total sense that I do. And that confuses me.\n\nReasons why I feel like I shouldn't feel this way:  \n\\- Finished school  \n\\- Got a job and I genuinly like working there (if the depression doesn't keep me from feeling anything at all)  \n\\- I'm financially more than stable  \n\\- I have a car  \n\\- I have people that like me and care about me  \n\\- Got through many hardships in life but I'm still standing\n\n  \nReasons why I think I still hate everything about my life:  \n\\- My father died when I was 10  \n\\- My mother was an alcoholic and made my teenage years a living hell (yelling, beating, lying and faking a good life in front of teachers and companies designed to help us  \n\\- she died when I was 20  \n\\- I live with my grandparents at the moment because they can't live for themselves and my grampa suffers from dementia  \n\\- I either work, support my grandparents or I call in sick and lie in my bed for hours on end  \n\\- I never had a girlfriend, a kiss, sex or whatever  \n\\- I tried in school, at work, on dating apps throughout my life but never even had a date.  \n\\- My grandma doesn't really understand mental health issues  \n\\- My uncle who wass like a father to me died 5 months ago after his 3rd stroke. I spent half a year being his legal guardian before he passed  \n\\- The friends I do have tell me that I simply reject every form of help  \n\\- I started medication 6 months ago and sso far it didn't do jack shit.   \n\\- I don't have any hobbies outside of gaming (mostly singleplayer stuff on my own) and everytime someone tells me I need to find one I fee like \"Yeah maybe, but there is simply nothing I care about\".  \n\\- I'm not really fit but exercising jut bores me. I tried multiple things (running, walking, swimming, bike riding, gym)\n\n  \nMy life is fully functional. I'm a white heterosexual guy in germany. I am privileged beyond belief honestly. But I can't even remember when I felt genuinely happy. I'm trying for therapy next but at this point it feels like there is no point anyways. And then I beat myself up for that mindset because I know that will result in a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nI'm just tired... I just want to be happy. I just want to not feel alone.

But the feeling of getting back into a depressive period (for me it's more like days, sometimes weeks) makes me super anxious, because I become so depressed that I become suicical, I get dissociation and it's the worst feeling ever. In those moments, of course I don't have any hope and it's almost too painful (also physical pain) to live with. \n\nBut since I've started therapy, after about a month or so, I have got some insights that give me a tiny bit of hope for the future. Only, I know it will be a slow process. My therapy is very intensive and it will last until the end of next year. But even after therapy I'm sure I won't have the life that I would want yet, only hopefully I'll be closer. \n\nRight now I'm super unhappy with myself and with my life and I know that my circumstances or my self image won't radically change within a few months. But I'm afraid that if the process is too slow, I'll at some point lose hope again and spiral back into those very depressive periods.\n\nSo yeah.. I'd like to hear stories about how other people went trough this. And if you did feel depressed again despite making progress, how did you still continue? Etc..\n\nThank you.\n",

I didn’t realize it at the time so I think it was operating on a subconscious level (kinda self-sabotage) I thought I was a burden so I might have acted this way so if I commit suicide he would not be saddened by my death and hate me instead.

        "Text": "I've been experiencing some severe depression and anxiety. I was a lot better at the start while on 75mg venlafaxine and 2mg risperidone. I reacted very negatively, with symptoms of increased depression, anxiety, aggression and OCD to my psychiatrist increasing my venlafaxine from 75mg to 150mg. During this time I also opened up 150mg capsules to consume partial capsules which made the situation worse, like A LOT worse. During the days I consumed partial capsules I was experiencing such debilitating anxiety and depression that I pretty much just rolled around on the floor all day. After unsuccesfully contacting my psychiatrist for 6 weeks, I finally went to the ER and they titrated me down to 75mg venlafaxine. However, I did not return to the way I was before my psychiatrist increased my venlafaxine from 75mg to 150mg. After having been on 75mg venlafaxine for about 3 months with severe depression and OCD symptoms, I'm stopping both my venlafaxine and my risperidone to conceive. These 3 months have been very grueling and I have at least 2 months to go before I can conceive. Can anyone please recommend a way to ease depression and anxiety symptoms? Would taking creatine help?\n\nI'm at the end of my rope and feeling borderline suicidal after the medication adjustments. The medical system has not been much help. I don't see another psychiatrist until the new year but I'm feeling very helpless. My symptoms are so severe that I don't know what to do. I would appreciate any advice on this.",

She feels like that's such a weird example to choose for such a context. Why??\n\nAlso yesterday they were talking about EMDR and how strong it could be for people with traumatic. Out of nowhere he mentioned a rape victim of his (female) to, again, illustrate his point even though she actually had the same traumatic past. She felt like he talked about it so casually that it doesn't matter that much to him and even just the fact that he forgot that she could be touched by such a mention.\n\nPlus now she's adding up a lot of small innocuous examples of how he used to be really familiar, confiding about his life, being vulgar in language.\n\nWhat do you think ? Is it normal at all ?",

I love them, but they make me feel worthless, like a failure, they are the only thing that makes me depressed, and it's to the point to which I don't know if I can stand It any longer. I'm heavily insecure about almost everything about me, and I know no one will see this but people said that talking about it would make me feel better, but I don't know anymore. My mother and father won't listen to a thing I say when they get mad, I love them, but I can't stand it anymore. I can't talk to anyone I know because I know it will come back to my family, and if it did I don't know what I would do.",

I took a walk to calm down and that's when I made a mistake.\n\nI got high during this walk and went to the nearby train station to sit down for a while\n\nBefore I left I was having very bad thoughts. Thinking about how much easier things would be if I was just dead\n\nAn express Amtrak train was coming through the station. I didn't know it was an express train so I stood relatively close to the track (on the platform) so I could experience the train going by\n\nThe train that actually came, came by fast. It rumbled the ground, was loud. It honestly scared me as it flew past, the suction from the last few cars even moved me around slightly \n\nAfter this, I went to Wendy's and there I think I was able to uncover the real reason I feel the way I do. I have no direction in life. I feel like a failure already in my early 20s. I just dont see a future in which I'm happy\n\nI'm sorry if this next part doesn't make sense\nI'm trying to remember how I felt last night, laying down. I was scared, I never felt such a terror at the thought of what could be happening to me.\n\nI felt like there's two different personalities in me and one of them is okay with dying and the other really isn't. And the one that really isn't okay with dying is being suppressed normally. But last night I think I felt it. The terror of knowing that there could be this thing inside me, alerting the way I think against my will. Making me think that suicide is the answer \n\nI'm not sure why I went to the station. I didn't have any intentions to do anything. But I wondered, \"what if I was feeling worse?\" If what I experienced isn't just from me being high, could whatever is making me think this way really win one day?\n\nI know this didn't really make sense but I'm having trouble finding the words to describe what happened..\n\nI just wanna ask, has any one you experienced something like this?",

We were friends for a year. I met him online. And since he was my only friend, i miss him now. I have sunk down into a depression stage about 5 months ago when we were still friends, and i used to talk to him alot earlier about it, i felt safe with him. It has become worse now that he isnt my best friend anymore. My heart stings every time i think of him, and i miss him alot.\n\nI just felt like i needed to vent. Someone might give me ideas on how to make myself think of him less.",

        "Text": "\nEver since we talked about how lonely I’ve been, I’ve felt really depressed, sad, and disconnected. I’ve also been having this strange desire to drink—not that I ever would—but just to numb my feelings so I don’t feel anything. I just want to feel happy, at least enough for people to tolerate me or put up with me. I try so hard to be a tolerable person at the very least because I don’t expect anyone to truly like me. Why would they? I’m a depressed, sad person who doesn’t bring anything to the table because I’m depressed so often.\n\nI keep asking myself: how do I keep having boyfriends or people liking me? Aren’t my friends tired of me because of how depressed I am? Why would anyone want to be around me? I feel so empty, like I don’t offer much. I sit alone, I’m quiet, I’m disabled, and I can’t do much. The same goes for my boyfriend—why would he like me? I’m trying so hard to make him happy, even if I’m not, because the most important thing is that he’s happy.\n\nYesterday, I went to a birthday party. I cried in the bathroom for a few minutes because I felt so sad and alone. I know there were people around me, but I still felt alone. It wasn’t even my party, but I cried in there, thinking, I feel so alone. I feel like no one loves me or even likes me. Why would they? I sat in the kitchen alone for a bit, and my friend asked why I was sitting there. I told her it was so I wouldn’t be in the way, so people could pass by. She said, “Oh, please come sit with us,” but I knew she didn’t really want me there. She didn’t want my presence.\n\nLater, I was throwing away plates and picking up cards, trying to avoid interacting. My friend said, “Oh, thank you for cleaning. I should invite you to my house more often.” I smiled and said, “Yeah, sure,” but inside, I thought, Why would she want me there? She should hate me as much as I hate myself. I really do hate myself—so much—because of how depressed I am, because I’m disabled, because I don’t even believe my presence is worth the hassle.\n\nI barely talked at the party. I know I could never say these things out loud. When I got home, I cried again. I was in so much pain. I still feel like crying, but I can’t. Not with my mom possibly walking in, asking a hundred questions, pretending she cares. I feel like my friends should just put me away in a closet until they need me or want me.\n\nI don’t know why my friend invited me, or why my boyfriend likes me. I feel so worthless, depressed, stupid, and lazy. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere or that I matter at all. I just want to make everyone happy. My friend got her a bunch of gifts, and I’m sitting here thinking, What kind of worthless piece of shit friend am I? I only got her three things. I should have gotten her everything on her list or something. I don’t know. I just want to make my presence useful to my friends, my boyfriend, and everyone else.\n\nI feel like I’m no better than the characters I play.",

My mom is overtly obsessed with my wellbeing and in turn it’s just weird, she already has bipolar so it just makes it worse. If I don’t do everything she says she’ll get mad and basically mentally abuse me, she thinks I need to see her and be around her for most of the day every single day and gets mad if we don’t have enough “time together”. I don’t want to be around her anymore, every time she leaves or goes to bed I’m so happy. My dad is fine alone but when they’re together they just constantly argue and he ends up just leaving me alone with her and walking out, which she seems to think is a good thing. I can’t take it anymore and I just don’t want to exist anymore.",

I don’t like to play victim and feel sad because I feel like if I would have just stayed home in the first place this wouldnt have happened. I know that obviously if a girl is in a bed with a guy he is going to want to have sex and keep pushing it so I cant be mad? I just feel like this has happened to me a bit and it really sucks. One time I also was taken to a secluded area at 4am with a guy who was older where I kept saying no but he kept begging and I was scared he was going to hurt me so I ended up just having sex with him so we could leave. That time was way worse but I still feel like these things are my fault because if I just wouldn’t have gone. I end up regretting it all though because then I get upset or rude after and then it makes me\nseem like the bad person and they probably don’t want to talk to me again whereas other girls, some of them want to have sex just because and are all for it so they seem more fun and upbeat. I do not like having sex unless the guy has shown interest in me and made effort to get to know me yet sometimes I end up in these situations. Am I tripping or is it sexual coercion? Is it my fault or what? ",

Some people tried to help me but there's nothing to do.\nI have a big trauma bc when i was 11 years old i was sexu@lly @ss@ulted by a member of my family. Almost nobody knows that, except some online ppl who tried to help. I hate myself for what happened. I was just a toy. I feel very bad. And I have been bullied for years at school, i don't have any friend. My school is a private school that is putting so much pressure, i don't even wanna study now. Younger, I almost lost my best friend bc of a tentative of su!cide. We don't really talk anymore now but at that time i was trying everything to help her, i did everything i could. She was so kind with me and i really care about her, i tried everything to help but it feels like it was not enough. She was the only one who protected me from the bullies. She left school 3 years ago. It has not gotten better. Im still bullied, even by the ppl who are 'my friends'. I have good grades and i skipped a year but i don't care anymore. The school just doesn't care about the mental health  of their students. Ive been in depression for years. Why is everyone so blind ? My parents say they love me, they say they care. Then they say i should have better grades and they say i do everything wrong. They always put my little brother first. Im glad they take care of him but inside it still hurts. They want to control me all the time so i have restrictions, i can't use my phone so much, i can't watch tv a lot, i can't complain, i can't talk to them bc it 'bothers them', i have to study, i have to be better, i have to be a perfect daughter. I always deceive them, no matter how hard i try, they always find something i do wrong. Im tired that ppl think i am an object, something they can use or play with.\nSo yeah i already tried to end this sh!tty life but at the last moment i stopped and idk.\nI tried to reach some help through internet. Some ppl tried to help. A girl in particular really tried, for 2 months, but i messed up everything and she left me. But i love her so much, she means the world to me. Ive kept living bc i hoped she would comeback one day and we could talk again. But yesterday another girl told me that, even if this girl feels bad bc she left me like that (saying i was a toxic friend and i was just a bad person and starting to say it was all my fault anyways), she also said that this girl feels relieved now, and that she says i just did that for attention and stuff like that. No, i just wanted someone to care about me, take care of me and PROTECT ME. is that too much ? I guess so. Nobody has ever really protected me. I am hurting by everything now. Im so tired.\nSo if i write this, it's bc you have to understand that there's nothing u can do, nothing anyone could do, there's no hope for me, and what i ask for is legitimate. Please someone tell me an easy way to end everything, quick. Please.\nLove u all, take care",

But, now I'm here feeling like I'm slowly falling down this giant dark pit again. \n\nI think the depression might be over for a few weeks only for it come back for months on end. Last time this happened I thought I was feeling like myself a little bit and that I'm going to have at least three months of a wonderful summer because school is finally over and I thought it was one big factor for my constant depression. Little did I know what existential crisis, active suicidal depression and low spirit were waiting for me stripping me away from peace of mind and leaving me with a troubled soul. It's a never-ending spiraling vicious cycle at this point. \n\nNow, my chest feels heavy with a heart loaded with hurt, a mind so loud with echoes coming from the empty void.\nBest time of the day is when I'm asleep in spite of some nightmares here and there.\nThose nightmares as scared as I wake up from them with my heart racing are nothing to be compared with the weary feeling of merely existing and surviving when I'm conscious.\nI love being unconscious. I love the feeling of not feeling. I love feeling like I'm in control of nothing and to just be a spectator of my own movie. \n\nThese depressive episodes are like sea waves. Big strong sea waves that I can see from far away coming for me to embrace the drown without any choice. My boat is too small to help me escape. I don't understand why those waves keep coming one after one. What's moving them? When are the waves that help move across the sea coming? \n\nAll I know is I'm surrounded by a lot of negativity that sucks the living soul out of me. Tell me not to get depressed if you were me. The daily negativity makes me yearn for the day I'm six feet deep under the ground. It makes me wanna pray for God to take my soul instead of helping me run away. \n\nToo much stress to deal with all alone at a very young age. No wonder I might have become more bitter and cynical for most people my age which makes it harder to connect feeling like an old soul. The truth is life's struggles seem manageable or at least lighter when shared with at least someone else. I kept and still keep things to myself to the point of feeling like I'm a walking grave, a grave in which so many things are buried inside. This grave is at the deep end of the sea. Can anybody be able to find it someday to simply discover it instead of taking it for granted? \n\nIt's scary to live without love. It's terrifying to know that no one has got my back if something terrible suddenly happens. No one to fall back on in times when the storm takes over. No shoulder to lean on. No hand to hold. I like to convince myself that I can do this by myself. It's not impossible and I don't mean that we don't need it. We need it but it's still possible to make it on our own. It feels sometimes like I'm trying to become some type of superhuman rebelling against nature.",

I just turned 25, and I feel like my age is becoming more serious, yet I haven't achieved anything remarkable. I've dropped out of three degree programs, gave myself one more chance, but now I'm struggling again. I think I've lost track of my classes, and once more, I feel overwhelmed by the fear of abandoning another program halfway through.\n\nI hate my job and where I live. It's nothing like what I envisioned for myself at this age when I was younger. Even worse, I see former classmates already having kids, families, starting businesses, or building careers, while I feel like I've accomplished nothing.\n\nI'm trying to stay focused, but I don't know how much longer I can handle feeling this way.",

There arent many tall places here i can jump off, most roofs are inaccessible, i have no guns or nothing alike, im too scared of pain to use a knife and i just want it to be easy.. so im wondering if there are any kinds of pills one can get without prescription that can help me.\n\nThanks.

She led me on for 2 extra months instead of breaking up with me before she went uni.\nShe told me that during October, I needed to change for her because she's losing feelings, so I ripped myself apart and put myself back together , I don't even feel like the same person. I've hurt myself to be what she wanted me to be.\nShe left me and replaced me when she didn't see the change quick enough, and because she couldn't see me as often as she liked.\nShe used to say she loved me and that she only had eyes for me. She said she only wanted a future with me.\nI hate myself for everything. She made it seem like it was me that caused everything to go to shit. I was hurting during our relationship, but I loved her, so I was okay with it.\nI miss her, and I know she isn't coming back, but I keep dreaming about her calling me again and telling me she loves me.\nI really only had eyes for her. I seriously did. Nobody else could make me change everything about myself for them. Nobody would have made me feel as hurt as I am now because she doesn't love me anymore. I'm suffering so much.\n\nI called her Friday, and that's when I found out she replaced me. She was so unbothered and didn't care about me anymore, I was just something keeping her company in her life. I was just there for her to rely on when nobody else was. Now that she found another guy to rely on for when she's upset, I guess there's no reason for me to be around? Right?\n\nI honestly want to die. I want to die so she can at least feel a little sad over me.\nPeople keep saying it's going to get better, but honestly, it doesn't feel like it. I just can't stop thinking about how they're getting closer each day. How long will it take until they do stuff? How long will it take for their first official date. \nI envy them so much. \nI was weak and pathetic to beg her to stay, but wouldn't you do the same when that's literally your world? Wouldn't you do the same when you've sacrificed so much for them? \n\nShe's evil for how she did things to me, leading me on, making me change everything about myself, making me feel like this, replacing me because times got a little difficult for us.\nShe lied to me. She said she loved me and always will. But because she couldn't physically see me for some months, she fell out of love.\n\nWhy nikol. Whyd you have to keep me for 2 extra months, why couldn't you have just left me Face to face, why couldn't you just tell me what's good about your new man, what did I do to deserve this, whyd you have to tell me you replaced me, whyd you make me change for you.\n\nI really loved you.\nI really did love you, and I hope you see nobody else would have done this for you, I hope you see nobody else would love you how much i did.\nI miss you, and I love you.\n\nWithout you, I want to die. My heart is actually hurting so much. I've been fighting suicidal tendencies for a while, and she delivered the final blow.\nI want to die so much because I want her to at least have some sympathy for me so she can feel something towards me.\n\nI love you so much, and you ruined me.\n",

I only break because I go to a special School for troubled kids who have a rough past... yet I don't have a bad past? maybe my parents only sent me there because they were worried that I was suicidal or something I'm not so sure anymore... the school I go to is uhm... oh gosh I can't say the name of this place, or the school will find me... gosh I wish I could say it but ill describe it. btw here is my age and gender (White, 15, Male)\n\nThis is a Boys only school containing only 24 students, the school was designed differently among other schools... it's a sports Acadamy but I call this place half a military school... the four subjects of this place are, Boxing, English, Swimming and math and that's all... no history no art no music none of that exists here in this place... we go to school in an old warehouse. and because this is Australia there should be uniforms right? no... they are so budgeted due to how small this place is there is no uniform here... like an American school you could say guess... the reason I break is because I'm treated bad because people here think I did something bad to be at that place but in reality I was just depressed and on the verge of suicide because I didn't like life so much.. I feel like a scared quiet and lonely little boy who wants his mommy sometimes... because we have boxing in that place, I get punched a lot... may I remind you these students have a naughty past such as theft or hijacking vehicles or beating people in their old schools, so they had no problem hitting and boxing people as if it was a real fight... I on the other hand am scared for people's safety... I hate hitting people and when I do. I hit softly, making sure I don't hurt them. I'm not the boxing type but if I refuse to do it... the teacher will hit me, yes, you heard that right the teachers are scary too... it's been here for 4 months, and I don't think I can do this anymore... I had just broken down 30 minutes before in my room on my bed on my back with the covers over me, my breathing was shallow, and I couldn't see anything... I felt like I was about to pass away any moment...\n\nwhy did my parents put me in this place? I would ever hurt anyone or steal something... I want to be normal in a normal school again... dating is out of the question because before school I'm happy but after it I feel empty and suicidal... I'm a soft person a gentle person... it's just the way I am someone fix me please",

I had been feeling extremely depressed and filled with pain that whole day from where or what exactly I couldn't tell. I have been living these last few months pretty much totally alone and I QUITE LITERALLY HAVE NOT 1 SOUL IN THIS WORLD TO TALK TO. I rode home to drop my pack off at home. Then (I'm not sure what I was thinking exactly) as I still listening to the music I walked back out to the driveway to pick up my bike I decided to go back out for another ride.\n\nI took that bike, now no longer burdened with the weight of my pack I took off down the those winding suburban streets like a bolt of raging fire! I must've raced down that mile and half going 25mph or faster; I never rode so fast in my life! I through the local park toward a busy two land rode that always had lots of traffic around that time of day and as I approached it I took absolutely no heed of the traffic or anything and raced across it at speed. There was no car near at hand on the left but on the right a car was coming and I was a nanosecond from hitting it. I don't know who/what decided it, but I instantly and automatically grabbed both brakes harder than ever before, causing the bike to tip onto the front tire and stop on a dime! (and somewhat damaged the brake). The car stopped and I continued across and made out it alright.\n\nThe strangest thing was how after that my mood shifted almost immediately from despair to an adrenaline fueled euphoria! I still feel bad when I think about what that act would've meant for the driver, though, and because of that amid a few other reasons I promised myself I would never do that again. But I came back here and posted because I been feeling real low again lately and there's still no one to talk to. I'd hoped that there would be some folks on here at least who would be good sport and good support to hear from, I guess.",

I was never the main character, I would never become someone of great importance. \n\nI just can’t do it for much longer. Advice floats in one ear and out the other. My career is down in the gutter.

I think I have ADHD which is severely impacting my motivation and spurring on my depressive state, but an unnamed fear is keeping me away from getting it checked. I feel so lazy, so useless. My efforts and optimism dwindles every single day with just unbridled stress. Money, lack of love, lack of friends. I’m only 27, I should be filled to the brim with excitement of the future but it only brings me terrors. My mind is racing with unhealthy thoughts and fear. It feels like for my entire life, since I was a child, I’ve had to be the adult. From being abused, to not progressing in my career as a tattoo artist(my once dream career), to being so desperate for money that I’d just rather die than deal with the stress it comes with. The loneliness and stress of just existing is becoming too much to handle. I can’t live up to the expectations put in place by peers, loved ones, strangers, the world.\n\nOn this quiet bus, my thoughts are telling me to just get off and disappear. Disappear so that no-one could find me. Jump off a building, overdose…I don’t know. I’m so scared and I’ve never felt this scared in my life.",

Now, I have spent 5 years in that addiction, I do it 5 times a day and the best cold turkey I did was 2 days.   \n  \nMy mental health is getting worse since I got into uni because what I explained above. Even p#rn became soul crushing because of the realization that Im doing nothing and Im not productive and that Im emotionally void. In first, when I was in an only-boys boarding high school, I didn't feel what I feel in uni because the school was miserable and we all suffered there.   \n  \nI went to a psychiatrist and told me that I'm suffering from depression and anxiety, which prevents me from studying and finishing my projects that contribute to my sense of fulfillment, self-worth, and achievement. I don't know what to do to heal using behavioral methods, and the psychiatrist suggested trying different anti-depressants (SSRI specifically). I objected at first because of the side effects of gaining weight, lower testosterone and feeling numb. But now the my mental problems are getting worse with every day passing and taking medications seems now like the only way to stop that mental torture, and start putting more effort and work into the academic and professional, practical stuff since working hard is providing me a direction and a sense of value. \n\nI just want to know if it is worth it to take medication for my issues or not to numb my emotional side to some extent so that I can keep studying and being productive?",

I've had depression and social anxiety for probably over a decade now and I've managed it with distractions like games (Which isn't really a healthy solution) and occasional therapy appointments.\n\nLife has been very stagnant for me where I feel like I'm trapped in my own apartment for eternity just repeating the same day over and over again. My average day begins with me waking up, playing games and thinking if my life is worth it and what my place in society is as I smoke a cigarette on my balcony watching cars drive on the road while sometimes wishing I could just swap places with one of the people driving them.\n\nI do try to have fun with friends and be productive like cleaning around my apartment and thinking \"Today I will change and quit smoking\", but my mental health feels like the more fun and productive I am, the more backlash (if that's the right word) I will have later with negative feelings. Even so I try to do and enjoy what I can.\n\nGoing outside with anxiety feels like walking against heavy wind causing the steps I take to require extra effort and energy while being unable to focus well around crowds. I know I shouldn't just seal myself in my apartment so I usually take a walk in the morning or evening and go grab a drink or a snack from a nearby store so I can at least get a little bit of exercise and fresh air.\n\nLately I've been keeping distance from friends and family as I fantasize about just not existing and how I wish I could just erase everyones memories of me so I wouldn't hurt them if I was gone, but currently I think the hurt I would cause others outweighs my own pain so I stick around, surviving one day at a time and trying to keep those thoughts in check.\n\nI will try to keep on going though and slowly improve my life, hopefully one of the job applications I sent works out so I would have some rhytm and stability in my life.\n\nIf you're also in a similar position as me then I hope this post will at least make you feel like you aren't suffering alone.",

        "Text": "I 17 yr old fm got drunk at work and embarrassed myself.\nI currently do online school and on my days off I go to work at my dad’s law firm and help out because I eventually want to become a lawyer one day.\nRecently I have been feeling more and more depressed as for the past four years I have not had any friends for the past four years.\nThe last I hung out with anyone besides my family was in my freshman year.\nHaving no friends or social life has really took a toll on me and I tried to ignore it and live on with my life all these years but I just couldn’t do it anymore. I constantly feel like a failure and I feel ashamed whenever my parents have to talk about me to their friends because I am no where near the level of other teens my age .\nSo what happened was I had a breaking point and got drunk at my dad’s law office. My dad was out of town last Friday so one of his employees drove me to work and that night I had drank some alcohol as it was the only thing that made me feel happy. The morning of I felt a little hungover so I thought a shot or two would help me but as it kicked in I felt like I couldn’t stop myself from drinking more and I ended having 6 shots of alcohol which were  , 2 shots of tequila, 2 shots of rum, and two shots of vodka. I still felt functional so I decided to go to work when the employee picked me up. During the car ride to work I started cussing a lot because I couldn’t control myself and I ended up dropping my phone beneath my seat and while I was searching for it I felt a bottle of something and it was sunscreen. I grabbed the sunscreen and started spraying it on the dashboard right in front of me as I couldn’t help myself. The employee took the sunscreen away from me and said I needed to chill. Eventually, we got to work and my job is to open all the mail that comes in and stamp it, then code it.\nSo, I clocked in at work and started stamping the mail but I was doing it pretty aggressively and loudly even though I thought no one could hear me. I started repeatedly saying the F-word while I was stamping the mail very loudly. \nPeople started to get concerned and the employee who took me to work told the lady who works in finance that I said I was drunk.\nThe finance lady then asked me what was going on and called my dad and put me on the phone. They both suggested that I go on a walk as I like walking occasionally. I went on a walk and walked around the galleria as it is right next to my dad’s office. I found myself at the top of a 6 story parking garage ready to jump off but I resisted the urges and I ended up just laying down as I felt so drunk at this point. About 20 minutes later a security guard came up to me and asked if i was ok and if he needed to call an ambulance. I said no and that I was fine so I walked down to the shopping area and just stumbled around in the different shops. At one point I was getting ready to go into the Dillards store so I followed these two ladies who I thought were customers and I didn’t realize they were employees so I walked into the break room which was this big narrow warehouse. They let me in because I was behind them and once i saw that they were clocking in on this computer I realized that I wasn’t supposed to be there. Luckily this lady approached me and asked if I was supposed to be there and I said no and that I didn’t know what I was doing. She said that she could tell and she let me out. I ended up walking around more and the security guard that approached me earlier drove right by me in his car and told me to come with him. We went to the security office which was located in the galleria and he had me sit down drink some water. He called this other security guard as he didn’t know exactly what to do. Eventually he said that since I was acting functional he could not legally hold me and that I was free to go. At this point everyone was worried about me and my phone was being blown up with calls and text messages from my family. I walked back to my dad’s office and he had just gotten back from the airport since he was on a business trip. He was freaked out but he was able to get an appointment with my physiatrist a few hours later as I really needed to talk to someone.\nI talked to her and I got put on a different antidepressant which is called rexulti.\nAlso, my parents had no idea that I was drinking alcohol so this became a really big deal.  I also ended up breaking my mug while I was drunk at work and apparently I also broke my monitor.\n\n\nI felt extremely embarrassed and ended up taking this week off from work. I have to go back Monday so I feel really nervous. I did end up apologizing to the employee for my behavior and offered to pay for a car cleaning as she mentioned that she was going to go get it cleaned because of the sunscreen.\n\nI still feel really depressed and suicidal but I will be starting a virtual outpatient therapy program if my insurance company approves.

I just don’t feel. it’s almost like I’m on autopilot I can’t quite put it into words but I just don’t care anymore. I hate complaining about this because I always have that thought of “life isn’t that bad, get over it. Others have it worse” but it’s just like overwhelming darkness is encroaching upon me and I can’t escape it. In a sense I’m scared but in the same sense, again; I’m not feeling anything. I was always told numbness is a symptom of too many emotions and you just shut down but genuinely it just feels like emotions are depleting rather than overloading. I just wonder if anyone’s felt this before (ofc someone has but idk sorry not thinking clearly atm) ",

        "Text": "This season of life has been heavy for me. I’ve made the heartbreaking decision to distance myself from family members I deeply love and care about. Their behavior around my wedding—an experience that should have been nothing but joyous—left scars I didn’t anticipate. While the day itself was perfect, filled with love and the incredible presence of my husband, the actions and attitudes of my family around that time cast shadows I’m still trying to move past. The hurt didn’t stop with the wedding—it lingered, making it hard to reconcile the joy of that day with the pain surrounding it.\n\nAdding to the emotional weight, my body betrayed me just before the wedding. A week before I was supposed to walk down the aisle, I found myself in the hospital. Double nephritis, sepsis, anemic, and a uterine polyp that required a D&C—I fought through all of it. Less than 24 hours after being discharged, I boarded a plane to our destination wedding, determined not to let illness steal the happiness I had been dreaming of. It was a whirlwind, but love (my husband) carried me through.\n\nNow, as life slows down, I find myself missing my family. When my husband is at work and the house grows quiet, my mind fills the silence with memories—good, bad, and everything in between. I feel joy reflecting on the happy times, but also sadness and anger as I replay the ways they let me down. The ache of missing them, even while knowing space is necessary, feels like a wound that hasn’t quite healed. One of the family members is my aunt, who is terminal with cancer. \n\nLife feels like it’s spinning with uncertainties. I’m hopeful for a future pregnancy, yet fear grips me. The thought of bringing a child into the world under the looming political landscape terrifies me. And then there’s the practical worry—what if the pregnancy is complicated? What if I lose my job? I carry most of our financial load, and the thought of losing our home is a weight I can’t shake. \n\nTonight, the noise became too much. I felt the need to escape, to just drive. I didn’t realize I had left my phone behind or that my inhaler had slipped from my pocket. My body is in the middle of a bad asthma flare-up, but I didn’t care. I turned up the radio, switched on the seat heater, and drove aimlessly, letting the bumps in the road jar my racing thoughts. For a moment, I thought maybe I could shake loose the chaos inside me, but all I managed to do was likely scare my poor husband. He must have been worried sick. I feel awful about that, it wasnt my intention... but I needed the solitude, even if it didn’t bring the peace I was looking for.\n\nRight now, I just feel off—adrift in a sea of emotions I can’t quite name or tame. Hope is there, somewhere, but it’s fragile and flickering. I’m holding on to it, though, because it’s all I can do.",

Most people will suggest to seek support from friends and family but I don’t have many friends and don’t want to burden my family with my emotions. The only person that would even care if I was gone is my mom. She has given me one last reason to try but I don’t know where to begin to heal.",

I truly don't want to sound like I think I have it the worst or like anyone should feel pity for me. I more just wanted to get some things out anonymously.

Nothing every happened regarding it, I'd just keep returning because I had no idea how else to describe it besides just a strong feeling of dizziness. As I've gotten older, I've come to the realization that all those times it was extremely strong feelings of sadness. Really really strong. Sunday's especially would be the strongest because i hated having to go to school. I was never allowed to get any grades lower than an A, and i hated knowing that I had to always perform, and that's stuck with me up to today and being in college, I'm still keeping that streak up but the stress to perform has never gone away. Regardless, I know thats a common thing, but yea, I just constantly, since i was little, have found such little meaning in life knowing that there's not much more to it than being as perfect as i can. I love my parents and dont think theyve done anything wrong, I love my family in general, but almost everyday I wish that I didnt love my family so much and have a loving family so that i could just end my life without having it be a burden on anyone else. I dont really find much pleasure in anything, and the second i feel any pleasure, i bring myself back to reality. I hate the way i look, i hate my genetics, and i just hate myself. The problem is im never going to kms because my family loves me too much, and so do i, but lord, i do truly wish at times that I didnt have this type of family, cause ending it would be so much easier. Life is so incredibly meaningless. I want to retire my parents, have them stop working, give the rest of my money and valuables to my brother so that he doesnt have to work, and then just end my life.

        "Upvotes": 5,
        "Text": "This may be long but I desperately need some opinions or advice, I have no one to talk to, no friends at all. (40/F) So I left my abuse husband of 10+ years due to abuse. A good 4 years before I left I had developed severe depressed and anxiety. For context, I was diagnosed with ocd, borderline personality disorder, and I have PTSD. When I was with my husband he would insinuate that my anxiety and depression weren’t real and he would gaslight like crazy. I finally got the courage to leave and I now live with my mother since May. \n\nHere’s my issue: I have not attempted to go to therapy, every job I have actually got hired for, some how I end up screwing it up and it didn’t work out, I’m totally dirty, I have always been messy, but never dirty. I just don’t care at all, it just feels impossible. I don’t care about hygiene, if I have a sheet on my bed. I’m not trying to use my depression as an excuse, but I don’t understand why this is happening. \n\nFor context: my dad committed suicide when I was 13 due to depression. Another thing too is my brother had taken a plea deal for 20 years for messing with kids. My mother talks about him like he is this stand up guy, doesn’t believe he did it at all and blames the mother of his kids. Growing up he was always the favorite because he was “so smart”, after my dad died, he became an addict but she still treated him and talked about him as if he wasn’t. I was always pushed aside due to this. She was perfectly fine going off on me in the past because she couldn’t take it out on him. There was a time where I had pissed her off and she got on the phone with my brother, mind you he is in prison at this time, she gets on the phone with him and talks to him like he is not in prison but as if her son lives out of state. She then proceeded to talk about me to him. She was venting like he was her friend. My brother is a fucking pedophile and she talks like he’s not and blames the mother of his kids and it’s infuriating. \n\nSo my room is just so dirty, I’m super embarrassed even admitting it. I have never been this depressed before ever. My husband is an evil monster who won’t need to take any sort of accountability or responsibility for anything. If I stayed any longer I can see him following through trying to end my life. So this morning she ended up seeing my room and definitely didn’t hide her disgust. I am by no means saying she’s wrong, she has every right considering it’s her home and all that, but now I’m in a sort of disassociated state. I cannot talk to my mother, I can’t say she’s a narcissist but has characteristics. Before I moved in, I 100% thought she was a covert narcissist my entire life. Only reason I’m backing off from that some is because she has surprisingly been more empathetic and for the first time ever actually apologized to me when we had an argument. Mind you I was at the point where I was having a full blown panic attack, crying and being super super loud because it had revolved around my husband. \n\nSo I don’t even know what I’m even asking honestly. Am I right to say that my severe depression is a cause for a dirty environment or is it more of an excuse? I have never in my life been this depressed ever. ",

All he coukd is see me spiral and could not do anything to help me. I checked in to a hospital voluntary for help but all I want to is run, disappear and never look back. I feel like my life is worthless. I love my husband and family, but I just don't want to be around anyone. I want to be alone. I feel like I deserve to be alone. Once I do start run all I think about is my husband and the pain it will cause him. If I run or end it, I'll hurt him but if I don't all I think about is being alone and my disappointment. I don't know what to do. I just want to stop feeling.",

The only goal I can imagine for myself is become rich and well, that’s it (yeah, I can imagine the way I am living in this dream, they say if you can imagine it, you can achieve it, but meh. As for now, I don’t know how to succeed in this).\n\nAnd I am not saying my life is shit or something in this way, I am currently on my second year in great (not bad for sure) university, on a program I like, I work remotely and making small (but still, I am 18 btw) amount of money.\nBut you know, after watching this movie, I think there is nothing for me that important (I would even say vital) as tennis for Zendaya. By saying that, I mean for her tennis was everything, she was living it, and she saw (in the end of the movie) a “fucking great game” (she said something like this in the beginning) and she was so excited about it…well…I just can’t imagine (as for now at least) something that could be that huge for me.\n\nMaybe I just need to sleep and this will get me relief.\nThank you for reading this\n\n\nP.s.

It's just kinda funny that for all my thoughts of suicide when it really comes down to it I fail at that too. It makes me wonder what the point of it all even is. What's the point of wishing for death when I can't even follow through with it? What's the point of being so depressed when I can't even do anything to end it? I can't live my life happily but I don't even have the balls to stop living. I'm just stuck in limbo. I'm a failure at this 'depression' thing too, and I guess that's kinda funny to me.",

        "Text": "My cousin died nine years ago, and I think I’ve obsessively thought about him ever since.\n\nWe weren’t super close, but he was always fun to be around when I was a kid. He was kind of like the black sheep of the family—not in a bad way, but just because he was \"different\" for someone in a Black immigrant family. He liked rock music, loved superheroes, and had a bunch of piercings. I always thought he was pretty cool.\n\nHe was 28 when he died. I’m almost 26 now, and I still think about him a lot. Especially since I'm getting closer to the age he was.  \n\nBefore, when I thought of him, I always felt like he was an example of someone who was still figuring things out. It gave me hope that if I didn’t have my life 100% figured out yet, at least I knew someone who was working on theirs—even if his life was, unfortunately, cut short.\n\nBut I also realize now that my thoughts about him have held me back, too. He died in a car accident, and for the past nine years, I’ve been extremely terrified of driving. It doesn’t happen anymore, but I used to have panic attacks behind the wheel. I still get very nervous when driving and only do it when I absolutely have to.\n\nWhen he died, he was just starting to get his life together—settling down with his gf, starting a new job, and planning a family Christmas party. He died 12 days before Christmas that year. I just keep thinking about how he didn’t get a chance, and it scares me. What if, when I finally start getting my life together, I die before I ever get to enjoy it?\n\nSo, I don’t know. Am I using him as a crutch? I hope not, because this isn’t how I wanted to remember him.\n",

        "Text": "At the time, I was too young to realize that the sexual abuse wasn't my fault. I know that now. I thought sharing the perspective of a 14 year old dealing with depression was worth sharing to this community. This is word-for-word from an email I sent to myself at the time (so please excuse poor grammar):\n\n  \nI don't know what it is, it's really hard to explain. It's like something that I wish someone else could explain to me, because I have no idea what it really is. It's just this thing that seems to constantly surround my mind in a greasy film, a film which is the feeling you get after you throw 3 parts guilt, 2 parts uncertainty, 1 part worthless, and one million parts stupid into a blender. This film acts like a filter to thoughts, taking all of them and grinding them up into something dark and ugly. Most of the time, I can't even understand exactly what these thoughts are getting at, just a repetitive occurance spinning around in my head. All I really want to do is turn off the blender, but I can't find the off button, let alone the cord. \n\nI'll find myself thinking things I wouldn't EVER say, actually DOING things I would never have done, and not really know how I allowed myself to get to that point. I'll take myself away from it, promise myself to never do it or think it again, but it always seems to repeat itself. I have myself in this cycle that is impossible to get out of, and I just want it to stop completely. It's not like I'm never happy, that would be stupid to say, but I would do anything to be happy without the greasy film in my mind screaming through the back of my eyes. Some of the time, I can't even remember conversations or happenings with other people, because I can't pull my focus away from this wretched screaming thing in my mind. The most frusterating thing is I can't even manage to understand what this horrible thing is even screaming about. It's so hard to explain, it's like it knows what it's screaming about, and it's just as frustrated with me because I can't understand the language it's speaking in.\n\nAnother downside, when I do start to understand just a little piece of what it's saying, it doesn't actually make me feel any better, it actually makes me feel quite a bit worse, because I've realized, yet again, how incredibly stupid I've been. Sometimes, I'll have even have a couple weeks where I feel completely well and happy, and I'll think it's over, I've finally gotten over it! But no, it never goes on longer than that. I'm so weak. I hate how I actually have a great life, with every possible advantage to basically anything I could want, not to mention a pretty amazing family to fall back on whenever I need them... but it's stupid how I can actually know that, be completely aware that I'm taking advantage of it, and hate that I'm doing it... but not change. I do NOT, in ANY way, deserve the friends I've somehow kept, anything I own, or ANY advantage I've been given in life. Why Jaime is still going out with me, I'll never understand. Literally ANY aspect I contribute, he can do way better. It's more of just waiting for that moment when he realizes this, if he hasn't already. \n\nI hate how every \"problem\" I've ever created in my head, was merely just that, something I've made up in my head. The little things that I constantly go over and over, trying to find an answer to \"WHY\" am I thinking this, \"WHY\" am I doing these crazy things to myself? Those little things are useless and immature, the kind of things that anyone else should pass off as nothing. But yet, I let these little things get torn up into even smaller things by that blender in my mind, torn up to be so small that they tear through and infest anything else in my mind, reproduce and expand like bacteria, until they become the main area of my thoughts. The only reason these things get to me, is because I have nothing better to think about, I don't have a life outside it. I stay home all day, and the dumbest thing about that is that I hate it, but I do it completely by choice.\n\nThat choice to stay home, since it started, has only made things get so much worse. Since running out on so many good friends who would have always been there for me, since quitting dance and everything else, since then my mentality went completely downhill, especially november/december. I'd give anything to redo those 2 monthes over again. I sometimes wish that something bad and terrible would actually happen in my life, so I would actually have something to be feeling badly about. I don't deserve anything I have, it's pathetic. I mean, I'm writing an email to myself... that pretty much explains my loserishness right there.",

My wife is and has been always abusive and mean. She is very narsistic and i do feel like she drains my energy to the very bottom. As soon as i want to give up on our marriage, she manipulates me with the 2 kids we have together. I feel like I am letting my kids down if I leave this woman, but this last 2 years have been hell for me so i recently got away from her. Last thursday I talked to her and she was all positive about our relationship, but she brought up our last arguments and fights before and then she said nothing will happen to her and the kids would care more, so she made me feel bad for leaving them. My brain feels very foggy, i cannot focus anymore, i dont enjoy anything anymore. I always watched movies, played games but even those are very boring to me atm. I recently started with gym but it takes a lot of effort for me to actually be active anymore. I really do not know what steps i should take. I started with therapy but had only 2 sessions now, but feels like it goes nowhere. Who else has a narsistic wife/gf and been through this and what did work out for you guys, how did you get back in life. I am trying my very best to find any help i could get.

        "Text": "It’s so strange to me that I’ve only now realized that I have chronic depression. I’ve known I’ve been depressed for over a decade, but it just never clicked for me until recently that it’s classified as a chronic illness.\n\nA lot of days I just… live with it. I think I was born sad, and I’m never Not sad, but that’s just how I’m built, I think. I’ve never lived without sadness, even if it's just a small thought in the very back of my mind.\n\nEven when I'm feeling okay or even happy, there's just a fog that always hangs over me. I'm only 20, but I have a feeling this dread might never go away. I think I'm okay with it, only if it's because I might have to be. I've been on SSRIs for over a decade-- started young with trying out different meds until we found one that worked. I can't even really say if I was lucky for it or not. I'm not going to try it, but I often wonder how I'd be if I just stopped taking them. Realistically, probably not well-- but I've taken them for so long I don't really remember life without medication.\n\nIt just kind of astounds me that depression is something that some people can just get over. A hiccup in the road, even if it lasts for a month or years. I just don't see my life without sadness in it. And I know even if I wasn't mentally ill I'd get sad; everyone does and I know that, but it feels like, for me at least, like my brain's just sorta marinated in it for so long that the stain will never disappear.\n\nLike you can dump coffee on a white shirt and most of the time it'll come out-- maybe a small stain, but it's unnoticeable unless you examine it closely. I think it's like even in the womb I was soaked in coffee for so long there is quite literally no chance of coming out with a clean shirt. Maybe a stupid metaphor, but I hope it gets the imagery across.\n\nI'm leagues over where I used to be and I don't think about dying that much anymore, but it's always there even if I can't see it. It feels like an out. Like an escape. I'm doing things, I'm trying things-- all to plan for a future for myself that I can't visualize. And if it doesn't work out, I know I'll either hoist myself up and keep going, even if it takes agonizingly longer than everyone else; or find a way to get away from this world.\n\nAll of my family-- on both sides-- have some kind of mental illness. I'm sure a lot of families do, but a lot of people aren't diagnosed. I love my parents, and I'm lucky enough to say that. But sometimes I wonder how it'd be if they didn't have similar (if not the same) issues that I do. And if I didn't have them, either. I don't know what would change, if anything at all.\n\nI've always been writing, and I think I'll most likely continue to do so. But I'm always scared for a day if my words run out. I'm scared that the things keeping me here, keeping me grounded will leave and I won't be able to hold on. I don't know what will come, if anything will or nothing at all. I think I'm always just taking things one day at a time. I hope that someday in the future I'll find a way to pull my mind out of the sludge it's been dipped in, as well as the same for others. All I have is hope. It's small. But I'll hold it until I can't anymore.",

Things feel like they’re progressively getting worse.\n\nI feel like I’ve experienced and read so many fascinating and mind-bending stories and listened to wonderful songs that it would okay if I died at any moment. I keeping thinking that if I die at least I’ll be able to engross myself and relive so pieces of fiction and continue to “exist” in my own little world. (I’m not religious). Sometimes I wish I could just stay in my own world and think. It’s all I do. I barely eat and overindulge on sleep. I avoid talking to anyone and have a bad attitude when I do. I don’t go outside. Being alive and having people who know me irl makes me feel awful and guilty. Dreams and fiction can be whatever I want so I don’t know why I even continue to breathe. My real life doesn’t feel as appealing as a fake one. I don’t really know what to think or do besides fantasize and daydream.\n\nIt’s been getting harder and harder to take care of myself. My hatred of my own body and self drives me further from doing anything for it. The mind is an amazing and beautiful thing. I only want to stay inside it forever.\n\nPretty much: every waking day feels worse than yesterday and makes delving into a delusional fantasy comforting. Just wanted to type my feelings on the internet and see if anyone can relate. I can hardly ever make myself say my feelings and thoughts aloud so maybe this will help. I’m not looking for professional help. I’ve never received any and I don’t want it or need it. It would only make me feel more guilty.",

        "Text": "I want to start this off by saying I love my dad dearly and I always want him to feel like he is able to come to me and not like he has to hide how he is truly feeling. \n\nMy dad is a 60 year old man who has had a rough go of it in his life, he has always dealt with mental health issues surrounding depression, but it has gotten worse in the last year due to a break up. He also is no longer taking medication what he was for many years. He stopped when he was in a more stable state of mind, but I truly think he needs to be back on something. he frequently has no motivation and is extremely down. I can barely get him to leave the house. He does not work, he has very few friends and typically only sees them a few times a year and really does not have any hobbies besides taking walks and watching re runs. He also struggles with chronic back pain and is somewhat limited and what he can do due to this. He has been on disability from his back for multiple years. \n\nSince his break up, he has very much felt worthless, and after over a year, he is still just as sad as he was when it first happened, I almost think it is worse. He frequently says how he feels so unwanted and so useless, but doesn’t take any action to change his life. I have encouraged him to join meet up groups, Start dating again so he can find his person, or to pick up hobbies he used to enjoy when he was younger, like writing, reading novels, antiquing, and other things that would not require too much of him with his back issues and would allow him to get to know himself again and build up his self esteem. \n\nSo far in the last year, all he has done is attend one volunteer orientation For an animal rescue. He no longer wants to participate in family activities and rarely wants to even visit with me. When I text him, he gives me one word answers, and frequently spends his time sleeping. I don’t know what else I can do for him, but I feel like as a man, he almost needs some sort of tough love. I have tried the emotional route and being there for him when he sends me very long messages about how horrible he feels, but in my opinion it has been too long of him feeling this way. I know for a depression diagnosis I believe it is around six months of symptoms and he has well exceeded that, and yet he refuses to go back and get medication even though he says he does probably need it. He also does not believe counseling has ever made a difference for him and is not interested in counseling. How can I give him a kick in the ass to propel him into wanting to make changes for himself instead of feeling so worthless? I don’t want to damage our relationship as I am one of the few people in his life, but I also don’t want to enable him or abandon him. \n\nSome days I am genuinely concerned that he is going to harm himself because in the past, he has self harmed and sometimes his statements just seems so profoundly done with life. I am not currently concerned with his safety. I think he just is sort of giving up, it is like he is alive without actually participating in life. \n\nTLDR:  how can I support depressed father who will not take any action to help himself? ",

There's no convincing him to get up and just try to work his way through it. I don't have depression, so I can't see his point of view. And I wish I could empathize with it. \nWhen the chickens need taken care of, and a fence needs repair, or the sheeps need sheared, or the tomatoes need harvested, I feel like it's just going to fall in my shoulders each and every time. He doesn't sometimes, but he's not reliable. \n\nOn top of this, he puts no money away for us. He doesn't want a job. He says it will make him more depressed. The last time he had a job was over 2 years ago. He doesn't really seem to want to contribute financially at all. Every single date we go on I pay for. And I don't have the same conditions that his other partner has. I never wanted to fully support him. I thought he would be getting a job or making some money at some point. I didn't realize he would be fully relying on his other partner and I. \n\nIn my eyes, he's living the dream. He can game whenever he wants, he has basic chores to do. He has to care for the animals that we have, and that's about it. He has a lot of free time. \n\nIs there any way that I can motivate him to put in more effort? Contribute to the family? Contribute to the finances? I almost feel selfish asking because I simply don't understand depression that well. But I figured asking here might give me a bit of insight. ",

My mother should not know this. My neighbour are 26 years old and 27 years old girls. They stay together and talk very sweet. They treat me good too. My mum had to leave to Village and would come only in the late eve. So she told me to stay with these neighbour. That one girl told me that I look sick, so she asked me to breathe. She started touching me on my back, neck and hands. She asked me if I am scared and told me not to worry. The other girl told me to lie down and she pulled my shorts down. I told them , that I am ok and feeling good. I have no sickness. She said body accumulates poisons and it goes via toilet. I was in underwear. The other girl asked if I can pull the underwear off. I said no. I told them my mum told me never to allow anyone to touch. Then she said, don't worry, I will call your mother. She dialled my mother and started talking with her, that girl said let me tell your mum the procedure and she went in another room. My mom told me to listen to them. My mother told me to take off my pants and also told me that those girls will help you with new ones. The call was disconnected. I had no option than to take off my underwear too.  The girls were looking at my private parts. They asked me that I am dirty. They applied me soap and with some sharp tool and removed my hair.  They also said that I  still have no moustache because of poisons in my body. I felt comfortable at this point because they were explaining me nicely just like my family doctor. She asked my to make my private part straight. I said it I don't know how to make it straight. She said give it try. I said it becomes straight only in the early morning and never else. They laughed at me.I was also laughing with them. They she pulled my skin and said , see this white stuff. These are poisons. They told me to take the smell. It was disgusting. They cleaned it. She asked me , hope you believe us that we both are helping you. She asked, your friends did not tell you all these. I said no, we never talk these type of things. I said now let me wear the clothes. She said cleaning is not done. She brought a water colour brush, very soft one and said that this brush helps to clean. She was very slow moving that brush on below portion of the thick part of my private. My private part was becoming straight and then I felt some weird pain kind of thing and my legs also felt numb and cold and white liquid came out 5-6 times and my body temperature increased. After that the part was paining. She told that pain will go in 1 hour. Told me not to tell my mummy. \n\nShould I tell this to my mother? Is this perfectly ok? Or I am simply overthinking and doubting our neighbours? My English is not good so sorry in early. \nToday they brought nice sweets for me and took me for a drive too.

But I've always hid it to the point where it's just a thought that never leaves, a feeling that never changes. It just is and always will be. I've tried medication, therapy, everything, but I can never explain it well and I just lie about it getting better.\n\nI can't do anything I want to do. I just keep going without doing anything remotely special. This includes suicide. I can't kill myself. It's not that I don't want to, but it's like getting out of bed or doing work for me. It's just another chore I slowly forget to consider. At this point, the only satisfaction I get is watching my life get worse.\n\nI've hurt myself, but not because I wanted it over. I just wanted someone to maybe care. They aways suggest going to the hospital, but it's not a big enough problem for me to. I'm not actively trying to die like some people; my childhood was fine; I can function normally. I'm not really suffering. If I went to the hospital, I'd just tell them I'm fine now and they'd believe it, and nothing would change.\n\nI rot with my own emotions, day after day, never being able to do anything about it. It just gets worse, and I feel less encouraged to do anything. But I just keep going. I have to. I don't want to, but killing myself is too much a chore and I'd rather sleep.\n\nEdit: I've decided to take control of my life for once! I'm planning on killing myself tonight.",

        "Text": "My life has been hard as hell. I (43/m) was bullied from 1st grade (1987 at 6 years old) to 11th grade (1998 at 17 years old) when I dropped out. I went Bald at 15/16 (due to years of intense anger and stress at such a young age), developed Agoraphobia by age 18, and went into my adult years with a ton of damage and crippling anxiety that has kept me isolated from the world...As an adult, I have been through a lot of depression and emptiness. I was dirt poor working horrible low paying stressful jobs living in endless depression and I was constantly rejected by women...I found some joy by living in the moment, and I was content in solitude (weed helped a lot), but I was never happy and always stressed out about money. That is until, at the age of 34 (in 2015) I received an inheritance and went from dirt poor, to being rich and not having to work or leave my house. I discovered a level of happiness that I didn't know was possible. The money was in a portfolio and was growing fast, my mother controlled it and we lived off the interest while letting it grow, or at least that was the plan. After living in extreme happiness for 3 years, in November of 2018 I found out my mother gambled it all away and it completely killed me. I have spent these last 6 years dragging myself through every day. I miss that stress free perfect happiness that I had. I was so depressed and drained from life that I would have \"ended it\" back in 2018, but I had a goddaughter to raise and could not bring myself to abandon her.\n\nYou see, before finding out the money was gone, I invited my friend to move in with me so I could help her raise her daughter since her biological dad left before she was born and I saw how bad she was struggling to raise her by herself. I had time and money, and decided to be a parent. They moved in a few weeks before I found out the money was gone, and I have been suffering through each day for the sake of this little girl who would be lost without me. Over these 6 years, I experienced the worst thing ever...Insomnia. First time was in 2020, when I was working a horrible stressful job and it caused me non stop anxiety which led to Insomnia and panic attacks for over a month. My mental health was the lowest it could possibly go and I was close to giving up on life when I was saved by the Pandemic (what an ironic thing to say). I got 18 months of unemployment and was able to sleep again. The next job I took after the unemployment ran out, the insomnia hit again after a few months and I got fired for making a stupid mistake because I was mentally drained from 2 weeks without sleep and constant panic attacks. I haven't worked since then, I have been living off savings I built up during the pandemic and I also sold my house and now I just pay rent, so I had money from that as well to live off for a while. I tired to do some side hustle stuff but failed at that, so I have been preparing myself for returning to work.\n\nThis year however, I hit a setback and experienced a whole new level of depression. What happened was, I got caught up in comments over a viral video that I had, and got a lot of hate, then I watched one of my favorite youtuber make a video about me and tear me apart. I wasn't just a fan though, it was more like a good friend had betrayed me in the most public way imaginable. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea I was about to be verbally assaulted like I was. I understand this person didn't know I was on the edge of a mental cliff, but the anger directed at me didn't make any sense. I thought they were gonna be on my side of the situation, but wow was I wrong. The whole thing had a major impact on my mental health due to the circumstances and my desperate need for money and how this person shut down all hope of me getting out of this nightmare...It was surreal to sit there and listen to this person say so many mean things while the chat also said nasty things. The worst insult I have ever heard, came out of this youtubers mouth and it was directed right at me. I couldn't believe it was real...I can type word for word the line because it has rung in my head now for 6 months: \"People f\\*\\*\\*ing hate people who act like this, talk like this, think like this...they f\\*\\*\\*ing hate you, so stop acting like this, or at least hide it\"...but that is just it, I WAS hiding my whole adult life. I stepped out of hiding trying to capture on a viral moment and build from it. But once again, the universe reminds me that I am not allowed. It was like a manifestation of my phobia showed up in real life to take the last bit of hope I had left and remind me how it will always be whenever I interact with the human race. What did I do you ask? It was a horrible evil crime, you see...I tried to sell a T-Shirt...\n\nI am not sure what happened to me mentally, probably a result from intense shock combined with the past 6 years of hell I been living in, but whatever it was, it changed me. Since watching the video and going through all those months of stress, I have developed a much deeper level of fear being in public. The negative experiences just do not seem to ever stop, and I am terrified to experience any more bad memories. No matter what I do in this life, I am left feeling like I did something wrong. I am at the point where if my anxiety is really high and I am around people, my face starts to physically hurt because my muscles tense up and spasm...I don't want to make eye contact with anyone or speak to anyone. I feel a pressure on my brain constantly when I am out of my house and I get bad headaches if I am around too much activity/people. I also get worried (which makes the anxiety worse) that people can see my cheek and neck muscles spasming when it happens. I also feel pressure in my knees like they are going to give out sometimes. I also feel this strong hatred for myself, like intense regret for being who I am...Ugh, I am just a mental mess of depression, anxiety and anger.\n\nI lived with this pain for almost 20 years just fine, but after tasting true happiness and losing it 6 years ago, I am unable to feel anything good anymore. I was trying hard though, I fought the depression and attempted to find a new way in this world, but this year has shown me that there is absolutely no hope. I have seen 5 therapist over these 6 years, and most of them told me I am a difficult case because I am stubborn. They pushed me into trying pills (Venlafaxine) but it only worked for about a week and I started feeling even worse because of the side effects and I refuse to ever try pills again. I just can't see it any other way, my mind is set and made up, the world is horrible and I don't want to be here anymore...I am only here for the kid because I can't think of anything more horrible then abandoning a child to this world...but once she is old enough, I can go without any regrets. My current problem is my money is running out and I know I will have insomnia again once I start working...and I know that will drive me to the end. Come on Universe, give me a break. All I need is enough money to get me through 10 more years so I don't have to get a job, so I don't have to experience weeks without sleep again, so I don't have to abandon this little girl...",

        "Text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm 23. I've been struggling with depression ever since I was about 14/15. I've gone to therapy from 17 to 18, with no effect at all. I haven't really been struggling with this issue before, but recently, I've been heavily struggling to \"feel\" any sense of connection to people, maybe besides my own parents, but even that is heavily diminished. \n\nI've recently gone through a breakup with someone with BPD, she broke up with me. It turned out she always pretended everything was good, while deep down she was always struggling heavily. I learnt she had BPD only after the breakup, but it made a lot of sense. She broke up, it was very, very painful, as it broke my \"fixer\" dynamic that I had with her and I felt that I let her down, despite it not being my fault. A few weeks before the breakup I already felt that another depressive episode was starting, unrelated to her. \n\n  \nNow, I'm used to depressive episodes at this point in my life. I haven't felt this complete inability to \"feel\" connections to others anymore tho, which I guess might be because of the damage of the relationship. I am currently deeply unsure what to do about anything. I've met a therapist about a year and a half ago and had a few talks with him. Basically, he said that he believes there is a brain-chemistry component to my depression, he also believed that my depression caused a life situation that would make anyone unhappy, and that's realistic. At the time, I was unemployed for multiple years, because of depression I barely talked to friends, I had no interests, all that stuff. \n\n  \nI very much took that to heart and thought by fixing those things, maybe I'd be fine and the depression is \"self-caused\" in a way. A while ago I found a well-paying job that is ehhh, okay? It's not necessarily satisfying, but its also not bad. The salary is what makes it attractive and im totally okay with the job overall. I work out, eat somewhat well, I'm doing all the things you're supposed to be doing. For a while, I've spent a lot of time with friends and had fun with them. That changed now, mostly because of the inability to feel any connections. It makes me feel incredibly lonely, even though I have people that I genuinely like around me. Overall, I'm basically doing the things you're supposed to be doing and I feel more miserable than ever before.\n\n  \nI have some interests, although I'm not \"burning\" for them as I used to. They're just okay, but in my free time, I often don't do much in that sense, it just doesn't really interest me as it used to anymore.\n\n  \nI have constant suicidal ideation and full-on fantasies that sometimes make me zone out. I know for a fact that I'm not going to act on them, because I can't do that to my parents. Other than that, nothing is stopping me. I often catch myself wishing they didn't care about me just so I could act on it. \n\n  \nI've contacted a therapist again, and I'm on a waiting list that might just take months or even a year.\n\nMy genuine question: What exactly do I do now? I've done the things you should do, I've done journaling, contacted a therapist, life is \"objectively\" in a good spot with a well-paying job, good parents, good friends. Does anyone have any advice for this situation? ",

Then I get sad and lay in bed for weeks. I can’t cry anymore, haven’t cried in years honestly. I’m just numb and tired. Nothing feels real, but everything feels too real at the same time. This isn’t the worst (anxiety wise) I’ve ever been, but depression wise it’s definitely up there. I’m told by my mil I do nothing so I should be able to keep up on the house. But even that has been hard for me. I literally feel like I’ve succeeded in the day if I get out of bed. Even if I just go straight to the couch and sit. I do maybe a load of laundry a day, but I don’t really touch much else of the house. We have so much stuff I feel like I’m always tripping over something and I just want to throw everything away, couch, table, anything. I love my marriage, that’s the only good thing right now, but then I feel like a garbage wife considering my husband works full time and I can’t even shower alone. ",

I'd lock my room. (Got a bit of trauma from an argument with my mother.) Every day I had these few hours every night, where I just could calm down.\n\nMaybe I didn't deserve these in the first place. I am not working, after all. Maybe I shouldn' have this time.\n\nIn these hours I did not feel, like any minute someone could burst into my room with the intention of a new argument. I felt safe to cry. Depending on my mood I'd sometimes cry multiple days in a row. With time it happens less and less. I feel like I cried most tears I got.\n\nIn recent days though I feel exhausted. Im lying in bed. I can't stand up to do anything, even though I should do a lot. I feel like I am just about to cry, but I control myself. I always have to control myself. And I am thinking about these hours. I feel myself waiting for these few hours of safety. These few hours of me not needing to mask myself for others. I am so fucking sick of it.\n\nI had another small argument with my mother today. In the end she told me, that I should \"learn to be happy\". She sat next to me, when my doctor told me, that I \"obviously am depressed\". She didn't say a word. We never talked about it. My parents do not do such things. And when my father saw the medication, the doctor was prescribing me, he told me, that these antidepressians are bad, that I shouldn't use them, and he talked about side effects, I couldn't find anything about online.\n\nThe sentence \"We have more important things to deal with than your well-being!\" will probably forever reverberate in my head. I couldn't tell you, what else we had to deal with. It was just a day like the another.\n\nI feel like I was happier, when I was in the hospital with the worst pain I've ever expirienced. They gave me morphium, and I wouldn't believe them, as the pain was still so fucking strong. While in pain I didn't think of all the arguments. I didn't think of my shitty life, the future, or my past. Even though I just thought of the next painkiller I felt like I was happier than I had been for the last four and a half years. I wasn't bored, and I didn't needed to be entertained. There was just pain, and it was as simple as that. For once my well-being actually mattered. I had no arguments with my parents. Things were finally simple.\n\nAlthough slowly, my health gets better. And the less room the pain takes in my life, the more my depression returns. The worst pain of my life felt like a vacation from my depression, and I honestly don't know, what felt worse.\n\nI can barely walk for more than a few minutes, and I can't really go anywhere. I just feel like shit.",

Either way, I’m still here and just a shell of myself. \n\nI’ve seen the two friends since and I’m now staying w family, but I wanted to know if it’s normal for friends/family to not ask about it, or if it’s normal to make “I’ll kill myself” jokes 5 months after the fact etc. I don’t feel seen, and I’m starting to think it’s not a big deal cause if everyone around me is like “well you’re alive so it doesn’t matter”, I feel like I should be “more adult” and just find a way to just get over it. To be clear, I haven’t made any attempts since, but when I say so many things have changed for the worse, I just feel like no one cares? Which is fine, I just want to know if not having support in situations like this is normal?

I can't just end my life because i might ruin my families life, some old friends might hear about it and they'll blame themselves, one of my friends will literally be alone, and I'll essentially throw away everything everyone has done for me by ending my own life. As badly as I want to cut the thread tethering me to life, I simply cannot. That's why I always fantasize about a world where I was never born; it's comforting in an odd way.\n\n  \nThe closest I believe I can get to not existing without doing any of the damage is just sleeping for most of the day. If I find myself feeling frightened or anxious, I'll force myself to sleep; if I have a fit of depression, then I will just sleep it off too. At least when I'm asleep, I can retreat to a world where I'm not thinking about my shitty existence. I'm so tired of living at this point; no matter how fast I run, my fucking struggles come back in some fashion, typically worse than the first round of mental bullshit.\n\n  \nIs there just something wrong with me? Ever since I was 6, I've been dealing with this along with suicidal thoughts. At the start, it was just my mom that brought upon these thoughts, but as I kept living, I just found more reasons not to carry on. Not like I can change the past, though; no matter how much I think about it and wish for it to change, it's just not going to. \n\nI don't have anyone to talk to about these things anymore. I already tired out my ex enough with my stupid depressive tendencies; talking to her now just won't help how bad I already feel. I can't bring myself to talk to friends, and I haven't been able to for months. I'm such a failure. I should be able to fight this off on my own, but I can't, and getting help from others has never done anything for me. I think I'm just a lost cause. I'm better off dead at this point; I just waste everyone's time. \n\nI've gotten all the advice and help i can get and im still just as depressed as before (if not worse). and ive already pushed everyone away. even if the loneliness is crippling, what good would it do to have connections when i just run away from them..\n\n  \nwhat the hell is the point of trying anymore\n\n  \nsorry if this is too long and very inconsistent, im just anxious and stressed. too stressed to keep my head on straight\n\n  \ni wish i could hug someone right now",

It feels pandering and is a clear attempt to shift the blame of poor mental health onto the person that is depressed. It’s an hour long presentation of “if you try hard enough you can think yourself happy.”\n\nI’m enduring one right now. Shifting my mindset like they are alleging doesn’t change me from wishing to be hit by a truck on my way to work. It’s so grossly out of touch and the companies believe that they are sending a good message. But those of us (at least the ones I’ve talked to that watch these) that DO struggle with our mental health can see through it as a way of the company saying “it’s not us, it’s you.” It gives them the ability to ignore the poor pay, poor staffing, and aggressive public that we deal with and tell us that we just need to change our perspective and try harder to plan our lives outside of work to account for self care. \n\nSome people buy into it, but those people are generally content with their lives. If you want to help us feel better, bare minimum hire enough staff to handle the workloads. But the companies won’t because they don’t care. But if I’m hanging on by a thread, telling me to hang on tighter doesn’t actually help. Maybe throw me a rope if you’re not going to pull me up?\n\nAnd I’m sure that some people are going to disagree with me, and maybe some companies actually make these presentations useful, but the ones I have sat through the last 10 years all have the same emotion: WE (the presenters and upper management) are doing fine so we don’t care about you. Just try harder to meet our impossible expectations and maybe you’ll be happy on your own effort.",

I am not asking for advice or anything beyond that, I just need some insight regarding tying up loose ends.  This may not be the correct subreddit, but I don’t know where else to go.  \nI’m a married man with a 3 year old son living in NYC.  I’ve been very unhappy for a long time, and have drifted away and lost any emotional connection to my wife and son.  I’m going through the motions, but I’ve totally lost myself and don’t even recognize who I am anymore.  \nI work in a very high stress job that pays well, but the hours are very demanding.  I used to enjoy the thrill of my job, but now I dread it immensely.  My weekends are spent buried in my phone, sleeping, or pacing.  My wife is unhappy with me and our marriage, so we’ve been doing marriage counseling weekly for over a year, and I’m in individual counseling every Sunday.  I hate it.  I’m not honest in my sessions, and usually hungover.  I’ve always had issues with alcohol and I drink on the weekends and sometimes during the week to get numb and escape.  Ive cut back on the alcohol quite a bit though.  I’ve also started doing a lot of cocaine, which is the only thing I enjoy.  Otherwise I’m totally anhedonic, asexual, asocial, and generally miserable.  I feel so guilty all the time because I’m living a terrible life, but I have no intention of turning it around.  I don’t know how.  It feels forced and fake, and won’t last.  \nAnyways, I’ve made some plans which I will not discuss, but I need help making sure I’m not missing anything.  I want to make sure my wife and son are taken care of.  I have a couple bank accounts, a retirement account, a few different investments accounts, a life insurance policy, and a mortgage.  My wife is the beneficiary on most of the accounts (life insurance, retirement).  She is not aware of where all our money is presently.  Should I list all the different accounts, with passwords so she can login and manage them?  Also I don’t have a will, is that something i should consider?  Is there anything else i need to take into consideration?  I would like to move on this quickly, i don’t want anything to do with the holidays.  Thank you",

Suddenly I can't see the progress I made and I come crashing down time after time. It's like my default state is being miserable and depressed. I hate it.\nI loose friends, jobs and education every time. \nWhen I'm running, I can conquer the world and anything is possible! But its never long lasting.\n\nI've tried to take my own life before in 2023 and I feel like I'm going down the same path again. I've never told anyone. I'm just too ashamed of myself.\nI've written a pre-death probate and a letter to the people closest to me if anything should happen.\n\nI find no joy in anything, amd I haven't since I was 15. Family and friends never seems to quite understand. \nHow do I keep going? I need help.\n\nSorry for my bad English.",

I just started psychiatry but I’m ready to start therapy. I have never done therapy before. However I’ve been searching online for therapist and for some reason it’s being very complicated. It also keeps making me do online visits. I want in person visits so I can force myself to get out of the house. \n\nAlso, what should I be doing right now? Like should I be searching for a hobby or something? Should I be exercising? Idk what to do.\n\nWhat do I need to search to find help? Is there an app or is there a specific therapist I need? Like someone who treats severe depression? I know nothing about this. Pls help 🙏",

Who doesn't understand that everyone has their soft corner everyone has their sensitive topics which they don't like to be taunted about. There's zero emotional maturity. And I feel alone and misunderstood and judged all the time. I'm not yet financially independent so I can't go somewhere else it feels like I'm stuck here it feels like I'm bound to feel like this and live with these people.",

All I've been doing for the past few months was ruminating about my past and my future to the point where I've been vomiting into a cup almost every morning. I feel like I've overestimated the possibility of healing from all my trauma, past mistakes, self-esteem, worries, self-loathig, unwanted thoughts, etc.\n\nOne of the things I've been doing was googling for reassurance, which I know now wasn't the best idea. I knew it always hasn't been anyway but not to the extent of today. And honestly, as I'm writing this post with my legs shaking, I'm rocking back and fourth about posting it because I feel like I don't deserve any help, sympathy or happiness. I regret my past so much and always look back at it with the biggest disgust and hatred and wish I did things differently. I truly feel like I ruined my life big time, I feel like I have no future.\n\nI know we all make mistakes but I always feel so unique compared to everyone around me and feel like no one has gone to the extent of what I did. Even though I know there are people out there who have done way worse than I have, I can't help but categorize myself with those people anyway. I keep hoping that I would never repeat those mistakes ever again and I do my best every day not to... because I don't want to. But I can't help but feel like I'm gonna give in one day, as much as I really don't want to. It's like my mind is telling me it's my destiny, but I don't want any part of it. I just want to live an entirely different life. I want to be better. I want to be a good person and I don't want to disappoint anyone.\n\nI honestly feel like the best thing for me and for everyone right now is to just end my life and end all this misery and discomfort I bring to the table - towards everyone and towards myself. The people who know me tell me that I shouldn't and want me to stay and be okay and stuff but I can't help but feel like all I'm doing is making things harder for them (and for me). I just wish to have never existed, wish I lived an entirely different life and I wish I hadn't done the things I done in the past so that I could avoid bringing more and more burden to the table. \n\nI hate myself so much, I can't look at myself in the mirror without wanting to gag and just punch what I see. Every time I even think about myself, all I see is this disgusting piece of shit of a human being who doesn't deserve happiness, love, success, help, sympathy and all the wonderful things that everyone else deserves.

I have a stutter too, and holy shit it has gotten so much worse. \n\nI’ve been crying so much now, it’s not like me.

I fucking yelled at some old lady at the mall last week and I hate myself for it.

I used to have hobbies, I loved making art and being with my friends, I used to laugh *so* hard. It sounds so corny but I will go weeks without cracking a smile or a chuckle. When I try to laugh it feels empy and unfamiliar to me. \n\nI seriously cannot remember the last time I have really felt happy, or at minimum content. I kind of just exist now. I am so exhausted and I have been so worn down by this ass fuck of a mental illness that I cannot bring myself to care about pretty much anything. I don't even necessarily feel sad anymore but I feel completely apathetic and unphased by everything. I feel like I'm floating most of the day and at the end of the day it sometimes feels fuzzy, like I'm not sure if the last 16 hours just happened. \n\nI've also noticed I've become more reckless and angry and brash with people. I used to be such a pushover in the sense I wanted to make people like me. Now I could not give less of a fuck if people like me so long as I can get the social interaction over with as soon as possible. I start fights and instigate and break the law and drink before class and I have no self control or need to bite my tongue anymore. I know it makes me come off as a huge bitch, and tbh I probably am, but I just do. Not. Care. I go days without talking to people, I don't go to lecture unless it's required, I don't leave my apartment if I can help it. I don't know if this is normal but I feel like the damage depression has done to my brain is irreversible. It took away pretty much everything from me and I don't feel the need to be alive a lot longer, I really cannot see myself reverting to the person I was when I was content. \n\nIdk, not really looking for advice. I know I will probably die by suicide over anything else. I plan on kind of just fucking around until I want to buy a gun and then I'll blow my brains out.",

        "Text": "So I (27M) have been officially diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder, and panic disorder since 2015. However I have had mental/emotional issues for as long as I can remember. I would get panic attacks as a child, but I didn’t know what that was at the time. I was a shy, anxious, sad little kid despite having a healthy upbringing. I guess I was just born with a defective brain, it runs in the family. My own mother has tried to kill herself a few times, and that was traumatic to witness. She is doing alot better now thankfully.\n\nAnyway, I have had a few friends and even my own sister (we are very close) suggest that I almost definitely have Borderline Personality Disorder. At first I was offended but now I realize they were all right! Every symptom, all of it. I always knew I had something more than just depression. This is a puzzle I have been trying to solve my entire life. It all makes sense!\n\nWhat really solidified that I most definitely have BPD is the girl I am currently dating, she has BPD (all my partners have had it oddly enough). We got into a deep discussion when I asked her what BPD feels like to her and how I can help. She went into lots of detail and it was like she was describing me. The suicidal stuff, the “everybody pretends to like me but secretly they hate me. I am a burden I should disappear” stuff, the manic to suicidally depressed roller coaster which changes at the flip of a switch, the substance abuse. I mean just everything. She was like “yea I honestly think you are borderline too” and I felt at peace, the way she was okay with this and seemed to just understand how my brain works. \n\nThe next day I guess we both triggered eachother because we both ended up having a huge blowout argument in public. It was ugly, it was my fault mostly. I was being an asshole over something small and I pushed all her buttons. It felt like we both lost control, I have never yelled like that in public, how embarrassing, and I was 100% sober. Her girl friends were there too and I made her cry. I’ll never raise my voice at her like that again. Later we made up and had great sex, naturally, but this also led to another deep conversation. We talked boundaries and triggers and whatever. Again, we both have similar boundaries. We then started wondering how this will work out long-term if we are both borderline. We can both be very emotionally unstable…\n\nSorry for the long rambling yapping. I just have alot on my mind and wanted to get some opinions. Do you think I have BPD?",

I might also add I have misophonia, a sensitivity to unwanted sounds and in the middle of the night is the only time it's bearable, despite attempting to sound proof the walls.\nLately tho, I've been experiencing VERY vivid dreams and nightmares.

I'm a very high spirited person, a very youthful spirit but this so called \"lifestyle\" is tearing me apart, while I do everything in my power, to get myself out of it to be able to do all those things I've been so dying to do. I want to feel like living again. Could it be that these dreams are telling me something or at the very least because I live such a dull miserable lifestyle that it's manifesting in some sort of form of restlessness?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much 💗 ",

I want to move back, on my own terms, so I can feel a general sense of positivity in my environment.. but finances hold me back. I hate not having access to what I want, when I want it. I wish I was never born so I wouldn’t even be in this situation right now. I’m close to the end of my rope and it feels like everyday I inch closer to it. I’m alone when im not working, and even when im working my thoughts are never good… this life sucks.",

I refused both times as it wasn't initially prescribed, and in general I don't have a problem sleeping. \nMy alarm woke me up at 7:15 am, I stayed in bed a bit. At 7:35am a nurse came by to take blood samples for the analysis. A few minutes later another one came to run a blood test for sugar. \nAround 8:10 am there was breakfast, this time I had to choose between coffee, hot chocolate, water and tea (I went for hot chocolate). For food there was bread with butter and jam.\nAround 8:35 am the nurses came to take my blood pressure, my weight and gave me my meds at a slightly higher dose (duloxetine 90mg instead of 60, they also gave me acetylcysteine as apparently it helps evacuate drugs (curious of the mechanism though, does it help to eliminate them through secretions?). \nTo pass time I watch Legion (kinda gives a new dimension to the whole \"I'm in a mental hospital\" vibe)\nEntry time 10:20\nA physician came by to ask how I'm doing, did a check-up. Then a social assistant came asking about my daughter (if there's anyone to take care of her while I'm gone (so i suppose there are solutions in case you are a single parent)). A little later a nurse came by to do an ECG.\nLater on a psychologist came to ask how I'm doing.\nEntry time 4:15 pm\nAround 11:45 the psychiatrist (not the usual one) came, with two nurses, asked questions about how I feel, how much stuff I was taking, do i still have suicidal thoughts etc. talked for about 30 minutes. \nThen there was lunch. After which I decided to shave, so I had to ask a nurse to open a safe and give me my razor. \nLater on at around 14h we played cards with 2 residents. \n",

I’ve been in therapy pretty consistently for 8 years now, and I’ve tried SO many different medications and cocktails throughout the years and I’m worse than ever before mentally. I started researching high masking autism (already diagnosed with ADHD) and realized just how much I’ve been masking and preforming my whole life to make others happy and comfortable and I can no longer keep up. I haven’t been able to work the majority of this past year because of how bad the anxiety attacks and lows have been. My credit cards are maxed out and I’m close to losing my financed car and tanking my credit score. I’m always tired and struggle to even brush my teeth and shower regularly. I’m type 2 diabetic and was experiencing extremely high blood sugars, and thought that was contributing to my fatigue and overall mental health but I was able to get my numbers in normal range, and I’m not feeling any better and can still sleep 12-14 hours a day. The part that drives me crazy is that I can intellectualize it all, I understand that my thoughts are not rational yet i can’t stop the thoughts and the constant rumination. I hate the fact that my partner takes care of me so much, and feel so much guilt for not being my “best” self for them. I isolate because I don’t want to bring others down and then feel horrible for not reaching out. I don’t talk to most of my family because I’m so ashamed of where I am in life. I genuinely believe my loved ones would be better off without me because of how worthless I feel. I recently had a therapist cross some major boundaries and break my trust, and I started seeing a new therapist, but I’m having a hard time opening up without extreme embarrassment and shame. It got so bad a month back or so that I wrote notes to all my loved ones saying goodbye. I feel like I’m barely surviving and don’t want this to be my life. I feel so selfish and like a total fuck up for being so consumed by my own mental illness. I’m just so tired. Does anyone relate?",

        "Text": "Hello, I coming to ask for some input from anybody who has been in the same predicament as me. My ADHD diagnosis began all the way since I was child, when a family friend noticed I was rowdy and misbehaving all the time. Wasn’t into all the things rowdy boys were usually into though, my mom said I liked to duct tape things together, play with fire, and do crazy things to see what would happen, my actual ADHD diagnoses from the doc was in the 2nd grade where they put me on meds and since then the past 12 years I have been on a few different meds with vyvanse taking the cake for the end of middle school and all of high school where after I went on Mydayis. The meds got me through the school day but after school I didn’t do much, like at all besides watch youtube. Barely had any friends as well since I wasn’t a good communicator and I couldn’t be “normal” but didn’t want to be friends with the “weird” kids. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA so I know I am not stupid and that’s without studying at home but that was with the meds. Recently though I had two professionals tell me they think I was misdiagnosed with ADHD and am actually depressed and have been for a while and the symptoms just looked like ADHD. My therapist thinks I do have ADHD but that’s probably from the depression again since I am so down and lose track of our conversations some times because I can get so out of it. My memory is so bad, especially my working memory and I have a hard time recollecting memories for specific needs like for speaking. Been thinking I just have a low iq but was also told recently by a neurologist that they think I have a normal iq and am having so much trouble because of the depression and once I get it treated life should be so much easier for me but I have a hard time believing that since I think it’s an IQ problem. Going to start talking to my therapist about this more and get on some antidepressants and maybe a stimulant meant for depression. Has anyone seen any luck with this giving them mental clarity and maybe getting rid of some brain fog? I want to go to college and be somewhat successful so I can have a family but I feel like nothing and that I won’t be able to achieve it. Any advice?",

        "Text": "This is a longer read but I cannot express how appreciative I would be for you to take the time to read as we are really going through it and need advice. \n\nMy bf (22M) and I (22F) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 7 months. It’s gone very well and we see each other every 1.5-2 months for a few weeks. He has plans to move to my city when he finishes college this coming May (and just confirmed that those were still his plans a few days ago). \n\nIn past conversations, he has mentioned to me that he went through a depressive episode at one point his senior year of high school. (I don’t know how long it lasted or what pulled him out of it, but I know he never saw a therapist.)\n\nThis (senior) semester of college has been rough for him. He’s taking 7 classes. His godfather (only father figure in his life) got diagnosed with cancer a week after the semester started. He’s been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and has been fighting for a diagnosis appointment which he just hasn’t been able to get (which makes homework so hard to get done adequately, and in turn has impacted his grades and self esteem). It’s his last year living with his 2 roommates which are the best friends he’s ever had in his life, and they’ve all been so insanely busy that’s it’s been hard to hang out. Just - a LOT. This would cause anyone distress. \n\nThe last few weeks, I’ve noticed a shift. It started as less enthusiasm/energy on our calls. I started picking up on the fact that he wasn’t going to the gym (which he normally loves doing). He started being less talkative, and then this week he’s been irritable/in an obviously bad mood. I knew what it was. (I’m in a masters in counseling program and have my BA in psych and neuroscience.) \n\nI wasn’t sure if it was depression, or if it was me. I only have the ability to pick up these things on calls (again, long distance) and started to wonder if it was the *calls* that were making him this way. I asked him about it yesterday. I told him that I’ve noticed a difference and want to ensure that the difference isn’t aimed at me. He said it wasn’t, that he had had a bad day, and that it was because of school and all that he had going on. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry. (Of course I felt horrible.) I asked him if he felt depressed and he said he didn’t think so but I could tell he didn’t want to talk about it further, so I didn’t probe. \n\nI know that depression can make it hard to express things like love or affection in but so many ways and have tried to be so understanding about it. Even though he hasn’t been terribly lovey or affectionate on calls, Today he randomly messaged me and told me that he loved me a lot. (He has never been the type to be extremely verbal with his feelings, so I appreciated this effort so insanely much and it meant the world to me that he still manages that effort with what he’s going through.) When we called several hours ago, I asked him how he was doing today. He said pretty much the same as yesterday and then asked how my day was before falling quiet (he has also been constantly tired and I think he fell asleep for a few minutes). I was letting him rest when I suddenly heard him sigh and say “I think I’m depressed”. It was almost relieving to hear him accept/acknowledge it, but my heart broke for him. \n\nI have severe anxiety that I’ve dealt with for most of my life. Mental health problems are the worst and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. To know that he’s going through what he’s going through crushes me and I wish I could fix it. \n\nSo what now? How do I best support him? I have been regularly validating and supportive, letting him know that I’m there and that I love him and that this isn’t something that he can control. I’m so scared that he’s gonna get deeper into it. I’m also (selfishly) scared that our relationship is going to get neglected or unwanted by him, although he has expressed otherwise thus far. \n\nMy heart is so broken for him. \n\n",

        "Text": "I recently had an ok job with good pay, but I had customers being aggressive and someone threaten my life so I decided to apply for a different position in the same company but I got terminated in the process. The reason why is because I tried applying for a position in the same warehouse where u get dispatched to deliver packages. And they told me I had to resign to go through with the application process and go forward with the assessment to start training but they never sent an email for a whole week until I was told that they found other candidates for the job so I ended getting terminated and lost my current job. I have no money because I’m helping my parents pay bills since they are older now, they are also having a hard time getting work. I never had the opportunity to pursue my hobbies or career choices for college due me not having financial assistance or have any money, my family and I are poor and yet we can’t even get Snap/foodstamps cus we are “making too much”. I have adhd but I can handle it, I have anxiety and depression and was diagnosed but the reason for it because I’m a SA victim since age 6. My parents are also the reason I have bad body image and they used to be physically, mentally and verbally abusive. Since they are older they don’t do that no more. I hate my life and I want to not exist because I feel like I don’t have any reason to be here but just go through cruel and unlucky situations. I’m a failure to me and my family and I feel like I’m tainted and disgusting that I feel like death is too much of a luxury too. I can’t even maintain a relationship because all the men just use me and leave. I do self harm, I chew my fingers to the point I bleed and I can’t stop. I day dream a lot and fantasize dying where people cry for me at my funeral every day. I don’t have any other family here that is blood related except my mom. My dad is my step dad, but he raised me but obviously like I said they were abusive in different forms but now they don’t anymore. I still love them and I don’t hate them but I hate myself. I hate myself to the point that I feel like I’m just a waste of space. All my school years was the worst. I’m a bit happy that I’m done with school but sometimes I do miss learning and want to continue learning but I don’t have money, I’m poor and I’m positive that I will always be poor and stuck in a hole. I really wish I wasn’t born. Sometimes I feel like there is no point in trying anymore because nothing good happens even if it’s something small full of good, the worst shit happen after. I feel like I’m cursed or that I did something bad in my previous life to deserve this fate that I have. My real dad never wanted me when I was born and I feel like my mom hates me because she had a horrible life because of me and that’s why she was treating me horribly that way when I was smaller and tbh I don’t blame her and I understand her but I guess a im too selfish too because I’m still mad her for treating me badly when she had a reason. Honestly I feel like I’m just being delusional when I think that maybe I will have a better outcome in my life but seeing how everything is going, it’s hard to keep a smile on my face no more especially out in public. I hate having keep up a facade and just talk to someone who’ll be kind enough to listen to what I have to say especially when everything is drawing near. I want to be a little selfish and have someone listen to me for once. Im kinda still trying my best to find a job but I have no luck at all and it’s all normal jobs that I’m applying too like fast food chains, retail,and warehouse. But honestly speaking I’m almost done. If this goes on with bad luck there is no point in me existing. It’s better off if I’m dead and forgotten. It sounds lonely but I’m used to it. Anyways It’s nice having to speak out my mind where no one knows me. Thank you for reading my bad written thoughts. Sorry too all for the inconvenience. Have a good day. ",

I’ve never had any romantic relationship like holding hands, kissing etc in my life. Even as an adult living at home they dictate my life to the point, they said they will choose who I will marry. I am basically a slave for them doing what they would want me to do, and it’s making me very depressed and suicidal. I feel like there is no way out and I feel no excitement for anything in my life or in the future, due to all my mental health reasons and what I’m struggling with I quit my job, my parents threaten me and they say I can’t leave when I’m an adult in my 20s. They always then try to gaslight me and say they’ve never done anything bad when they’ve physically and mentally abusive. They push their religious ideals on me as well.\n\nI don’t go out at all, majority of my time I lay in my bed, scroll on social and it’s an endless loop. Everyday for 4 years, it’s been exhausting, I feel like I’ve wasted 4-5 years in my life with nothing going for me. I don’t get ready for the day, it’s the same depressing day each time, I hate it so so so much and I feel like crashing out. I used to have things to look forward to like my birthday and other events, I don’t have friends in person that I talk to or go out with anymore. I stopped contacting them after my parents would “micromanage” me when I would go out. I would get 100 calls from my parents asking where I was within 2 hours of going out, some of my friends were weirded out by that and thought it was odd so they stayed away.  my parents are discriminatory as well so some friends I could never invite over, I am also embarassed of my living conditions, controlling parents so growing up and till now I never ever ever invited any friend to my house, and I think it affected my mental health extremely negatively. I don’t have a license and I refuse to go out to walk in my city, I don’t want to see people I used to know, thriving, when I’m down, I don’t want to see my parents friends out and they’re judging me for being a girl outside. \n\nI hate where I live. I just want to move far away and never come back. I wish I had a different life so so so much, I want to change it. What can I do I just want to leave this place forever? ",

I come back and the plane landed and I was taken out of the airport in an EMS and placed in a mental institution for, at that time, was my 3rd time. I collapsed mentally and couldnt and have not recovered. See, my exwife, she left me in Siberia alone for 6 months, and she later divorced me when I returned to the USA. I am not sure if I left her, or she left me, but the dreadful feeling of not having love in my life and nobody to fight for, it is overwhelming. On top of it, when I do get back home, my sister literally screams at me at the top of her lungs every week for 10 years. It was 2014-2015 I was in Harbin., Heilongjiang (Siberia). My sister turned my omother against me, cops came over a lot, and my life has been at a standstill since. I have massive degrees, and I feel trapped in the city I live in. I absoultely hate life. I want it to stop. I keep listening to the song, \"Dear past, I''ve seen the apocalypse and  iwant to go home.\" I am in many medicaid programs, but they all stopped helping. I have no strings to hold on too. Down the rabbit hole I go. I've been so far gone, my mother had a stroke, and I am just at my limit. Anyways, thanks for listening... :(",

        "Text": "First of all sorry the order might be a little all over the place\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI'm 23. No job. Live with my parents.  \nI used to have a well paying job where i could even work at home and be on the phone all day but the fact i had to constantly talk to rude customers and deal with high stress situations really started killing me, to the point of constant anxiety attacks every morning. \n\nIt's been like a year since then, i took a few courses just to get some money but never really got anything else out of them, my homelife is horrible.  \nI spend all my time at home, as i recently moved i lost all my childhood friends and while i had no trouble making friends during my few years at school here they haven't really lasted.  \nThe only good part of my life is my online friends. Every day we talk,draw,watch stuff, play games together.\n\nNow the real doozy. my parents.  \n**My Mom** is quite literally satan, and it's only getting worse, recently she's gotten this disease that makes her body weak which gives her an excuse not to work while receiving some welfare money, problem is she is extremely abusive ever since my childhood.  \nI'd describe her as someone so miserable that she has to put everyone else around her down in order to feel good about herself.  \nShe yells at me and my dad over nothing, she constantly threatens to kick me out cause i'm not working, and no matter how much stuff at home i do she keeps calling me a house guest, a burden.  \nEver since i started earning money at school she has insisted on taking a part of it, one time she broke my art tablet which i bought myself during my school years, had me lie to the insurance man that it only broke because the electricity of the city went down one time, and when she finally got the money for me to get a new one she instead took it and felt justified in taking it, in her head this was her money because \"i lived here and i needed food to eat too\" keep in mind this was while i was still paying her half of what i earned during my online course at the end of every month.  \nHer marriage with my dad is one of those marriages where you really question yourself how they are not divorced yet and the only reason i can find is due to financial problems.  \nThey argue all the time, most of the time its her fault from what i can tell, sometimes after arguing she gets mad and because i said something that might've supported my dad she will go to the electricity switch of my room, stand in front of it and turn it off, doesn't matter what i say then, she will stay there all night if she has to constantly turning it off.   \nSometimes i try to eat later so i don't have to listen to them argue, and she waits untill the moment i´m eating to enter the kitchen and yell at me over nothing again, it can be the simplest thing like \"the counter is dirty\" a counter which i was gonna clean right after eating, and you'd think oh you should just not react right??  \nIf i react she gets mad   \nif i don't react she gets mad  \nThere's no winning.  \nRecently she started doing this thing where she constantly threatens to call the cops, and have me escorted out.  \nShe says her psychiatrist told her to do it. the problem is my mom is a completely different person when she's around anybody i know for a fact she lies through her teeth about what happens at home.  \nfor example the other day she got mad at me that i had headphones on while i was eating alone so i wouldn't hear her yelling nonstop about why a single spot on the wall is a little dirty, she threatened to cut my headphones with scissors, at one point walking up to me and raising the scissors like she was gonna stab me.  \n(now for context both of my parents have hit me countless times during my childhood one time even breaking my nose) so my instant reflex was to put my arm up to protect myself, while doing that my arm happened to touch her chin.  \nwhat did she do?   \nShe yelled at me and then went on to tell the neighbors that i punched her in the nose, threatening to call the cops.\n\n**My Dad** isn't as bad.   \nHe's just ignorant, he doesn't believe in psychiatry or therapy or mental health at all, he's a person that´s just married to his job, the second my mom starts her thing with yelling about nothing he just leaves the house to go have a drink with his friends, leaving me to deal with her, which is extremely frustrating cause i have no power against her.\n\n  \nA Job\n\nI've obviously struggled with getting a job, when i was younger i jumped into it, had fun at first , then came the existential crisis.\n\nNow a year later my homelife is worse every day at dinner its all yelling, ive gotten more and more depressed to the point where i constantly think about suicide, constantly picture how i would do it, where and how i hope it hits my mother hard that she finally regrets how she treats me for the first time in her life.  \nI've told my parents that im suicidal, so so many times  \nand all they tell me is   \n**Get a job**\n\nIt's like they just see me as a bad investment.   \nYou'd expect a parent to try to support their child to get them financially stable, tell them they'll be fine, help them find something they like.  \nNo their way of making me get a job is by putting my down, constant criticism, daily reminders that i'm useless, i'm a dissappointment, my cousin paid for his parents this and that.  \nThey punish me by turning off the electricity past a certain time, turning off the internet whenever theyre pissed off enough, no matter if im the one actually paying for it.  \nConstantly telling me she's gonna call the cops and have me taken away, hell on one occasion she actually did call the cops and they threatened me that if she says so they can have me removed   \nWhat did i do to warrant that you ask?   \nI was helping my dad cut his hair and while leaving the bathroom some hair fell off me and onto the floor,  \nmy mom immediately started yelling at me to clean it up and as i was having none of it that day i just left closed myself in my room and told her to pick it up if shes gonna yell about it.   \nnext thing i know 3 police officers at my bedroom door. and my mom fake crying at my neighbor.  \nThese are the people i live with , and i'm expected to get a job to support them.   \nI tell them im suicidal they say whatever you do you're the one dealing with consequences, almost brushing it aside.  \nThey tell me even depressed people have jobs that never stopped anyone.\n\nSo tell me am i just lazy?\n\ncause right now i think i'm killing myself before i ever attempt at getting employed again",

        "Text": "My depression comes from my mother who, throughout my life, has had severe depressive episodes. She mainly went from having uncontrollable angry outbursts, becoming physically violent & threatening to off herself to isolating herself in her room & sleeping the entire day. There were moments she was happy & seemed to be doing well, but it would never last & it always hurt me to see a person who could be so sweet struggle so much with their mental health. It got to a point where she wasn't able to care for me anymore & I had also developed severe depression during that time so I was sent to live with my father who didn't have depression, but was waaaay too busy with building his career & would rather spend money on his kids than spend time with them. Growing up, I never had a lot of normal physical or emotional connections with others & developed depression pretty early on, I've had issues with cutting & suicidal ideations. When I was 14 & living with my mother I was sent to 2 different mental institutions for several weeks which didn't help much tbh. \n\nI would say I have high-functioning depression. I can hold down a job, I'm somewhat fiscally responsible, I can take care of myself & my space. Am I where I want to be in my life? No. I feel like my depression is holding me back from building the career I want, pursuing romantic relationships, or just doing hobbies I enjoy. I'm constantly feeling low on energy & mood. I always have to take naps otherwise my brain is foggy or I feel physically sluggish. I struggle with taking my meds & supplements on a regular basis. (I don't go to therapy, but I do see a psychiatrist regularly) Everything just feels like such a struggle. I desperately want to get myself into a better routine (sleep, work, gym, etc.) because there is a lot I want to do with my life & I really want to try out a 60 or 90-day routine challenge, but it sounds so exhausting & I know myself too well where I'll be on track for a few days or a week & then everything goes downhill & I feel like a failure & I have to start back over on day 1.\n\nI'm getting older & I don't want to continue living in this state in my 30's. I will go through a short period where I'm feeling great and on track and something will happen in my head or an external stressor will have me going into a deep depression for a while. It's just so tiring constantly pulling myself out of these depressive episodes & it's so tiring trying to maintain my depression. I can feel the depression affecting my relationship with my family & friends. I'm just starting to think that maybe this is just my life. \n\nA little side note: A couple of years ago, I walked in on an older co-worker trying to off himself at work. He got transported to a hospital, but the scene was graphic & I can't help but think about him & his life & think that maybe this is my future no matter how hard I work at controlling my depression. Lately, my relationships with friends & co-workers have not been great & I'm just really struggling right now. I know I have to make a more concerted effort to get my life back on track & figure out a way to maintain it. If anyone has any suggestions or can relate: I'm open to hearing them. Also, I think taking my meds regularly would help a lot, but I will say that I still get periods of depression and low energy even when I'm on my meds & have been taking them on a regular basis. I've also been thinking lately that maybe I don't have depression & it's something else? ",

I've been diagnosed with OCD, anxiety, depression and an ED. While a lot of this isn't new to me, the OCD has gotten so extremely bad. It feels like my already not great life has been stolen from me, being awake is pure torture from my own brain and intrusive thoughts. I was suppose to write my master thesis this autumn, but I can't even get out of bed most days. The rest of my time is spent obsessively showering, washing hands and cleaning. I'm just so tired and can't do this anymore. I fight my own brain every second of the day and night.\n\nMy family situation is bad, and my long term relationship ended earlier this autumn (while very very sad, it was mutual due to different wishes for the future). So this year I'm gonna spend christmas alone, and I already think about jumping from one of the city bridges on christmas eve. I just feel so hopeless, and tired of everything. \n\nI'm sorry for my venting/rant, I just felt a sort of need to be heard I suppose.

It still hurts but all i know is depression tells us lies like we’re worthless, hopeless, and useless when it’s not true. it makes us believe that something bad happened to us but nothing bad happened. It alters us and the way we think believe and behave. Everyone experiences depression in their own way but the one thing we can know that’s true is that it lies to us and we are much better than those lies, just living is enough. \nAnxiety, and panic attacks are hard in it of its self but I tell myself it’s just a reaction to our mental state, environment and other things. Our bodies are just sensitive and it’s a hidden battle not everyone experiences, but those who understand you probably feel alone but there is people like me and a lot of others who commonly experience these feelings and I just wanted to validate anyone who feels lost, hopeless, and feeling too broken to keep going. You may not be able to control depression and it’s involuntary mess, but you are more than your emotions, you are more than just feelings. ",

I have held myself together the best I could my entire life but after my 30th... I have always kept a smile on my face even when I'm not happy which has been most of my life, thinking things will get better when they never do but on my birthday I finally broke down. I'm a 30M who has never had a girlfriend, never been on a date, and never had friends. I was bullied a lot in my younger years causing me to have physical, mental, and emotional scares, none of which are selp inflicted. Examples of things I went through are being called names, getting beat up till I was bloody and brused, stabbed, and told to kill myself. I keped pushing though all that working hard in school and trying to make friends. I had teachers who said I would never achieve anything. I graduated college and paid off all my debt. I was not able to make friends in college no matter how hard I tried. I now have a well paying job but none of my coworkers want to do anything outside of work with me. I can't afford a place of my own so I live with my parents who can be mentally and emotionally abusive. My dad blames me for everything. Something in the house breaks or something does not go his way it is my fault. He always speaks fondly of my two older sisters but just tells me how much of a failure I am. My mom is always on me about not being married and having kids. I would love to have a girl in my life who I love and she loves me but getting nagged about it daily just makes me feel like a failure not being able to even get a date. I look decent I think. I'm 6' 6\" tall, 270 lbs but looks like I weigh less because my broad sholders. I have good hygiene. I wear a lot of button up plad shirts. So maybe it is my wardrobe. Some of my hobbies include hiking, fishing, swimming, drawing, videogames, and anime. I have been on multiple dating apps sense I turned 21 without ever getting a match. Just thought thing would be better in my life by now. After my 30th birthday I have not been able to smile or think anything positive about myself. All I can think about is how ugly I must be, how big of a failure I am, how worthless I am, and other dark thoughts about myself. I have not been able to do my hobbies. They no longer help me fill less alone. I just want to know what it feels like to be romantically loved, and what it feels like to be hugged by that person but I now know that will never happen because I am not deserving of love and care. Anyone have any advice to improve things? How to meet people? I'm sick of being alone and unlove.",

I don't even care about being caught. I'm a fucking adult worst comes to worst I can just dissapear and do whatever. \n\nIf the drugs are going to make things easier, what's the problem? Yeah I know addiction fucking sucks but I don't want to live long enough for it to matter. I damage my health? It either kills me or I do it myself. I get something laced? Might take me out. If I had the guts to do it without the risk of failing and being sectioned or found by family again, I'd do it. \n\nThe thing is I'm not stupid. I know not everything is bad and I can have good times but it's not even worth it anymore because it always gets worse again. I absolutely love the good times, I've made some amazing memories but no one understands how horrible the lows are, they make it feel like it's not worth the highs. And the highs might not even be real, maybe it's just the BPD tricking me into feeling better than it really is. \n\nI know I'd make people sad if I died but they'd get over it. And I imagine they'd have some relief too because they wouldn't have to worry about me anymore. I wouldn't always be the one who gets quiet and sad randomly, the one who is always admitting to cutting again or doing something stupid. People say you're not a burden even when they are because they don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt people and maybe me being here is hurting people. \n\nI don't feel loveable. I don't feel worthy of anything. I don't feel like a good person. \n\nI've tried so hard too. People don't understand that, they say don't give up, there's better things to come. Try living what I've lived. And yeah, other people have it worse. I'm lucky in many respects. But at the same time I'm still in pain. I am in so much pain and I'm not as strong as other people, I don't want to be in pain anymore. I don't remember the last time I was able to be happy without the fear and impending doom of the next dip right around the corner. \n\nI'm not going to kill myself. Not now anyway. I'm not a danger to my life. Because I can't risk getting caught and sectioned again if I fail. But I'm not taking care of my safety, I'll take risks and I'll make stupid unsafe decisions because it doesn't matter to me if I semi accidentally take myself out. At least then the illusion of it being a complete accident might take the pain of it being suicidal away from the people who for whatever stupid reason say they care. But hey, I'm just not that lucky am I. I'm like a fucking parasite, I survive anything when all I really want is my stupid actions to finish me because I can't do it myself. God I'm pathetic. ",

Then she asked me if I was familiar with any of it and for some reason I felt like telling her my whole story with inpatient stays etc. I've really come clean but now I feel weird about it. I know that she noticed something off about me before but she's always been really nice and inclusive to me. I've also mentioned a suspected autism and she told me that she can imagine me being \"on the spectrum\" which I feel really weird about.\nWe ended the talk on good terms and I am grateful that I have someone to open up to. Nevertheless I feel really weird and that I shared my story in a messy way and I am worried about what she might think of me now and how this is going to change our relationship.

I finally found a guy that treats me well and seems like my perfect match. I’m now preparing for a wedding again but I don’t feel as happy as I did last time and I can’t figure out why. What am I missing?",

A few months ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD and Ive been on medicine both, and honestly I think so many changes in my meds were the start of all this. I started to feel a little depressed a few months ago. I didn't think anything of it, but lately it's been more severe to the point where my friends and mom are all telling me I'm likely depressed, and after explanations Ive heard from them, I think I agree. I don't have suicidal thoughts, I do not want to die, but sometimes it's hard to see the point of living. It feels like there's nothing going on, and nothing in store for my future. I can't make myself feel things sometimes, which is terrifying to me because I am normally someone who feels strongly. I'm only 15, I'll be 16 next month, and I'm scared for my future because at a recent appointment with my pediatrician I found out there's a history of depression in my family. I don't know what the point of this post is really. I don't think this is severe depression or anything, and calling it depression even feels like pushing it, but this has been hard for me.\n\nI appreciate having a space to share things like this :) I don't want to put this on the people in my life who aren't equipped to deal with it. Thank you, reddit ",

I just had so much energy and trust me it's not because I got enough sleep because I went to sleep 4 hours after my usual bed time last night. Is my brain just done feeling sad so it blocks it off completely? I deadass feel okay and happy rn like I have no problems in life... Am I going crazy??? I am near my period and I do get mood swings but one singular mood never lasts a full school day. Is this gonna wear off later today and I'll feel like I usually do again?

I'm struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about ten years. Two time suicide attempts. But somehow I always fought my way back and had some kind of hope that it would get better. But the horror of having your physical appearance change involuntary and there is nothing you can do about it! This is on a whole new level. I could live with depression and suicidal thoughts before, because after weeks of deep depression it got better for a few days. But living in complete horror for the last two years?! Everyday I get up and I don't recognize my face in the mirror. At least at days of depression, I still had the ability to leave the house or smile. But know my physical appearance denies me of social relations, leaving the house, seeking help. Nobody understands and nobody knows. Its absolutely horrible to live in this reality. All I can thing of: Why did this have to happened to me? How is this fair? I want to be happy like most people out there just living their life. ",

You fucking explain everything to them, all that's happened in your life, how you feel from the moment you wake up, to the moment you fall asleep. You want to do good in your life. Be the best person you can be. But......you just can't. It doesn't make any sense. Like I'm sorry bro, I didn't choose to fucking loathe life at the age of 24. I didn't choose to sacrifice so much. People really lack basic fucking empathy. And as lonely as I feel in life. I'm getting really tired of dealing with people and trying my hardest to just let shit go. Do you just cut people off like this?. I've cut my own useless dad out of my life. Why do I try with others?. ",

I feel like I’m trapped in a storm that never ends, where hope flickers only to be extinguished before I can grasp it.\n\nThere are days when I look at myself and wonder if I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not good enough, or maybe I just wasn’t meant to succeed. These thoughts consume me, and it’s hard to silence them. I feel weighed down by sadness, and yet, I keep trying because a small part of me still believes things can get better, even if I don’t know how or when.\n\nI struggle to open up about this because I fear being judged or misunderstood. People tell me to stay positive, but they don’t see how hard it is when everything feels so heavy. I want to believe in better days, but right now, I’m just tired—tired of pretending to be okay, tired of fighting battles I always seem to lose, and tired of feeling like I’m stuck in a life where nothing ever goes my way.\n\nI wish I could find the strength to break free from this, to rewrite my story, and to finally feel like I’m not just surviving but living.

I can’t go to my family since they have never understood my mental health nor have they ever supported me through it they only made it worse. I also really hate people sympathising me because of trauma of my mum pretending she really cared for me infront of other people but treating me like I was nothing behind everyone’s back so that contributes to my problem of getting help. \nI’ve questioned if I was autistic, but whether I do or not doesn’t fix my struggle of maintaining friendships, having the energy to care for anything. \nI tried antidepressants and they only made me more suicidal so I stopped.\nI’m 22, I havnt got my life sorted, i dont know what to do, the pressure of having to move out, get a job, find friends, new relationships is way too much when I literally can’t get myself to leave my house because of my depression.

I've always been fairly introverted, so that probably plays a role. but, last year, i stopped talking to pretty much anyone that was my friend. they were mostly \"friends of convenience\" since we all worked together. any time i would want to do something...hell no. \n\n3: My sleeping habits suck. i get sleep, but it rarely ever feels \"restful\". i don't drink or take any form of drugs other than an occasional unisom if i just toss and turn for hours. more often than i care to admit, i just want to sleep. i don't want to talk to anyone. i don't want to do anything. just sleep. \n\nfor clarity, i've never wanted to harm myself or others. and i was on lexipro or whatever it's called for a few months about 3 years ago. i did not notice a change and didn't pursue it further.",
