I know so many people struggled during that time but for me it was the first time I was able to focus on myself. I think being forced to not have much to do with my family helped me out a lot. \n\nEven when my ed was at its worst, I was never one to really get triggered by others. But I think now I’m a healthy weight and it seems so many celebs are very thin all of a sudden, it’s really triggering me. I’m trying my best not to restrict and over exercise but I’ve noticed I’ve been focusing more on cardio than weight training again to lose a little weight. It’s like there is this huge argument in my head constantly at the moment, one part of me is screaming to just slim down a little and the other is telling me that this is just the beginning of a relapse. I can’t seem to escape all these images of celebs, especially Ariana at the moment and I think it’s what has triggered this thinking. Or is this just a normal part of recovering from an ed? Anyone else feeling extremely triggered too? \n\nI feel so stupid for thinking I was over my eating disorder. I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to let anyone know I’m struggling because they’ll all be so disappointed in me. All anyone does is say how proud they are of me for coming so far and how amazing it is they never have to worry about me anymore. I don’t want to let anyone down but I’m really struggling with these thoughts. ",

Whether it’s texture, smell or color I have a hard time trying new food or liking enough safe foods to have a healthy diet. I have struggled with this since childhood. \n\nHowever I had found my safe foods and ate the same things at the same time every single day until I was diagnosed with LADA. A form of  slow progressive type 1 diabetes in adults. Now food became my biggest stress. Instead of trying new healthy foods I learned no food = no high blood sugars. I was praised by my endo for having such amazing A1C’s until the weight flew off. I lost enough weight that it became apparent I wasn’t eating and I couldn’t fool my doctor anymore. I admitted to everything and was set up with a ton of resources. \n\nI did really well for the past 3 years but unfortunately my disease has progressed and I am at the point of needing mealtime insulin. I already am catching myself restricting food in the hopes of postponing the inevitable. It’s so hard to have a disease that depends on food so much. My relationship with food has always been unhealthy but now every single aspect of my life is controlled by it. What I can eat, when and how much and if I don’t I get really sick. I have already passed out multiple times from hypoglycemia. I’m truly scared of this disease and whether or not I’m strong enough to overcome it. \n\nI’m just looking for anyone who has encouragement , advice or has been through a similar situation as me. Thank you for reading my story any feedback is appreciated ",

The biggest issue, specially with my step dad is I was somehow eating wrong, other than that, dinner was just a judge JWolf thing. My mom always went to stop him but eventually, eating at the table in my house has been abolished since I was 15. We eat infringement of the tv because it got to the point where I would stop eating during the day all together. Then it turned to me hoarding food in my room or only eating at night. \n\nI have eaten in restaurants and I like food but I am slow and as soon as everyone stops eating, so do I. If I have supper at a friend's place I eat the bare minimum then get super hungry and eat later in the evening. Most of the time I won't eat all day until like 10 pm. I know this is an issue. I also hate cooking and I especially hate cooking when other people can see me do it. Makes me anxious.\n\nNow, over the past months it's kinda gotten worse because now I get anxious getting food infringement of anyone. I do sometimes binge when I do eat, or I'll one litterally meal at night for the entire day. \n\nDon't get me wrong here, I LOVE food. I eating is stasfying. I'm also AuDHD so texture is huge with food for me. \n\nThis has been going on for 7/8 years and it is getting progressively worse. My energy is tanking and so is my health.\n\nSo, to sum it up. I like food. I hate cooking or getting food in front of other people. I struggle eating infront of other people. I definitely struggle eating at tables or other people see me eat. I now find shopping for myself anxiety inducing. I sometimes binge if I'm really hungry but I just don't eat enough on the regular and I know it.\n\nIt's not about weight or anything and I feel stupid that any of this is a problem. I even noticed the the majority of my meals in restaurants come home woth me and I eat it as soon as everyone is asleep.\n\nMy friend and mom think it's just a fear of being perceived. I am kinda proud though because I know for years this was an issue. More so now that I'm an adult and people can't make me do anything. \n\nI told my best friend first a few days ago. The realization that I would decline if given an option for food but would reluctantly eat it if I wasn't. So...basically she's kind of awesome and will just put food in front of me, put on a show and not look at or talk to me til I've eaten. She got really upset cause I was driving home from her place, we were on the phone so she new I got there ok (it was 12 am). I mentioned I was going to make something to eat cause I was starving and hadn't eat all day.  She told me I should have told her and she would have got me something. Thus me explaining the situation. The next day she took me to the store to find things that have the nutrition I need but minimal actual prep and cooking.\n\nI told my mom a day later just cause I thought she should know. I also wanted her with when I go to the Dr because she articulates the origin better. She usually assumes I can take care of my self cause work and school (it's just cheaper rn to live all together and split costs) but she asked me if I ate dinner and I said no, then she made me get something. I took a bowl into the garage to my own fridge (I can't have gluten so I have my own fridge) got some yogurt and granola woth berries and ate in my room.\n\nsorry about the last couple paragraphs, I just figured it was good to know I had a support system of some kind",

As teens we often got asked “are you sure you want a second helping? I put on weight at your age” etc. \n\nThe comments aimed directly at us have stopped, but those about the content of the food have not - “I made it with fat-free cream”, “oh no it’s too sugary”, “this isn’t good quality” or “not for me it’s too rich”. My cousin came out with anorexia last year (has been suffering for 10+ years) and asked for those comments to stop for obvious reasons.  \n\nUnfortunately the issue is too deep-seated: they don’t see their relationship with food and weight as problematic (no problem in a 60+ year-old, slim woman in perfect health envying her 30-year-old daughter’s smaller waist right?), so their comments don’t stop because they’re not aimed at us, they’re all about “being healthy”. Similarly, they’d never admit to any body dysmorphia, they’d just say “I want to feel healthy”. \n\nI want to find books to suggest to them that might open their eyes, whether about orthorexia (I don’t think they’re at that point but there’s a whiff of it) or general toxicity around food in society and families. \n\nWorth noting they never diet so those books wouldn’t hit the mark.

        "Text": "\nI had a friend once tell me this when she was months deep into an eating disorder. I had done everything I could to be there for her while protecting my own recovery - when her ED began and she came to me, I gave her all the best loving insight I could that she asked for. It was brand new for her and I had already been navigating one for ~10 years. We had a beautiful like 2 hour long mutually vulnerable conversation sitting on the stairs and got even closer (we were already besties at that point). Time went on and her ED progressed, and honestly she’d talk about calorie restriction on her social media stories etc which was harmful to myself and I’m sure others. There were other things throughout this friendship led to us not lasting as friends - we’re very different people and both saw that. \n\nBut towards the end she told me she had partly taken space on her end because, in her words, “you’re a massive trigger for me”. I had only ever shown her so much love and space to talk about her own experiences. I’ve had and found many friends through this struggle and it’s never led to anything but a stronger bond and healthy support of each other. And I was not feeling like in a competitive place with my ED at that time/was actually in a pretty healthy place and didn’t even really talk about it. So it truly felt like just my existence was the trigger, and that’s basically how she worded it. This comment was honestly just dehumanizing. It made me feel like my friend who I loved just looked at me like I’m part of The Problem, like I’m an anonymous thinspo post that should be banned from the light, and not a human being like her also hurting with my own problems. I can respect if she didn’t have the strength to be around me without comparing us at that time and therefore needed space, but the way she chose to say that was so hurtful. She didn’t even say she understands it’s not my fault or anything.. just said that and left it hanging as if I’m supposed to fix something about it. \n\nI had another best friend once with a serious ED for years like myself, at the same time, and she was almost always much thinner than I. I truly never could imagine saying that to her even if I were feeling insecure about it, which of course I sometimes did. :( idk. I’m just curious if anyone can relate. This made me feel really shitty about myself and sometimes ashamed to show my body now online, but it’s my body and I deserve to. \n\nTLDR: friend I was trying to lovingly support through an ED got competitive and told me that I (me myself) am one of her biggest triggers because of my appearance and it was hurtful.

I (25F) was naturally quite skinny for most of my life until about 2020. I would say I hit my highest weight in early 2023 and now weigh quite a bit less. I’ve lost a lot of weight in the last year without trying to, and my doctors haven’t been able to find any medical reason for it.\n\nHowever, this rapid weight loss has now led me to try to lose even more. The way my body looks, how small my waist, arms, and thighs are, have completely taken over my consciousness. I think about it all day. It hasn’t led me to starve myself completely, but I’ve definitely been restricting more, cutting out certain foods, and intentionally skipping meals especially on days when I don’t exercise. The thing is, I LOOK like a perfectly healthy, active 25 year old woman, so I don’t think anyone would notice.\n\nI’ve been talking with my therapist (who happens to specialize in EDs) about this, and she’s done everything but formally diagnose me (she keeps saying things like “I’m not diagnosing you, but…”). The other day, I flat out told her that I don’t see myself stopping these behaviors until it becomes a serious issue. She talked to me about harm reduction. But this realization was the most honest I’ve been with myself this whole time- I feel like I will not stop trying to lose weight until I’m either very sick, it’s noticeable to other people, or both.\n\nCan anyone tell me if this is normal?

It’s been very severe at points and led to many rehab visits and hospitalizations. My eating disorder was fine for a while, but the past few months it got really bad again. I’m restricting, purging, and overexercising daily. Things were very bad when I was younger, but this time around is so different. I’m losing nearly a pound a day and I feel sick all the time. I acknowledge that what I’m doing to my body is harmful and that I need help, but help is inaccessible  to me. I tried to start seeing a dietitian, but my insurance won’t cover sessions for an eating disorder unless I have anorexia or bulimia. I don’t meet the clinical criteria for either. I’m not sick enough for them. I can get inpatient or residential treatment covered, but I can not afford to pay our mortgage while I am away. My partner would very likely be unable to pay my share so I can get help. I don’t have family that would be willing to help me. My parents have money but they have an attitude of “you’re an adult, figure it out.” I just feel so desperate. I’m deteriorating mentally and physically, but I don’t have the resources to get help or the will to get better on my own. I honestly don’t know when I’ll be able to afford help and that’s terrifying. I feel really hopeless and I don’t know what to do next. I’ve never needed a higher level of care as an adult until now.

Some of their family has eating problems too so I didn't think that this would really be a problem in our relationship but it's been proving different. They were really loving and understanding and supportive when I was at my worst but it seems that whenever I get somewhat better they assume that I don't still struggle. I've been able to eat atleast two meals daily for the last few months which is leagues better than what I used to be, but they honestly get upset whenever I don't meet that quota for the day. The real breaking point for me was when we had an argument close to bedtime and I told them that I was hungry but had no appetite. They got really angry and gave me the silent treatment, when they did talk they had a short tempered tone. I told them that I was going to brush my teeth and I wouldn't eat again until the morning and they just replied \"you are eating tonight\". When I returned to the room I got back into bed and they asked me if I would eat which I responded to with \"no, I already brushed my teeth and I can eat tomorrow\", my partner replied to this with a grunt and a punch to the wall. I just decided to quiet down for the rest of the night, they occasionally asked if I would eat which was followed by more annoyed grunts and sighs. After about 30 minutes of this they asked why I wouldn't eat and I was honestly so tired and I said \"because I have an eating disorder, please stop. I've told you this doesn't help. You're upset because you're worried about me and this isn't anyway of going over this.\". They stayed silent for about two minutes then replied \"just make yourself eat.\". I didn't reply and they went downstairs for a bit because I asked them to cool off. When they returned they had a bowl of apple slices and placed it down next to me on the bed. After I refused to eat they said \"do I have to force you to eat?\". We ended the night poorly and I didn't eat. I don't know what to do or how to help them understand that I physically cannot eat sometimes. Does anyone have some advice?",

I knew he was eating a lot at night after I go to bed, but clearly he’s eating a lot more than I realized. It’s not just snacks, it’s everything: bags of veggies, frozen fruit, leftovers, uncooked ramen, whatever he can find that’s edible he will eat. He can go thru a 12 pack of soda in a night. I can’t keep up with making sure there’s enough food in the house. This morning when I got up, there was food and garbage everywhere so I got him up and asked him to clean his mess. I told his social worker, but she doesn’t have any advice or resources right now and is more concerned about other behaviors (can of worms). I’m not in any way saying I can replace clinical or medical care, but until his social worker can help me find resources, what can I do to help? ",

Like, if I’m feeling hungry at 5pm but I usually eat dinner at 6, is it okay if I wait a whole hour to eat? Or that would just perpetuate the hunger? \n\n2. Do I have to eat what I crave when I crave it? I find that I only want to eat carbs, cookies and cheese. Although I know I should honor this cravings, I’m a little worried of the implications of eating a huge amount of this kind of food could have on my body (not necessarily on my weight but in my health)\n\n3. Should I honor mental hunger as well? There are times when I don’t really feel hungry but I can’t stop thinking about food. Should I eat the food I can’t get out of my head then? Even if I don’t feel physically hungry? This makes me a little worried because what if it becomes a habit and I just can’t stop eating? \n\nI’m really trying to keep an open mind throughout this whole process but I feel extremely out of control… :p",

Were you at a healthy weight or UW when these consequences happened?  \n\nI have been for a month trying to recover but keep giving up as I am borderline OW and I am so scared of gaining more. I do not trust myself as an intuive eater as my hunger these past 2 weeks (in my recovery attempt) was crazyyyyyy I gained so much already ( OW category now). \n\nSo anyway, I relapsed yesterday. Also, I feel like I won't really hurt myself if I go back to restricting ( again) as I am almost overweight so I can afford to lose weight very quickly.\n\nI am kind of trying to scare myself into recovery but yeah, would love to here y'alls answers from these questions above. \n\nThank you!

But as I grew into a teenager and adult I never really grew out of it. And it became much more uncomfortable for me to eat. If the smell, texture or colour was even a little off, it is very hard for me to get it down without gagging. Now, I hate eating, and I wish I didn't have to at all. There is very little I enjoy, and the little I do has very little nutritional value.\n\nI always just thought I was a picky eater, but it's gotten to the point where eating is just awful. I have researched a bit on avoidant eating disorders, and I really see myself in a lot of it. But I am weary of diagnosing myself with something when I could just be over-exaggerating my picky eating tendencies. I've never seen anyone talk about eating disorders outside of weight or connections to other mental disorders, so I'm quite confused.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of eating disorder? How did you know? What helps? Thank you :))",

He loves it and wants to take every chance he gets to get something there as well as share this newfound treasure with me, which is very sweet, pun intended.\n\nI didn't have a proper eating disorder diagnosis, but I did have very container binges plus a phobia of hunger from childhood which was retriggered by a diet I did a few years ago and which I'm still struggling with. I also have a health condition due to which it would be best to limit my sugar intake.\n\nCurrently I'm in therapy for my food related behaviour and anxiety and we're concentrating on me regaining agency in the food area. I need to make food decisions freely and I should eat what I want to eat, whether I want it because I'm hungry, I want it because *I*, not a doctor an influencer my mother, thinks it's healthier for me, I want it because it just feels good.\n\nThis bakery obsession of my boyfriend is seriously distressing for me. I want to be able to enjoy some bakery treats with him, but I feel like that takes away from my ability to fully decide for myself and it worries me because I know I will still eat the sugary things I want ON TOP of what I eat with my boyfriend.\n\nHe already brought a third of a lemon loaf (my favourite cake) over once and I basically ate it nearly all at once because I couldn't stand the stress it caused me. He brought me some strawberry jam they make because he tasted a pastry that included it and he thought the jam was awesome and he even told me \"like this you can eat it when YOU want\" because he's very much aware of what I'm doing with my therapist and where I'm at, which makes me struggle even more.\n\nIt's an entirely legitimate thing to want to have breakfast with your partner at your favourite bakery, or pick something up there together to eat after a home made lunch, but right now I feel like this very normal desire of his is incompatible with how I feel and I feel bad because, when I eventually end up telling him, he will understand but he will be very sad too.\n\nLike, today I already had a sweet breakfast, I have no desire for a pastry or a piece of cake. But he really wants to get something from there FOR ME because he's so stoked he wants me to try it.\n\nI don't know how not to break his heart on this, he already listens to me about this so often, takes care of me when I'm mentally unwell, I was also physically unwell for months this year which meant zero eating out. This seems like just a normal little thing, but I can't do it if it's at the expense of my own wellbeing, but I'm so sad to have to disappoint him.",

I don’t have an appetite, and I feel like I’m watching myself physically fade away. The changes are so noticeable that I can’t ignore them, and they’re starting to concern others as well. It’s frightening to feel this lack of control over my own body, especially when my reflection now feels like a reminder of how much I’m struggling inside.\n\nAs a musician, creating used to be an outlet for me—a way to express emotions that words couldn’t capture. But now, depression tells me, “What’s the point?” Even activities I know are helpful feel distant and hard to reach in this state. The emptiness and hopelessness are overwhelming, and the weight loss has become a visible marker of my inner struggle.\n\nRecently, I started a low-dose ketamine treatment, which has been a small glimmer of hope. I’ve tried nearly every antidepressant, and therapy used to help when I had a therapist who understood me. Unfortunately, he’s no longer available, and my new therapist hasn’t been able to provide the same guidance—it feels more like venting without direction. I also had some struggles with my current clinic, where a nurse practitioner dismissed my long-standing medications without much consideration.\n\nWhen my wife found out about the ketamine treatment, things became difficult. She’s in recovery, so it’s hard for her to see ketamine as anything but a “recreational drug.” I didn’t tell her initially because I anticipated her reaction and because finances are tight. I’ve cut out all non-essential spending to afford this treatment, but she still sees it as selfish.\n\nI understand her concerns, but I’m desperate to find something that works. I feel like I’m running out of options. The physical changes are terrifying, and every time I look in the mirror, I feel like I’m watching myself disappear. For me, this isn’t about “drugs” or money—it’s about trying to survive and find some stability. I feel like I’m drowning, and her support would mean so much.\n\nI don’t have anyone else to lean on, and I think she doesn’t realize how much I depend on her. I’m also wondering if anyone else has gone through similar experiences with unintentional weight loss and a lack of appetite while dealing with depression. I’m feeling lost and just trying to find a way out of this.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar or just wants to offer some words of support, I’d be so grateful. Right now, I really need to hear something positive and hopeful.\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this and can offer some support or insight.\n",

She has been teased since she started school at 4 (she’s a March baby and we’re in Australia), and her weight has always been a subject to come up. Keep in mind that she was a really active kid and wasn’t ever overweight. Our parents let us do two sports a year, and she did swimming for about four years and Judo up until last. The bullying this year got worse (this kid and his friends would call her a ‘fat pig’ on the daily and make fun of her for eating at school. she didn’t tell us this until it was too late and she attempted.) she’s also diagnosed with autism type two, anxiety, and we are in the process of getting a diagnosis for ADHD. I say this because I have 0 experience at all with EDs and I’m not sure if this is all relevant? She has a hyperfixation on cats, if that could maybe help us?\n\nShe was diagnosed with anorexia this year (she keeps denying that she has it but it has been professionally diagnosed and she’s seeing a dietitian each week. She also has a paediatrician, a psychologist and a family therapist and I think a few other doctors she sees regularly, but those three are the main ones.) We’ve been trying to help her eat, but she won’t eat at all during the day, especially at school, consciously checks carbs on everything we give her and eats loads smaller portions than she normally would. Like, she’d typically have two maybe three bowls of pasta and now can barely finish her first. We’ve been making her breakfast (usually none of us eat breakfast) and she’s been appointed with her favourite teacher to watch her eat at lunch times. I just genuinely do not know how to help her. I really need advice because it’s breaking my heart and I’m so scared to lose her.\n\nPlease, please, I really need advice if anybody has been in my position or my sisters. Do I encourage her to eat? Do I let her slowly starve herself? I really need help.",

I got my eating disorder when I was 12, and Id like to say I didn’t fully recover until 15, after hospitalizations and inpatient . I’m now 18, and the last 3 years have been fairly good. I have had the occasional restriction thoughts, but almost considered myself fully recovered until 3 months ago.\n \nI was at my pediatrician , and she had me download an app to schedule appointments, however I found a tab with all my weight charts. I have been doing blind weights since 13, so this was extremely triggering. I saw that I gained 22 pounds in the last 3 years, and totally freaked out. \n\nI’m aware that i’m a growing teenager, and that it is unrealistic for me to stay at a weight I was when I was fifteen,\nhowever it really triggered me , and ed is not logical. \n\nI just don’t understand how I trusted my body and ate intuitively and gained weight, If i hadn’t found out , would I have kept gaining weight . When would it end. That’s what triggered my relapse. The last 3 months I have been undereating and over excersising in order to return to the weight I was, I’m not weighing myself but I’m sure i’m there if not lower. I don’t know what to do now, I’m so hungry all the time and i’m scared to return to normal eating because I’ve seen all over timtok that if you don’t slowly increase your calories in 6-8 weeks you will gain all your weight back, not only is it terryfying for me to increase my low intake, but i’m scared for when I reach a normal amount of food. Is my body now adapted to low calories and will make me gain weight, or will I be okay. How can I trust I won’t gain all of it back.\n\nI also don’t want to gain weight before my mom comes home because I want her to see i’m sick again in a weird way, she’s out the country and will be back in 2 weeks. \nPlease give feedback/advice.

        "Text": "This post is very UK specific as it relates to UK law and UK inpatient practices and i know Reddit is very US centric so I'm not sure if I'll get an answer but I wanted to try anyway.\n\n\nI know from taking to people online that if you go inpatient they will not allow you to adhere to a plant based diet. They see it as another form of control over food. This might be out of date info though as these conversations were had several years ago and the relevant tribunal ruling was fairly recent. If anyone has any recent experience I'd be interested to hear about it.\n\n\nMy veganism predates my ED by several years. I'm also fully vegan rather than just eating plant based, meaning all my makeup, toiletries, cleaning products etc are free of animal testing and animal derived ingredients. My point here is, unlike a plant based diet, veganism is something that is applied to every aspect of life, not just food. So I find it hard to accept that my veganism wouldn't be accommodated if I went inpatient as it is clearly not centred around food control.\n\n\nA tribunal also found veganism to meet the criteria necessary to be recognised as a philosophical belief, meaning vegans are protected under the Equality Act 2010 in the same way religious beliefs are protected. It would be illegal for an inpatient program to decide a Muslim was refusing to eat pork in order to maintain control and try to force them to eat it, so surely since veganism is protected under the same laws shouldn't refusal to accommodate veganism be illegal too? I can understand how they can refuse to allow someone to maintain a plant based diet because that doesn't really meet the criteria for a philosophical belief as it only relates to food. But veganism has been ruled to qualify.\n\n\nObviously this question stems from concern about my own personal situation. If I ever needed to go inpatient but they refused to accommodate my veganism I would not be able to receive necessary treatment and that really scares me. ",

She yells out of her lungs like a total psycho 24/7, her screams are so deafening that I am surprised that police hasn't showed up at our house yet. She is the classic textbook crazy person. TOTALLY crazy and out of her mind. She runs with knives on her hands threatening to kill herself (just for show, she's been doing this for ages).She need constant presence from my mother to do everything,she is worse than a child. She need to repeat what she ate FOR HOURS, screaming. Me and my family are living in pure terror and in a pure nightmare ever since. My parents always supported my sister, they praised her always, they did EVERYTHING for her. They were super loving and present,and they still are. I cannot convince my mother to take serious action to stop this whole situation. I suffer so fucking much in seeing my parents in so much pain and despair. They are old and tired. She manipulate them, she lies, she steals, she plays the victim!! She know that she is satan on earth and yet she plays the victim every day. She cannot take one single responsibility. She doesn't have her license yet so she goes to work thanks to my mom always carrying her around and in public she is perfectly normal and nice! She doesn't want psychiatric help. My life is a hell because of her. My mom cries EVERY NIGHT to sleep. I am thinking about calling the police while she is having another breakdown. But my parents don't want to because it would be a shame. I am totally trapped and powerless. I am from Italy and I don't have the means to live by myself financially yet. Please. If you have a suggestion, I will thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

        "Text": "Hi! This may be an odd question but I’ve tried googling it a few times and never managed to find any proper answers.\n\nI used to be absolutely fine with drinking alcohol, I would get drunk as normal and then it would fade away later on. No nausea, no throwing up, no headaches, hot flashes etc.\n\nThen I developed an ed, it started out as anorexia for a year which then developed into a nasty case of bulimia that went on for roughly three years I think? Anyways, it was so bad that I ended up dropping out of school because it completely consumed my entire existence and had to call 111 because I started having a dodgy heart. \n\nLuckily, I’m recovered and have been since January 2024! Only times I’ll ever force myself to be sick is if I’m nauseous and it won’t come out itself. I’ve noticed a few long term side effects such as no longer being able to drink tea on an empty stomach, an extremely weak gag reflex, bloating more often and of course, the lack of period. But the biggest thing I’ve noticed is my awful alcohol tolerance now. I get drunk far faster than other people and almost EVERY time my night ends in me throwing up, my face turning red from how hot I get, bloating and light headaches. \n\nIs this linked to my past with purging? I never used to experience any of this but now, throwing up when drinking is pretty much 100% certain now and I just can’t take it like I used to. Again, google was useless with helping me find an answer, so I’d be immensely appreciative if somebody could help :)\n\nSide note, the doctors did suspect that I caused permanent damage in my body but I refused to ever come in for an examination because I was still so self conscious in regards to my weight. So I never found out 🤷‍♀️",

I also work full time and am not always home to even know that she eats all the time.\nHer father’s family are not small people (history of diabetes and heart disease as well as obesity) and she is built just like them. Her weight is not a concern right now, but I foresee health issues if she continues this pattern as she is also not into sports and, therefore, not consistently active (but not a couch potato either.) She carries some additional weight, but nothing medically concerning at this time.\nHer older sister and I don’t have the same struggle with weight due to genetics, nothing more. Older sister has experienced disordered eating and I have run the gamut between food addiction and restriction. \nNow that you have context, how do I encourage better eating WITHOUT directly addressing anything that would be triggering? We’ve had conversations about how to EAT as opposed to how to diet, but it goes in one ear and out the other.\nTo be clear, my primary concern is her developing habits with food that are harmful to her later. Especially because I am just now, at 45, learning that food is neutral. I don’t want her to have the same struggles I’ve experienced.\nThis feels more like a vent than a plea for advice, but I don’t really know where to turn. I KNOW she needs to be fueling her body with something other than spaghettios, Nutella, and ramen, but I refuse to comment on her weight or her body. I also won’t make her feel guilt for anything she puts in her mouth. This is a hill I will die on.\nAnd no, we don’t eat meals at the table as no one is ever home at the same time. I do cook, but half the time she chooses something else and it’s when I’m still at work or when she gets home from one of her time intensive extracurriculars (or her dad buys her fast food.)\nY’all, I’m just trying to be a good mom who looks out for her kid, but doesn’t cause shame.

        "Text": "My(18 gn for privacy)  partner(17, gn for privacy) has acknowledged the fact that he has a problem with eating and we're trying to research different disorders to find ways to help him cope. (I'm writing for him because he doesn't speak English well enough to write a full post like this) myself have an ED (my diagnosis is unspecified and just says \"eating disorder\" put my experience lines up best with bulimia and a little with anorexia) but I obviously don't know everything there is. I know a little about orthorexia (sorry if I spelled it wrong) and AFRID but that's it. \n\nTheir experience with food is really complicated. They're mainly afraid to eat because they're scared that the food or the appliances are dirty. It's mainly their scared about the cleanliness of things. They don't avoid food because of thier body image at all and have said that it doesn't affect them. They grew up lower class and it wasn't always certain if they'd have food they could comfortably eat. They very heavily dislike meat and avoid eating it almost always, but their parents are really insistent that people eat meat, whenever they decline the food with meat that they offer their parents get very pushy and aggressive saying things like \"why won't you eat it?\" \"You don't eat enough meat\" \"you need to eat meat\" \"just eat it already\" and stuff like that. They feel everything their parents touch is dirty because they have habits like sneezing into a paper and wiping thr counter with the same paper, or cutting raw meat with a knife and only rinsing the knife with water and then putting it back,(for context: they hand wash all their dishes in their family) or washing dishes with just water and whatever soap is left in the sponge instead of just adding more soap. So usually all the \"clean\" dishes feel oily and dirty. They usually feel too tired to make anything because just making a simple meal means they would first have to wash everything thoroughly because they don't know what's genuinely clean and what was poorly cleaned, then make the food and there aren't alot of none meat options that they aren't sick of already because usually they only have 1 or 2 things they can eat, then having to wash everything again because they get yelled at if they don't. And usually their parents question why their eating what they are instead of the meat option one of their parents has cooked. If not that their parents will come in and leave their dishes for my partner and just say \"wash this while you was yours will you?\" And just walk away, so on top of all of the work to just make a simple meal for themselves, they have to either do their family's dishes for them or get nagged about what they eat. So they tend to simply avoid making food for themselves. Usually if I'm there they will work up the motivation to make food because they want me to eat, or I will tell them we need to eat and will help with the process. I'm also pescetarian so that's an excuse for him not to eat meat while I'm there. \n\nThey're also scared of fish no matter how much they're told there's no bones in it and will smash it to a paste practically to make sure there are no bones. They're scared of certain foods that are stored in certain cabinets in their home they've had a problem with a certain cabinet getting bugs in it so they're scared of that cabinet sometimes.  They also feel like their fridge is dirty so if something is not stored right they will not eat it.\n\nThere are alot of other things but this is already getting super long so I'll try to be short with the rest. They can't accommodate their fears in their house because their parents are super weird and old fashioned about stuff so they have to deal with that. I try to help the best I can but I can't always be there or they here so yeah. The thing we feel like matches the most is AFRID but we have very limited knowledge so it would be nice to hear about other possibilities of what this could potentially be so we can do more research. They're currently seeing our school therapist/psychologist(there is a word for it in our language but not in English, but it's basically someone you go see to talk to about life but their aren't quite as qualified as a therapist and psychologist, usually they are employed in schools) in secret because their parents don't belive in therapy and mental health issues so they can't seek further treatment until they turn 18. We just want to find ways for them to cope until they can get into a better life situation and to help them eat. We've been thinking of getting them their own mini fridge and thar would definitely help but money is tight rn so we'll have to see. \n\nSo yeah main question is what should we look into and research? Does anything exist that lines up with their experiences? Thank you for reading this far if you did, and a massive thank you to anyone who replies! <3",

I used to be obese and loved sugary stuff since I was a kid, but recently, I used extremely restrictive diet to lose half of my original weight and now I seem to have binge eating disorder.\n\nDuring 2 years of restrictive diet, I nearly avoid all carb and used protein as my main energy source. Sometimes I would overindulge myself with sugary food on 1 day every few months.\n\nThus, some weird obsessions have been formed in my mind like \"if I allow myself to eat carb, why don't I just eat sugary food till I feel satisfied ?\". \n\nIt wasn't a problem before since I was still addicted to weight loss but recently things start to lose control. Everyday the only thing I want to eat is sugary food. I don't know if I am addicted to sugar but I actually start to feel discomfort if I quit sugar for a single day. In the beginning, I ate Oreo, Lotus for lunch and dinner, Now I can even eat nutella sauce without bread or simply eat sugar cubes wihout easily feeling cloyed.\n\nI have talked to therapists, one recommends me not to restrict myself since my unhealthy relationship with food was caused by long-term deprivation of carb and by restriction. Therefore, she recommends me to eat whatever I want and the problem would be settled when I compensate myself enough. However, I am really doubtng if this is gonna work for me, cuz I feel myself crave more and more sugar over time and I don't know if I could fully compensate myself. Secondly, It was also because of sugary food that I became obese in the first place when I was very young. I felt extremely difficult to control myself over sugar. \n\nI always have all-or-nothing mentality. Theoretically, \"moderation\" is the perfect answer, but it is so difficult to me. When I eat one oreo cookie, it becomes so hard to stop eating till I get cloyed. This kind of mindset appeared since my childhood but has definitely been reinforced by my indulge-restriction cycle on carb. \n\nI also suffer from OCD since I was in elementary school and I have been taking fluvoxamine for almost 7 years. My psychiatrist reckons my eating problem is a part of my ocd but my drug definitely doesn't help with my sugar obsession so far.\n\nI like doing things going cold turkey, like I quited smoking and alcohol all on a single day without gradual reduction of consumption. I don't know if I should also quit sugar this way since so many people claiming that extreme restriction can aggravate unhealthy relationship and I am afraid it will be true since that's exactly why I am more addicted to sugar than before. If I start to restrict myself again from sugar, will there be someday I cannot resist the craving and eat more of it ?\n\nPlease help me if you have any experience or advice. Everyday I am experiencing binge sugar eating and intense regret afterwards, I cannot focus on work nor studies, I am nearly a NEET now. ",

Now im slowly starting to eat more and on the journey on overcoming all these issues. If you are going through the same thing as I did (not eating enough) please stop immediately and start eating more.

        "Text": "My cousin has had an eating disorder for 4 years now - I think AN binge/purge subtype - and recently got kicked out of her house. Her parents are essentially devil spawn and I have watched them bully her into having this eating disorder since we were children. Obviously I immediately picked her up and told her she can live with us as long as she needs to, even forever if she wants. \n\nI had always known about the ED and tried to talk to her and help, but its so much easier to do from afar. I have never lived with someone with an ED before, and it's been extremely difficult. \n\nWe are a pretty busy family of 5 and whoever cooks usually makes enough for everyone to eat and leaves it on the stove because scheduling means we don't sit down and eat together much. The fridge is always full of leftovers. Since my cousin has been here, I've been starving. By the time I want to eat, all the curry is gone, all the rice, the yoghurt, milk, sugar, snacks, airfryer food - in addition to her own groceries. She stays up all night watching TV and eating, leaves the shower on for ages to cover up the purging, and doesn't clean the toilet afterward either. \n\nOur family is extremely frugal - if there's a way to budget something, we've done it. We're not in a financial place to afford groceries everyday, the electricity bill or the water bill. I don't want her to leave because going back to her parents' house will make her a million times worse and she can't afford any rent in our area as a student with a casual job. \n\nAll these things are so sensitive and it feels awful to bring it up to her because its so awkward and I know it's out of her control. I've been trying to organise a day to go to a psychologist with her, hopefully that will be some time this week, but I need to speak to her about all this too. \n\nMy parents love her so much but they're so tired and stressed and sick of not having anything to eat after a long day. They would never kick her out but they want to do something which would make her want to leave, like ask for a very high rent. \n\nI've been super drained having her in our home but the ED is really very bad - her parents took her to hospital and when she refused treatment, the doctors warned that if/when she got sick again, it would be very hard to treat her. I'm so terrified that I'll lose her if she goes anywhere else. She's not the best socially so I am her only real friend - I cannot handle this, but I am the only one who can handle this. \n\nSo far, I've spoken to her about how I'm worried and getting help - she agreed and said she wanted help. I have endured her parents yelling and swearing at me asking me who I think I am. I have fought with my own parents to not let her parents take her away, I've trained them on how to speak to her and to not be overbearing. I've made an info pamphlet to give her parents (hopefully they won't rip it up), contacted a psychologist and am trying to find a day she feels up to going in. I listen to her for hours at a time, often as soon as I wake up and when I'm going to bed too. \n\nIt's coming up to a month now of her living with us. She's been telling me that not hearing her parents yelling at her every morning has helped a lot and she's been feeling way better, but all the food is still disappearing, so I have no clue if I'm helping her or if it's all in vain. \n\nI'm losing so much sleep over this, I have no clue what I'm doing or how to handle this situation and I feel so alone in trying to help her. I would really appreciate any advice. ",

        "Text": "Hi everybody! I don't know why I've never thought of joining a group like this where I'm able to read, resonate and learn from people going through the same struggles as I have. I'm a 26F and I've been on and off purging for 6 years. Let me give you a bit more background:\n\n  \nIt started right after I graduated high school, and it's been a rollercoaster since the first day. My entire life, I've rarely felt happy/satisfied with how I look. Living in a Mexican household, it was very difficult to find any structure or know what food groups can cause you harm if eaten excessively. I would grow up hearing comments around by body from aunts, uncles, family friends and even parents. Any time I would gain weight, it was always pointed out in a negative way. If I seemed to have lost any, it would the greatest accomplishment I could ever have in my family's eyes. And this was all before the age of 15. It was around this time that I started getting closer to my best friend at the time, who was going through the same thing. She grew up a bit wider because of her parents genetics, and she had started getting very interested in tumblr threads on becoming anorexic, bulimia, and purging as she also had a fascination for losing as much weight as possible. She would often tell me about her experiences, and she even encouraged me to eat as little as possible to get results and even to purge (she had lost most of her weight our second term of Senior year) and I lost a significant amount by starving myself for 2-3 days at a time and surviving off of tuna cans on the days I felt too weak. Sometimes during lunch, we would share an apple and call it a day. We were in it together. At the time, I never participated as throwing up my food seemed like something so out of this world, so wrong. But the curiosity stayed in the back of my head.\n\n  \nShortly after graduating high school, I noticed that the lack of structure at school gave me enough time to relapse and start eating like crazy. I had no self control, and I would eat so much while not working out as I used to. It's safe to say that I gained everything back and more shortly after. I felt like a failure and so disgusted at myself for getting to that point. I remember the thing that triggered me to purge for the very first time was going on a blind date, and feeling so ashamed for my date to be repulsed by the girl he was going out with. And as soon as I did purge, I felt a huge relief. I felt that if I ended up eating bad again ever, all I have to do is throw up and the damage would be reversed. I have now been in a vicious cycle for 6 years, and I have been able to keep my weight off. \n\n  \nI got married 4 years ago, and I had to come clean to my boyfriend at the time as he heard me in the bathroom aggressively forcing myself to throw up after one of our first date nights. He obviously was very concerned for my health, and begged me to stop. I keep telling him no matter how much I try to set my mind to stop, it feels like a parasite or a monster taking control of my head and I become unresponsive to anything else but to rid the food before it starts to digest. I will say however, that I'm getting better with my relationship with food. Sometimes I'll have a \"bad meal\" (which I'm slowly starting to learn that no food is bad as long as it's in moderation), but I still end up purging about 2-3 times a week - mostly on the weekends (compared to every single day as when I first started). Every time it happens, I feel like I will never recover. I've been more consistent with my workouts so that I don't feel as bad when I don't stay on routine with my meals, I meal prep Monday through Friday and I try to eat mindfully during the weekends, and I journal constantly. But somehow, I always go back to that one meal that I love that I shouldn't love and I get it anyway knowing I can just throw it up right after. It gets me to a point where I just feel lost and like I'll never get better. My husband tries his best to understand, but no matter how many alternatives he tries to find for me or words of encouragement he gives me, nothing snaps me out of it. He doesn't understand the depth of it, and I feel to ashamed to share every dark thought that plays through my head during those episodes.\n\n  \nI'm not sure what I'm looking for - Maybe some words of advice, places or blogs where I can find real help that I can stick with and incorporate for the rest of my life, or hearing that someone has gone through something similar and has been able to overcome this monster of a disorder. Anything helps.",

Couple months ago while eating a dinner, I felt like something was stuck in my esophagus, I got scared and called an ambulance, they didn't find anything in my throat, then they put a tube in my stomach, but they didn't find anything either, but the feeling that something was stuck, like it was hard to swallow, persisted, so I went to the otolaryngologist again, they didn't find anything, then I went to the gastroenterologist again, they put a tube in my stomach again, they found the H.pylori bacteria and that I have reflux. So I'll have to watch my diet and take medication. I also had an esophagus test, but everything is fine with it. But I'm still afraid of swallowing food, so I'll have to go to a psychiatrist. I eat only blended food. I afraid to eat regular food, I fear that I'll choke. I've never experienced choking on food, but this irrational fear just torments me. Has anyone ever experienced this?

I feel like the interruption in behaviors would be helpful, even if I’m unsure about if that level of care is appropriate for someone who doesn’t need weight restoration, and is physically stable. I’m seeing a new ED therapist on Friday and I plan on being honest with her about my behaviors. I’m wondering if I’ll be able to get better with just the therapist alone? It’s hard for me to see just how unwell I am since I’ve been in this state for years now and nothing “bad” has happened (in the sense of passing out, having seizures, heart issues, etc). But I know it’s only a matter of time, so I really need to stop. I’m unsure if therapy once a week is enough to stop a binge purge cycle that’s been going on for years. \n\nSo basically, have any of you managed to get better with therapy? Or is residential more helpful? I’m sure my therapist will let me know if she thinks I need a higher level of care, but I’d like to know what to expect.",

I am currently recovering from anorexia and orthorexia and have a friend who has had very similar experiences to me including recovering from both of the same disorders. Said friend who we will call C, is very into the holistic, raw, non toxic, homeopathic diets and medicines which personally is a huge trigger for me because that was what my hyper fixation was when I was deep into my orthorexia. She recently posted a story from a diet influencer, no RD certifications, talking about how raw milk is illegal but things like nesquick are not. So I replied, \"please tell me you're not drinking raw milk,\" as I have read so much on it and about how it can cause so many health issues. I should also mention I have OCD in which I am constantly thinking about all of my friends and family dying if I do not complete certain rituals. This reply spiraled into a back and forth with me attempting to provide studies and resources about the dangers because now im anxious about her getting sick (OCD brain) and my friend kind of dismissing what I was saying without evidence. (e.g., I would ask \"do you have an article I can read about that or a source I would love to read it,\" only to be met with,\"this conversation is not productive, you know holistic medicine is sacred to me.\")  I should also mention I am queer and the account the og post is from has posted anti-LGBTQ retoric which was additonally very disheartening to see that my friend was following this person. I shared my experience with holistic diet culture and how it affected me as a child who grew up with food insecurity and on the poverty line and why I am skeptical of some of the practices pushed but ultimatley her response made me feel like my personal experience with it was invalid. I think it also just triggered a part of me that I haven't felt in awhile which was feeling lesser for not ever being able to afford the organic, raw, whole foods and buying regular milk from the store or eating a bag of chips and I can just feel myself spiraling. This friend has always been the friend I've gone to when I'm having a relapse or rough days and vice versa. Idk if this made any sense but I can feel a return of the old coming and I think posting here where other's understand might help. I just recently moved too so being away from my therapist has I think exacerbated everything lol. thanks guys",

I always knew it wasn’t the best but figured I’ve made it this far so I didn’t really need help. Now my loved ones, nutritionist, therapist and doctor are all urging me to go to a recovery center. I know deep down it will be good for me but I am absolutely terrified to go. With missing out on all the holidays, not being around the people I care about and having to be out of work for a while I am feeling very insecure and keep going back and forth on whether or not I should go. Any advice? Words of comfort? I’m just trying to stop myself from talking myself out of it ",

This is one of things I'm worried about: saying things that will make things worse/make my daughter feel worse. \n\nWe think our 13 year old daughter has an eating disorder. She has always been quite fussy with what she'll eat but now she eats very little every day, is out walking for hours everyday focussed on getting as many steps as she can. She has lost a fair bit of weight and is complaining of being tired all the time she isn't walking or in bed. She is on the pathway for ASD diagnosis. We have shared our concerns but she doesn't consider herself to have an issue and won't consider seeing a GP (we are in UK). We have a plan for my wife to have a proper chat with her on Wednesday by themselves out of the house (we have two young children that make having serious talks at the house). I'm not looking for medical advice but maybe if within the rules of the group for how you would have wanted to be spoken to in this instance? We are obviously worried she will continue with her current mindset/habits/trajectory and end up more seriously ill/in hospital etc. ",

It started with me simply not being able to eat without puking right after (not self-inflicted), at some point I was so afraid of puking that I simply didn't eat anymore and forgot to eat for days. I still forget about it if I'm not careful. Now though I started binging and purging bit ago after my recent breakup.  \n\nMy doctor is really incompetent (not just my view but she was good for getting sick notes lol) so I don't really have a way to get medical treatment rn as I am trying to find a better doctor but it's not that easy. \n\nAnyways, back to my question. Does anyone have any tricks to not purge? I've tried breathing techniques and temperature sensations but it doesn't help me enough. Last night I was up all night fighting the urge to binge and ultimately failed. Now after waking up I still feel like I have to purge. I'm really scarred of it as I am already pretty low on everything. \n\nAside from that, is there a term for ED'S with which people are afraid of binging, therefore don't eat but when they eat they puke without wanting to?\n\nThank you for anyone who replies ♡♡",

I am currently at the smallest I’ve ever been and I got here by restricting my calorie intake and  working out 6 days a week. Food and losing weight is an obsession. I at one point put a padlock on my fridge. Even though I’m at a pretty low weight I feel like I’m trapped in a fat suit and the feeling of being full makes me want to crawl out of my skin. People around me have noticed that the subject of food in general makes me on edge. They’ve also noticed the weight loss. Something I’ve been doing more recently is trying to be less restrictive and allow myself to eat something I don’t usually. Lately it’s been at least once a week I extremely over eat and then throw it up. I could go on and on. But anyways it’s ruining my life. I cannot function. I cannot have a social life for fear of having to be around food. It’s driven most people that were close to me away. Yet my therapist says I do not have an eating disorder, since my symptoms don’t fit any single disorder textbook definition. It really feels like there is something disordered about this and I don’t know how to beat it. I am thin but I’m not emaciated. Anyways, I feel as though I’m not making any progress with this therapist as I’ve been seeing them for over a month and still have yet to get any sort of concrete diagnosis. It’s making me feel like a lost cause. Thoughts?",

When she came to live with us she also brought her boyfriend who she broke up with months after moving out. I'm worried this could've triggered something and from photos I don't know if she's recovering and I'm really worried. I don't want her to be upset by asking if she's okay, especially because stuff has been hard for her and her twin. We've been talking more than usual lately but I'm still scared she isn't telling the truth.",

        "Text": "Hello everyone, Here I am because I got a complex story with food and I don’t know how to get out of it. To sum up, i’m greedy since i’m a child and used to love eat. However, from my middle school years, I think it’s when I started eating to manage some stress or social anxiety, I didn’t realise it was emotional eating until I started gain lot of weight in one year. Then, one day, after have seen one pic of me, I found myself horrible and decided to be on diet, then I started to suffer of anorexia. I lose too much kilos in only some months. After that, I didn’t want to go to hospital then I gained a weight out of danger. Then I started studying at university, and these three years was okay, but I was staying in a comfort zone by weighing myself several times a day and by controlling what I was eating. Then, at the end of these three years, I gained again some weight because I was doing suddenly crisis where I was eating a lot, like 4 meals for one I was used to eat. After it was stabilised, I started solo traveling and it was a good period when I was not thinking too much about food or appearance.\n\nRecently, I started a new formation, in an other country. It is the second year, and now I think my problems with alimentation came back. When i’m out or with my friends, I am not hungry at all because when i’m home I just eat to manage all my emotions. But the thing is that I’m in period of stress and eating is actually the best way to remove all this stress. But it makes me take weight and that stresses myself more and make me eat more and it is a cycle, and because of that I also don’t eat really properly and consistently, and I think I became addict to sugar.\n\nAnd all of that is related also to my uncontrolled desire to be accept by others, and the problem is that in my head, I emphasize so much the other people’s comments related to the appearance, even if it’s not for me (like my friends which are like “oh shit I gained 1 kilo”, or “cool, I lose one kilo during the trip”). I overthink what people can think of me, and sometimes i’m feeling like if I gain weight, it’s like i’m lame or not able to control myself, different to others, even though I know it is not true. And I don’t talk to that to anyone because i’m feeling they not gonna understand me, or they gonna tell me things that I heard already thousands of time and that I never made it. \n\nWhat should I do to get out if this cycle? To don't let my appearance matters that much? To get finally a normal alimentation which I realise now I never had? To don’t go eat sugar as soon as I have any uncomfortable emotions? I would be happy if you have any tips for me, thank you for having reading this message :)",

I have had solid recovery with no major slips or triggers for the last 4 years to the point I didn’t need to see my dietician anymore. It takes a lot to phase me at that point and ED is barely a whisper in the background.\n\nHowever, the last month has become increasingly difficult with body image obsession, difficulty regulating hunger cues, and difficulty accepting that my clothes are starting not to fit but I’m not far enough along for most maternity clothing fits. The thought of clothing shopping is paralyzing in a way I haven’t experienced since before receiving treatment 7 years ago. Its gotten to the point that I feel so uncomfortable at work as a teacher and I feel everyone can notice my clothes not fitting (I know thats probably not true but the intrusive thought is winning)\n\nI’ve been working with my long time therapist and reconnected with my dietician who both keep telling me to let go of control and give myself grace. I know they are right but I can’t seem to get myself to take the advice. My ED specialized dietician said several expectant mothers she has worked with in the past have found pregnancy freeing, but I haven’t found that at all and feel myself regressing/ nearing a relapse down the road. I have worked too hard to let that happen and I’m terrified of having everything undone. \n\n\nCan anyone relate to this? Any suggestions on what might help me let go of control and be more accepting of my changing body? I’m really struggling right now and don’t want ED to ruin another experience in my life.

I've spent the past 5 years actively trying to crawl out of this pit and I've done a lot of research on treatments for mental disorders. For social anxiety the most effective currently known and available treatment is exposure therapy alongside cognitive restructuring. \n\nRecently I started developing what appears to be an eating disorder so I was wondering what's the most proven way to treat ED at the moment? I'd like to kill the beast while it's still young.",

When he wakes up and throughout the day, even on his lunch break, he will either snack or not eat at all. He is underweight by a bit, and doesn't make the efforts to change despite talking to him. He has expressed wanting to get ensure for calories, but is worried about the cost. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this? Should I refer him to a clinic? He does eat, he doesn't restrict calories, but he always undereats the standard daily amount. Would he need to be in therapy to be more conscious or is this overstepping?

However, I am not immune to many triggers, and it is hard work mentally and physically to keep a strong aura around me.\n\nMy best friend who I haven’t seen in a very long time is coming to visit me next week. He has struggled with some disordered eating in the past as well, and I do my best to support her. However, I did have to set some boundaries years ago. He has somewhat upheld them, but the issue is that either he forgets that I struggle with disordered eating or thinks that due to my appearance that I can’t be struggling like he has.\n\nThat being said, every so often he will start using phrases and such that trigger me, either a little or a lot. When I’m triggered, my instinct is to protect myself so I don’t spiral, making it harder to be a good friend for him when it seems like he may need one.\n\nAs I mentioned, he is coming to visit me next week. It is only for a short time and for the first time in over half a year. He has been saying some things that are implying that I may need to prepare to brace myself for some body and food checking.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to be a good, supportive friend while protecting my own progress, but also being sure to avoid accidentally essentially saying “you  need to stfu.”… because I dont want him to shut up, I just need him to start being aware of how we talk about stuff. \n\n—\n\nMy other best friend has also had an ED, and once we discussed our pasts with each other, there really have been no issues. While I think she unconsciously struggles with some of the same assumptions about me the visiting friend has, we are both pretty good at respecting each other’s concerns. In addition to this, we are still able to be supportive and caring to one another. This friend has also noticed the lack of awareness from the visiting friend.",

        "Text": "My (18F) sister and I (19F) have always been extremely close but in the past 2 years her eating disorder has gotten so bad it’s plagued every part of her life. Around 2 years ago she got into her first real relationship with a total jerk of a guy that ended up making her feel horrible about herself physically and mentally. Soon after they broke up we started to find laxative wrappers laying around her room as well as her eating patterns change significantly.\n\nAt first my parents tried extremely hard to stop her from taking these laxatives as we know long term use can be dangerous. My parents would monitor what she would bring home, monitor her transaction history, and constantly check how long she was in the bathroom for. But she ended up just starting to steal the laxatives. Her depression has only gotten worse as well and she’s pushed a lot of her family and friends away. My parents have almost given up in a sense. They just feel that she’s an adult now and they both have full time jobs and can’t monitor her 24/7. \n\nTikTok and social media have been fueling her disorder as well. When she does eat she will only eat Greek yogurt with fruit once a day, or steak and eggs once a day. My mom bought the wrong steak that my sister doesn’t like today, and she threw a fit and left the house and starved herself. I tried cooking her pasta but she said she hates it and will become fat if she eats it. I eat pasta everyday and this hurt my feelings a lot- I know she doesn’t try to purposely hurt me but I’m not sure how to help if she refuses to eat everything. She says she only likes steak she hates chicken, fish, ground beef, and turkey. My sister relies on my parents completely financially as anytime she does manage to get a job, she won’t last long. She’s confessed to me that if she feels like she’s slightly gained weight she is too embarrassed to leave the house and will just no call no show to her job. I even got her a job at my workplace that she loved, but she stopped showing up. She’s begged me to try and get it back but I told her unless she tries to recover, the same cycle will repeat.\n\nI’ve talked to her today and it seems like she just doesn’t want to help herself and is relying on other people to do it for her. I told her we all have been supporting her and trying to help her but she’s been pushing us away. The only person that can truly get over these obstacles is herself- and of course she can use the tools we try to provide her. We also are struggling to provide professional mental help for her at the moment due to our loss of health coverage. (My dad recently got laid off) \nSo right now psychiatric help is off the table. What can I do to help her and show her I support her? This has been going on too long and she’s starting to look ill all of the time. I want my healthy and happy sister back, but her mental health and wellbeing has been completely compromised and she really cannot move forward in life to milestones like getting through college and getting a job because of how much this eating disorder affects her. Please for those who have recovered I’d appreciate some help with what to do. Thank you \n(I’m also not sure exactly what eating disorder she has. Typically she won’t eat for days and when she does eat it’s not a substantial amount. If we happen to go out to eat or eat something unhealthy she will eat it if she likes it, but I believe she then uses laxatives to avoid gaining weight from the food. I’m assuming she’s also constipated most times from using the laxatives for so long, she might just be taking them everyday-it’s hard to say.) ",

I have been in recovery for 12 years, since i was a child i have been living in hospitals and treatment centers and im just so sick of living in treatment centers (ive lived in inpatient units for up to a year). so i do not want to go back. i have anorexia with suspected ARFID (but my parents don’t believe in ARFID). I’m just wondering if it’s possible to get an NG tube outpatient. I am just so sick of the exhaustion from dealing with all the stuff that comes with oral intake, and the stuff from my parents that results from my struggling. i have comorbid mental illnesses so that makes things so much worse. i just need something to make this easier and try to get me more stable so i can stay out of treatment and in school. i have a full treatment team (psychiatrist, 3 therapists, an ED specialist doc, a primary care doc) but i am missing a dietician as my parents have been refusing to let me get one again but i am at the point where im just gonna try to get one on my own. i just feel stuck. i am wondering if somehow it’s possible to get an NG tube while staying outpatient, at home. i’ve seen others do it, and im just wondering HOW they do it. who do i talk to? what are the requirements? how do i go about it? i just really need some help because i don’t know what to do and i feel like this is probably the option that would best allow me to continue my life without having to pause everything to go back to treatment for god knows how long. any advice is appreciated, please. i hope you all are feeling okay :) ",

One of my housemates has been exhibiting ED behaviour since the beginning of university (getting progressively worse) and appears to be slowly isolating herself from us. I won't go into detail about her behaviours but it is quite evident they are unhealthy, compulsive and deteriorating. This year has been especially bad, as she is no longer going to any of our social events as a house, and we barely see her cook/eat at all compared to last year (always very specific safe foods and in very controlled portions). We believe she is increasingly compartmentalizing her life to conceal her behaviours from her different groups of friends. She is compulsively studying and performs at gigs in a band for many hours of the day. We want to help her and think this has progressed enough that it requires intervention. We are unsure if her parents are aware of these behaviours or if she successfully conceals them at home during the holidays. I have spoken to some of the counsellors at our university who encouraged me to bring it up in a sensitive way to her but told me they ultimately can't do anything because she's an adult. What can I do to make her feel safe with us to open up about it and/or point her in the direction of help? She is a people-pleaser kind of person and the main reason we haven't spoken about it with her before is that we believe she will just deny it and continue to isolate herself. We therefore don't want to make the situation inadvertently worse but at some point someone has to do something or I see her ending up in hospital.",

Eventually, they settled on the coworker taking the rest of the day off to go to the ER/urgent care for pain management and then insisted he take a few days off to get through some of the worst of it. This is relevant because I started to wonder --- if I started to look more sick due to my ED, would work say something to ME - especially if they think it hinders my job?\n\nHave any of you had your job/supervisor (not just regular coworkers) sit you down or force you to get care or take time away? Or worse --- have you been fired because of it? Is that allowed? What was/is your experience with being LW/UW looking very sick, or having symptoms of your ED cause disruptions at work? What happened? I've gotten paranoid about it happening to me now, haha. Coworkers that would usually barely say anything to me have now started to offer me food throughout the day, which could be nothing, but it does make me start to wonder if they are starting to assume or see anything like that about me cause I also never eat there.

        "Text": "I’ve recently been sick this week with intense nausea and stomach pain. Food doesn’t sound appetizing and if I do eat (which I’ve been still trying to force myself to do), I just feel even more nauseous afterwards. Even though I’m not intentionally starving myself, the ED voice is getting loud again. It’s like my inability to eat right now is just feeding the fire. And now I’m sitting here just wondering if I’m somehow keeping myself sick. I have three different anxiety diagnosis that tend to make me physically ill and unable to eat sometimes as well so it’s always so hard to distinguish between being genuinely sick or if its just one of my many mental health issues causing me physical symptoms. \n\nAnyway, I’m just curious if anyone struggles through similar scenarios occasionally? The only things I’ve been able to eat are buttered noodles and soup but I don’t want to just be eating pasta so are there any nutritious or healthier soft foods that anyone can think of? I’ve tried a smoothie and it wasn’t filling enough. I’m hungry but nauseous if that makes sense. But I can only really eat once a day right now so I need to be getting in nutrients because I’ve felt so weak, irritable, and tired. ",

In recent time though, I've kind of spiraled a bit more mentally than before and I think somehow she's noticed but now she keeps being weird around me. We aren't really close friends at all, just class friends but recently she keeps coming up to me and commenting on how my body looks saying things like \"where's your waist\" and once she even asked if I was wearing a corset. This isn't a compliment to me at all because I don't like anyone talking about my body and on top of that it isn't even genuine, feels more backhanded than anything. Additionally, she keeps approaching me and touching my stomach or feeling both sides of my waist like she's trying to feel if I'm wearing a corset or something like she suggested before, it's really weird and it's actually making me go crazy and I feel really horrible when it happens, it makes me feel stupid and ugly and I don't know if this comes off as stupid to be upset about but it really isn't helping me feel better mentally about how I'm struggling. I have weird bowel movements too and sometimes after lunch or something at school I'll just need to use the bathroom, and I've struggled with bulimia but it's not even about that it's just normal after eating I just go to the toilet, yet when me and her are around people and I tell her I'll be right back, for some reason she's started saying quite loudly, \"you better not be going in there to throw up or something\", not even in a considerate tone either just more condeseningly and everyone can hear. I'm so scared of confrontation and I know the solution is probably just to confront her and tell her to stop but she's historically not been the easiest person to listen to other people and take up criticism. She sits next to me in almost every lesson we have together and I can't really move seats because our teachers can be strict in that. What can I do?",

I need to fast tomorrow since I overate today. How many calories is this? That’s too many calories.

I work out and generally eat SO well during the week and feel so proud. The weekends, though, I am RUINED. I am absolutely addicted to sugar, I will go the whole day eating nothing but cookies and cereals and ice cream on a Saturday. I am short, so that is a lot of calories for me to consume. I can’t break the cycle, I eat until I am in severe pain and look very large and stay up all night thinking about it. I want to cry, I am so depressed. I am so discouraged.

I’ve been so focused on giving him a healthy balanced diet, that I forgot about my own.. let me start by saying I’ve been in recovery for opiates for 2 years and although relapse is not a concern I can feel old tendencies starting to creep. I used to only eat when I would use because I’d be sick. And usually that would be later in the day or at night.. so I wouldn’t eat all day and then try to eat a days worth of food at night. Well I want to say about a month ago idk if I ate dinner to late or what but I started to feel nauseous in the morning and just really have a hard time eating when I wake up. Then by the time I’m finally hungry, it’s time to put my son down to take a nap and by the time he’s finally asleep I’m so hungry that I’m nauseous and nothing sounds good. But I still force myself to eat (if I remember) but even then, usually not much. And then later in the evening I suddenly get STARVING! And then I eat a lot and it’s like a cycle. I didn’t think it was too much of an issue until I started my new job working nights and have been struggling to even eat at night now and I am starting to lose too much weight .. I love food and idk why I’m having such a hard time breaking this cycle. But when I eat I feel like I’m manually chewing and forcing myself to swallow.. not to mention even when I did eat regularly, I’ve never really had a well balanced/healthy diet.. I got clean when i found out I was pregnant and I had to learn how to be a mother, an adult, and relearn to live life clean all at the same time and I felt like when he was a newborn I actually handled it pretty well.. and I feel like I had even more on my plate mentally at that time so why does it suddenly feel so much harder?? I know my son becoming a toddler and walking has added to the stress and sometimes I genuinely just forget to eat but I don’t know.. being a single mom is hard sometimes lol I think I just need advice/tips to try to regulate my eating and get myself on a good diet; because I know the lack of food and sleep combined is not helping my mental health.  I also am in the process of learning how to cook and can’t eat out too often, so I am open to any easy go to recipes🫶🏼\n\n\nAlso want to add I do see a counselor and psychiatrist and am planning to address this at our next meeting. This is my first post on Reddit ever so no judgment please, I’m just trying to be my best self for my baby.🫶🏼",

        "Text": "My fiance is underweight and wasn't eating much to a serious level. That I worried if he sat by himself and didn't think about food he wouldn't eat until absolutely necessary. \n\nSo I asked about it and after some back and forth he explained as a kid he used to eat what we call \"garbage food\" (large amounts of overall unbalanced stuff) and all the adults told him that metabolism would catch up with him and picked on him. Horrible things to say to a kid basically. Then as he started getting older he saw bigger family members unable to do rides (rollar coasters, go karts, all types of things) or participate in lots of fun things. This made me think of anorexia minus the calorie counting. So I'm unsure if I'm right on a guess or if I'm waaaaay off. I would really appreciate any suggestions if I'm wrong.\n\nHe claims he kinda tricked his mind into not eating as much so that he wouldn't get large in size at any point in his life. And now as an adult he eats maybe a meal in a day and if he smokes I can get him to feel an appetite. Thankfully.\n\n I asked him if he would eventually want to gain weight or just eat more in general so it's not as intimidating (genetics play part his family is on the smaller size so no guarantee in gain of weight) he replied yes. But almost every website and internet search bring up loss of weight, or medical and psychiatric.\n\nThank you to any advice and support on this. This isn't really my skillset so I feel like I'm unable to help him and as his partner i want to say I tried everything in my power to help.",

I eat pretty healthy in general, but I love to bake and obviously eat those sweet things. A big part of my ED was B/P and I know now that if I restrict i will end up binging. If I’m not looking for certain “results” with the gym besides strength and mental health reasons, is it ok to just work out and not count calories or deliberately restrict any certain types of food?",

My mom signed me up for rowing camp. I met the coach and some of the varsity girls and I decided to do it in the fall. Why’d I decide to do it? Because they were all SO skinny. All I could think about was how much I wanted to look like them. Come fall season, i join the novice team and really connect with the coach. She tells us all the time how food is fuel and we need to take care of our bodies.  She talks about how fun exercise is. She pushes us to work hard but also rest. Instead of creating fear around food, she organizes team pasta dinners and makes sure we have protein and carb filled foods on race day. When I baked cookies for the team, she didn’t hesitate to say yes when I asked her if she wanted one. Now, i can say something I never thought i would, id rather be strong than skinny. And I know im not completely better, i still have work to do. But, I haven’t self harmed, tracked calories, cried over my weight, or made myself throw up since I started rowing!

I literally wake up everyday just wanting food. When I finish my meal I start thinking when will my next meal be and so on.\n\nIt is so tiring, I can only stop thinking about food when I have something important to do like assignments or studying, but once I am over with that I am thinking about food once again.\n\nIm making sure to eat the right portions, including every single nutrients. I also cut out any type or exercise to let my body fully recover.\n\nEven after all this time and being consistent I still can’t stop thinking about food.\n\nWhat’s weird is that I don’t have any specific cravings, it’s just that I am hungry all the time. I don’t even remember how feeling satisfied was like.\n\nI must also mention that at the very beginning of my recovery I started taking levothyroxine because my internist doctor thought I had hypothyroidism because of my Anorexia. Turns  out I had no problems with my thyroid, in fact, taking that medication made me have hyperthyroidism because of the constant stimulation to my thyroid (I didn’t really understood how that worked, but well, the important thing is that I was taking that medication since May all the way to August). Another internist doctor saw my medical records and said that I had been wrongly diagnosed with hypothyroidism. He also told me to cut out the medication.\n\nI don’t know if that incident with my thyroids has anything to do with this, but I think it maybe does.\n\nLeaving that aside, it is truly exhausting thinking about food all the time. I can not concentrate in any of my hobbies (watching videos or playing video games) because of the constant thoughts about eating. I basically feel that I must distract myself everyday from food until it’s time for me to eat. \n\nI just want to go back like when I was younger. I was hungry, I ate and problem solved. I could concentrate and enjoy my hobbies without distractions.\n\nHas any one else experienced something similar? I feel at lost.\n\nI thought this feeling would last about a month or so.

Although she has now been seeing a therapist (i think she is just trying to make me and her mom happy) her symptoms continue to get worse and hurt our relationship. This lack of self esteem has also made her embody the personality of the “party girl” among her friends because when she started getting seriously intoxicated her friends thought it was funny and now she has become obsessed with living out that persona. It’s a recurring cycle of drinking on an empty stomach, passing out drunk somewhere, and me having to come pick her up and hold her hair back as she drunkenly pukes even more. I love my girlfriend to death, and have done all that I know in order to be there for her.

I'm 20 years old and I live with my parents and obviously they don't know, I don't know if I want to tell them either.\nSometimes when my mother calls me fat it makes me want to scream in her face to stop telling me because she has no idea what's behind it, but it's an intrusive thought that goes away afterward. but at the same time, another reason I don't want to tell them is because I don't want to make them feel guilty. Another reason is also that I think they wouldn't understand it, that they wouldn't see it as something serious and that they wouldn't take me seriously.

This however was a big change and also has to do with body image and bullying from other peers.\n\nShe has since gotten back from the doctor after leaving a bit heavier but was there for weeks, and was told to go on quite a strict diet, but she is obsessed with being healthy and pretty much just eats salads, she wont even eat meat because apparently it makes her feel really sick.\n\nAt first she seemed open to other options, but slowly she seemed more and more stubborn, for example refusing to try protein powder even thought she thought it was smart before as well as powdered liver capsules (which would super help with proteins and other things) but now she refuses to try any of it but has no excuse for why she wont, some of the most concerning things she has done is went into a bit of a frenzy over gaining a tiny tiny bit of weight, and also didn't even want to eat AVOCADO'S because of how much fat was in it. \n\nHer mom is in denial and thinks doctors are overreacting and is letting her do this, and I just don't know what to do. She has been more and more uncaring in our conversations (we have barely talked recently) and I think its because its affecting her brain, I am considering trying to talk to her mom and try to tell her how serious this actually is but I think I will be sacrificing the friendship if I do so. \n\nAdvice is so so appreciated, this has been scary and ive never experienced something like this before, and she could genuinely die if this keeps up.",

I was seeking out why I was feeling so awful all around (GI dr & endocrinologist) because I don’t remember being this bad in the past. \n\nI went to the ED last week to check everything because I had a breakdown and got terrified. I sobbed the whole way there because I was scared it’s my first time talking about it and I still was iffy about wanting to make a change, but I did it. They referred me to an outpatient clinic. Today was my first appointment. I have been feeling horrible all around physically, mentally but I have always felt that people have it so much worse than I do, if my ed was that serious I wouldn’t be able to do xyz, hence why I see other specialists. \n\nTurns out, it’s much worse than I ever thought. The NP looked at me and said “I need you to understand that you are very sick” and talked to me about how I am severely malnourished. I’m feeling so many different emotions. I’m angry at myself, I’m sad on where I am, I’m scared to change, I want to give myself a hug, I want to cry … just everything. I’m a mess. She recommended a 10 day inpatient at the children/adolescent inpatient or a residential one. I have to call her in the morning and tell her my decision. I’m heavily leaning towards 10 day hospital inpatient. But overall I’m just scared and overwhelmed. I could use ANY advice anyone has to give. \n\nI’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense, I am drained. ",

She has even wanted to get her own chickens. She will only drink raw milk, she drinks a keifer smoothie for breakfast every single day and doesn’t eat again until dinner time. She spends hundreds of dollars to get meat from a butchered cow from a very well renowned farmer. \n\nShe says everything in the grocery store is poison, if you eat processed food you will get chronic illnesses, develop cancer and just in general die at a young age. So she is very selective buying things from the store it’s usually ingredients like cinnamon, salt, or butter. She will spend a lot of time in the store just reading every single ingredient in stuff. She also barely eats out ever and if she does she has to eat at a very expensive restaurant. \n\nShe had told people they are overweight because they drink Diet Coke and they will develop diabetes. She used to get very upset if i walked in with a McDonald’s bag even if it was only once in a while. As a kid I was always hungry and would eat dry cheerios or bread after school because she refused to buy snacks. \n\nI agree a lot of what she says that they add a lot of bad stuff to our food especially in the United States but I feel like it just continues to get more extreme. Her and my grandma are the same even saying stuff like they have to order bananas from a different country because they are supposed to have big seeds in them and that regular bananas are genetically modified. \n\nI just think it is an issue because she should be able to live her life and be able to eat French fries once in a while without feeling awful about it. She spends so many hours in the kitchen preparing food like she lives in the 1900s, I don’t know maybe this is something I shouldn’t be concerned about.

After having that confirmation(again, a mystery) I reluctantly had breakfast, consisting of non fat Greek yogurt with chia seed, a whole wheat cookie,an apple and water. Afterwards I *HAD* to go for a walk even if I was feeling tired, I just couldn't go rest/read/do something relaxing. I'm on holiday, I really wanted to rest during this time but I feel like I'm not allowed or can't, I have to move before or after every meal. \nHad a little cry during my walk, Then I went grocery shopping and had lunch(lentils, natural mackerel fillets, quinoa, some cherry tomatoes). The feeling of fullness has started to feel uncomfortable. Now I had some tea and a clementine as a midday snack. \n\nSo, I always try to eat as healthy as possible, I don't allow myself dessert, like the other day I was craving ice cream but I just couldn't eat it because I'm gaining weight again and I'm scared. Every night I go to sleep dreading the scale. My weight and food are a constant noise in my mind.\n\nI was overweight as a child and in my teens, I went to a dietitian when I was around 12yo but never succeeded with my diet. A few years back I started going on walks and eating a little bit better and I lost a lot of weight. Then last year I decided to also go to the gym, feeling happy about it and very motivated, and healthy, but because of my work i stopped going for a while and now the thought of going fills me with dread.\n\nI don't purge(I admit that I considered it for the very first time last night after dinner because I was feeling uncomfortably full), i eat 3-4 times a day, food thats considered whole and healthy, and I try to move everyday even if I'm tired, but in my mind there's always this voice saying that I'm not doing enough, that I have to earn lunch or dinner, that I haven't walked enough steps today to justify having even a piece of dark chocolate after dinner.\n When I go out with friends in the afternoon and we go to a cafe I order a coffee and nothing else, and I can't remember the last time I went out to dinner..\nI'm just tired of feeling like this.",

I felt good about my progress. I was enjoying my workouts and eating better. My skin was glowing, and I felt confident. But then my parents stepped in and started criticizing my body again, just like they did back in high school when I lost a lot of weight in a really short amount of time. Now, with a big wedding coming up, they want me to drop weight fast to “look good” for it.\n\nFeeling the pressure, I started looking for quicker ways to lose weight and came across intermittent fasting. A lot of people were getting quick results, so I decided to try it. But it brought back all my old, unhealthy eating habits. I thought I’d be okay fasting for a certain amount of time, but I ended up pushing it for much longer than intended. On top of that, I am hitting the gym while fasting. Now I’m constantly exhausted, both physically and emotionally, and I just feel like crying all the time.\n\nAfter another fight with my mom about my eating habits, I finally sat her down to explain everything. I told her how my relationship with food isn’t normal and how their constant criticism has really affected me. She got it and apologized a lot, but now she’s upset with both herself and me. She keeps pushing me to eat, but I’ve told her I can’t just go back to eating normally overnight, and I don’t think she really understands that.\n\nI think she talked to my dad about it, but he’s super insensitive. I genuinely can’t stand him. He never admits when he’s wrong. Today was supposed to be my mom’s birthday, and we were going out for dinner. After fasting for a long stretch, I was really looking forward to a good meal for the first time in ages. But my dad insisted we go somewhere with salads, completely ignoring that I hadn’t eaten for ages. I lost it and locked myself in my room, crying for hours. I just wanted to have a burger, but he expects me to stick to a salad after I’ve been starving myself for days.\n\nI feel so lost right now. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but I’m completely drained. I just want to enjoy a meal without feeling guilty. I’m already dreading the restaurant because I know he’ll say something like, “I thought you were on a diet,” if I order anything other than the lowest calorie option.\n\nI really don’t know what to do. I can’t go to therapy. I don’t trust any of the therapists around here. I just want to feel better, to hear someone say that I don’t need to lose weight so quickly and that I’m okay the way I am.",

At first I was really proud of her but now I think she is taking it too far. I didn’t question her methods because she is eating but it’s her fixation that worries me. The scale is in my room as I bought it and she weighs herself so much. What I’ve noticed is; in the morning, before she eats, after eating, after the toilet, random times during the day, after the gym and before bed. I noticed something was weird when we both went to get some groceries after the gym and she was so upset I was buying myself rice cakes… then at the till she proceed to start a convo with the cashier about how much crap the rice cakes contained… then she told me how she accidentally drank regular coke rather than Coke Zero and nearly had a panic attack?? she keeps telling me her goal weight but when she reaches it she then changes it to lower. What’s worse is we both weigh about the same but she insists she looks better than me. I personally struggled a lot as I have a body ‘deformity’ so comments don’t hurt me anymore but I wonder if she is doing this to almost one up me? Im really worried because I don’t understand her end goal? I don’t understand how she is planning on living her life like this constantly on protein, electrolytes, etc like we haven’t been to a restaurant in ages because she refuses to eat food she doesn’t make. Am I wrong for being worried ? Or is this a normal fitness mindset ",

I have some tips which I hope maybe can help for some of you:)\n\nSo my first one which I think the most important is getting help. It really helps a lot and can make the process more painless and faster. I recommend it and it already helped me a lot.\nAt the moment I have a psychologist and I go to family therapy.Yes,family therapy. It is very helpful in most cases even if I thought that it has nothing to do with it. So if you have this option than go for it.\n\nThe second one is learning about it. I started reading a book and listening to podcasts. And this helps me A LOT. Finally I feel like I am not alone with this and I understand why these things happens to me. I think there are lots of books these days. And some give you a plan to recover so I really recommend this too.\n\nThe last one is being patient. Try to embrace and understand the situation and stop feeling guilty about it. You have to understand that you are not alone and you can make through it even if you think at the moment that it is impossible. It really isn't! Just trust the process.\n\nAnd there are groups where you can join and recover with other people too.\n\nI really hope this helped you and you got this!<3 Love you all!",

My (23M) long distance boyfriend (20M) has suffered quite badly with anorexia in the past. Obviously, EDs don't just disappear so he struggles more than usual every now and then. However, he is in a really tough place at the moment and it's the worst I've seen it since we've known each other and the first time it's happened since we have gone long distance. \n\nFrom what he's said to me, he hasn't relapsed and started starving himself like in the past but it has caused him to change his eating habits and there are moments where its all he can think about. \n\nThe issue is, because I'm not there for him in person, I don't know how best to help him. I try to listen and ask him how he's doing but I constantly worry that I'm overstepping or I'm going to say something that accidentally makes it worse. He has said that he hates it when the friend he is living with asks him he's he's eaten today, what he's having later, etc (with the best intentions) so I don't want to do that because it may make things worse - but at the same time, I want to know these things because I'm concerned? \n\nI love my boyfriend very much and I just feel a bit useless at the moment so any advice you guys are able to give me on how best i can help/be there for him would be very very much appreciated. \n\nThanks ",

I don't remember a time when my mother didn't tell me I'm too fat and need to lose weight. It's messed with my self worth a lot as a kid but I've long accepted that fat isn't a bad word or anything negative. To me, it just became fact. I'm fat, just like I'm blond and left handed. I've never really had physical issues due to my weight and even though I got close to slipping into EDs as a kid (and even today I probably don't eat the way a \"normal\" person should), I don't actively work to lose any weight today since I was and am pretty comfortable with it now. Recently, I've been a lot more active (mainly due to switching jobs and doing something more physically demanding for the first time in my life) and I've started to lose quite a bit of weight, even though I haven't rlly changed my diet at all. I know the guidelines say not to mention numbers so you'll just have to imagine. \n\nNow my issue is that although I can feel the positive effects of it (I don't get exhausted as quickly, my feet don't kill me after just a small walk) and I see the numbers on the scale and the way my clothes don't fit like they used to, the person looking at me in the mirror still looks exactly the same to me. People around me (especially my mother) are praising me because \"you got so thin\" and \"you look so nice\" and frankly, it's scaring me. Not just because I can't see what they claim to see but cuz I just feel like I'm doing something wrong. Like I'm betraying someone (myself?) \n\nI don't know why that is and I don't know how to combat that feeling and it's just been gnawing at my brain these last few months and I can't handle this alone anymore. Why does my brain want me to be \"\"unhealthy\"\"? \n\n",

On my priv i have a tw in my bio and my pinned post is a lengthy thread of the different topics i post which include mentions of eating disorders and emotional stuff. I let all my followers who request that they can leave at any time and i will not take it personally. However last week when i quoted a ed related post one of my mutuals (20F) got angry and told me to pack in my fat phobia and self hatred and to stop posting about shit like that. I got upset and told her that my private account was there for me to post unapologetically and that if she had an issue she is free to leave, this resulted in her getting upset and saying that im fat phobic and that she doesn’t feel comfortable being associated with me if i so obviously do not like people who “look like her”. I assured her that I’ve never looked at her or anyone else with distain because of their appearance and that she was confusing the nature of my disorder. But she didn’t agree and said that the way i talk about body images goes hand in hand with plus sized hate and that i need to fix myself before I lose everyone close to me because of it. Since then we have stopped contact and ive removed her from my private and main account.\n \n\nWas i in the wrong for posting about my disorder on my private account? ",

        "Text": "Title says it all — I feel triggered every single time I exercise. I have been trying to meet the recommended daily exercise goal set by most dietitians/GPs of 30-60 minutes a day. This is usually either a long walk outside weather permitting or a session on the stationary bike, but I’ve also experimented with weightlifting and pilates. However, as someone who exercised excessively as a part of their ED in their teens, I find I’m getting triggered every single time I finish a workout. If I’m not explicitly comparing myself and my progress to my disordered years, I just get in a negative slump and feel even more discouraged about my overall goals. It makes it really difficult to push through and get moving and it doesn’t even feel like the exercise is worth it because I feel worse afterwards. Does anyone else feel this way? Like where are my endorphins 😭",

        "Text": "Hi! Apologies in advance if this is triggering and feel free to take it down, but just wondering whether anyone else has had/made it through this experience. For a couple of years now, I’ve been periodically getting days where I have this awful empty/“achy” pain all over the space under my ribs and especially right below the bottom of my sternum. It feels kind of like hunger but doesn’t go away no matter how much I eat (even when I follow my whole meal plan, which I do consistently, and eat to the point of feeling sick). Going for a walk sometimes makes it go away, which makes me think it might be GERD or indigestion or something, but I’m on limited exercise right now, so that’s not really an option anymore 😔 I read online that it could be an odd presentation of GERD, and I was also considering gas because I know that can feel like hunger pangs sometimes, but I’m not sure how to figure that out for sure. If it’s relevant at all, it only happens when I don’t sleep enough and am feeling exhausted/sleep-deprived.\n\nAnyway, obv not asking for medical advice, but I was just wondering whether anyone else has experienced the “pseudo-hunger”/indigestion thing and, if so, what you do about it. For the record, I’m committed to fueling my body and following the meal plan I’ve been given, so this is not me trying to avoid food; it just feels hard to eat on the days when doing so doesn’t make any dent in the physical discomfort and sometimes even seems to make it worse. I’m used to feelings of bloating and fullness, but this is different. Just curious whether it’s ever happened to anyone else or whether my body is just unique in this. Thank you!\n\n",

        "Text": "I'm a 15 year old boy struggling with an undiagnosed eating disorder, I have no interest in recovery right now. I have a boyfriend who has had anorexia for a bit over 6 months now. Back in the summer when his eating began to get really bad he told me a few things regarding my eating habits. He pointed out how my ribs make him really triggered. Some quotes from him on that day: \"Ribs shouldn'tbe showing on a normal human???\" and \"Why do you get to be tall and small? I want to too\". As you can maybe see, those words were really insensitive even for someone who also struggles with weight. I've always been skinny while he's on the bigger side. It's not like i necessarily want to be small, I've just never eaten enough. He's thrown comments like this at me after that night too. I'm just wondering if anybody here thinks it's even a bit justified that he said all that knowing that I've been struggling with an ED for years. I get that anorexia makes people do and say dumb things, but considering that he claims he loves me over anything it feels a tad weird that he said that even in the heat of the moment.\n\nAddition: I'm safe, I have recources for recovery and help. I know what I'm doing and I'll get help as soon as I feel even a bit like recovering. Stay safe everyone!",

        "Text": "\n\nHi everyone, I have been trying to lose weight for the past four years of my life growing up. My mom turned to food for emotional reasons. She raised me and my sister having a love for food and comfort for food.\n\nGrowing up, I realized that I can’t blame her for continuing to make unhealthy choices for myself.\nPerhaps I grew up in that environment, but I know she isn’t to blame.\n\nI live with my boyfriend now of three years, who is a boxer, and who enjoys working out and being healthy. He’s my biggest supporter and is always trying to push me to do better, and make better choices so that I can be happy and healthy.\n\nMy issues are the following: I am constantly thinking about food and about what I’m going to eat today and tomorrow. I love junk food and eating out and if I have to eat home-cooked food, I get sour pissed off and upset. I wake up thinking about what I’m going to eat today so that I can set my mood and be happy. Late at night before I sleep, I imagine all of the food I wish I could devour. Today I gave in to those thoughts and ate at work. I ate junk food as a way to prove to myself that it’s not worth it. I always get to a point where I allow myself to over eat and indulge the day before starting a strict diet.\n\nI constantly lie about how much food I eat to my boyfriend. I’ll lie about the water that I didn’t drink and the food that I didn’t eat and I’ll eat alone in my car and make sure that I get rid of the garbage like it’s evidence. When I choose to eat bad, I feel ashamed and guilty, lonely, and confused. I regret it immediately and sometimes I don’t which also scares me. \n\nThis year I have done a three day water fast four times. I have this mentality of it’s either all or nothing and I can’t find any balance in doing this. I’ve never seen a therapist or have been diagnosed. I’m hoping someone can give me advice on how to deal with my situation. \n\nI’m not obese I don’t feel ugly, but I know that I am out of shape and it sucks to feel like I can do better, but I just don’t have the mental strength to do it. Everytime I eat in secret my  self esteem sinks. Lying to my boyfriend about what I eat makes me feel like a loser.\n\n",

I’ve been officially diagnosed with a binge-restrict eating disorder and it’s basically ruled my whole life. I’ve had 3 kids and after my 3rd I’ve been stuck in the binge stage for soooo long (they are 2 now) The only thing that’s changed is I reached out and told people. \n\nI told my midwife who was able to get me therapy. I told my husband and I told a friend at the gym. \n\nMy therapist was no help. She basically said that because my weight was stable they weren’t concerned. \n\nMy husband once used it against me in an argument. He was upset because I didn’t want to go out for lunch. He later apologised but overall I felt like I should be making food choices to keep him happy rather than what I actually want. \n\nMy friend at the gym was lovely but ever since I’ve felt like I was lying. I’m of average weight so I feel like I’m making it up. \n\nBasically all these things make me feel like I’m being watched all the time. Watched and judged. “She said she has an eating disorder but she looks normal” “she ate x yesterday why won’t she eat y today”. \n\nI think unless someone experiences it they don’t understand so when I want to talk or vent about it I’m left feeling unheard. I hate that I feel the way I do. I hate being stuck in the binge stage so much. I wish I’d never told anyone. It felt better when it was just me and I didn’t feel like anyone else was watching me. I don’t think I’ll talk about it anymore. Go back to talking online anonymously. I also feel like I’ve made it all up. \n\nI should mention, my mum often suspected I had an ED and even if she wasn’t able to get me the right help she did try. I’m saying this just to say, if someone was really watching they’d notice. I just wish I’d never said it out loud. ",

In the past year, I have gained some weight, which though it may not be that noticeable to others, has significantly impacted my self-worth and desire to interact with others. I’ve always been an introvert, but I used to push my self to do more things. I did my school trivia club, wrote and directed plays, etc. Over the past year, I’ve dropped all of that, and now I feel most comfortable when I’m hiding in the washroom stall. \n\nOne of these last things from before that I’ve still been involved in is a youth theatre troupe in my neighborhood. It’s directed by a great older couple who sacrifice many hours to organize it and donate the proceeds to charity. A month ago, I agreed to join my fourth play with them. Due to some scheduling, I was only supposed to attend my first rehearsal this morning and hadn’t thought too much about it. But this morning, I was thinking about how the last time they saw me I was a lot skinner, and I just wanted to HIDE. \n\nThis all happened about half an hour before I was supposed to leave, and I told my parents I would send an email explaining. My parents were appropriately irate, and said it was pathetic to drop my commitments in that way. They said I should explain myself in person. My mom said I had a terrible habit of hiding from responsibility. My dad said I was perilously close to being a piece of shit. \n\nIn the end, they couldn’t convince me. The email is sent and I’m a piece of shit. I’m not sure what the point of writing this is, except maybe that someone will understand. \n\nI’d like to feel bad, but really I just feel numb. It’s funny how little things matter when you don’t think you are worthy.  ",

So i dont think i have an eating disorder as my behavior changed rapidly and i think it takes years to develop an eating disorder but my eating is definitely disordered ive always been an extremely overweight kid, that along with other things have made me have some pretty bad body image and self esteem issues ive also been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety as well as borderline personality disorder, i have panic attacks quite often. About a year ago i attempted suicide and failed since i was released from the phych hospital my eating habits have taken over my life it feels like, i dropped out of high school, im unable to go out in public without someone else and even then not for long, i cant eat in front of other people it makes me feel such shame and like the most disgusting person imaginable, and when i do eat i cant make myself eat much as before, almost all of my calories come from liquids such as soda and monster because im able to do my best and ignore the numbers on the cans  😅  ive lost a considerable amount of weight in a short amount of time i dont believe its a concerning amount but my family have noticed and comment on the difference when i do try and eat more solid foods i panic and have to purge (which i HATE doing it makes me feel extremely unclean) im incredibly scared of getting ill from eating solid food 😅  so for my second question before we get to my main problem! I realize how quickly this could turn into a full blown eating disorder and that really scares me!!! ive been trying my best to hide it from my family but i wanna get help but im not sure how to go about it? Some advice would be very appreciated!!! Now onto my main problem... my grandma i love her so much and i go over there every sunday to do her laundry and visit with her for a couple days because shes disabled and unable to leave her home but when i go over there she CONSTANTLY talks about my weight and the amount of food that i eat going so far as to force me to eat what she calls a \"healthy amount\" and showing me old pictures of myself when i weight more ​i panic VERY VERY BAD at being forced to eat, my grandma is someone who believes that men cant have eating disorders and that mental illness is just being weak when i had my suicide attempt she told me to get over myself and that i need to grow up and stop being so selfish. I cant just stop seeing her i love her and shes important to me but if i cant figure something out im just going to have to stop seeing her entirely that whould suck because shes one of the only people i see ever so if you have any advice than that would be very very very much appreciated!!!!

I know it’s because she’s deeply worried and it comes from a place of love, but it makes me cry, which only makes the situation worse, as she then resents me for crying.\n\nEvery meal with her is a real ordeal. She tries to force me to eat more, and when I can’t, she sighs and ignores me. She asks me to explain why I’m not eating and why things have gotten worse again after improving, but I truly have no idea, so I can’t explain.\n\nShe already has so much on her plate. Her job is extremely stressful and unfulfilling, and I feel so guilty about adding to her burden. But I feel like I can’t help it, even though I really want to.\n\nToday, we’re leaving in the late afternoon and will arrive late. I asked her what she wanted to do for dinner, and she slapped me (gently, it didn’t hurt at all), then said it wasn’t her meal but our meal.\n\nSo, my question is: how can I prevent anorexia from damaging my relationship? How do you keep your bond despite your ED? Are you able to manage this in your own relationship?\n\nSorry for the long post, and thank you so much to anyone who reads this.",

I didn't pick apart my body for the first time. I had a moment where I liked the way I looked but after a week, I hid it. And now I feel stupid for posting it at all. I even find Facetime hard to do and it's something my relatives love doing (a lot of them live in another country, so it's the only way we can see each other outside of photos) and I can see their disappointment every time I don't turn on the camera.

This has developed over the past few years to a more severe degree but I’ve always been a picky eater.  But more recently I can only eat certain things and I crave them so not eating them would throw off my day.  One is a lunch order I get everyday empanadas beef x2 and a Nutella peanut butter one.  Then steak and potatoes for dinner every night.  A smoothie for breakfast pretty large with açai fruit juice and protein powder.  That’s pretty much my diet as of the last six months.  It will vary occasionally with chicken nuggets or pizza.  Lots of sweets too which is what I am mostly hungry for.  But for example I also might change the empanadas to a tuna sandwich which then I would get that everyday for however long that continued.  I often deem food contaminated if it’s past a certain time I assess to it depending on appearance or a thought of it just being something I know I can no longer eat so I am forced to throw away perfectly good foods.  I can’t get myself to want to cook or learn about food it is just so consuming to me how often we have to eat and how much energy we put into it.  I have had some similar issues back in college thinking I was wasting valuable study time eating all the time (3 meals) I practically stopped eating and got to a very bad point with my weight and health in general.  I think the last few years something kicked in high gear and now foods I enjoyed before no longer are food I can eat or want to eat.  Like Chinese or seafood.  I feel nauseated from the texture of the chicken and if anything the first few bites might be ok but I can’t actually eat it because I’m so overly concerned about the taste and texture and quality.  Similarly with Japanese or seafood.  I just realized this was actually an eating disorder tonight stumbling across it.  I am in shock because my sister assigned it to me being bi polar and fixating on things but seeing this I think it’s a little bit more than a fixation.  ",

After a breakup in 2021, I began eating a lot and gained quiet a lot of weight. I started going to the gym, mainly just for mental health reasons and because I wanted to bulk up a bit. Lost a bit of weight and was getting quiet lean. Loved the muscling up. \n\nHowever, during stressful times (minus the post breakup) I tend to lose my appetite and forget to eat (due to adhd). I'm a university student in a pretty stressful program, working part time, and managing a lot of therapy and life changes. I've recently started vyvanse which obviously makes this issues worse, but at this point, I cannot trade out vyvanse because it's literally helping me function in my day to day, and other adhd meds didn't really do much if anything for me. Im at a point where my body is used to feeling empty, and ive lost quiet a bit of weight over the last year. I want to eat, I love food, but im never hungry, and I never have an appetite or a desire to cook. I'd order fast food to counter this but i cannot afford that all the time. \n\nThings I have tried: \n-Protein shakes (especially in AM cuz cortisol spike makes me nauseous when I try to eat)\n-Light work outs (to stimulate appetite)\n-Comfort foods (grilled cheese, soup, mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, ice cream)\n-Adding in snack foods (fruits, granola bars etc) \n-Meal prep (to help have options ready for later in week)\n-Making lunches for every shift/university day\n\nAny help or suggestions or anything is super appreciative.

I would like to invite you to take part in my research study as part of my PhD dissertation, which concerns cognitive factors/traits in relation to psychological traits and eating behaviors. This study involves the use of completely anonymous clinical instruments that assess autistic traits and eating behaviors. If you agree to participate in my research, I will ask you to complete 2 assessments via a Qualtrics questionnaire. The session will begin with a brief participant demographic survey to ensure diversity of results and will be followed with the administration of the subsequent assessment measures. The first instrument to be administered consists of questions regarding psychological traits. This will be followed by a brief questionnaire which will assess eating behaviors. We do not require any official diagnoses nor age restrictions, but we want to gather a diverse range of responses to ensure the study results are applicable to a wide range of people. We are mostly interested in evaluating how different cognitive traits may affect eating behaviors in order to increase the effectiveness of treatment for individuals with different cognitive profiles.\n\nClick the Qualtrics link below for more information and to access the survey. Clicking the link does not mean that you must complete the study. Once provided with further information, you will be offered the chance to consent to participate but may deny consent or choose to discontinue whenever you please. This study was approved by the IRB/ethics committee at Pace University.\n\nPlease note, if you have come across this survey elsewhere, please only take the survey once.

All of the threads and articles I found don't give satisfactory information\n\nSo I obviously have an eating disorder. After being really sick, I fixed it with easy to digest foods like chocolate. Now I'm a bit stuck. I did it for a year and almost doubled by body weight. That was good. I was really sick, and I wss thankful for that. Honestly, I'm thankful to some extent because I've tested the theory that my 'metabolism' is back to normal. The weight gain is happening really slowly so I have time, but it's getting to the point where every little bit counts.\n\nBut now it's too much, and I'm not saying this from an anasognosia perspective. I'm almost back to the weight I was during my BED flip-flop. Health problems etc.\n\nI do like real meal food. I can't eat a lot of it because of trauma from that illness I talked about, but I can eat 'enough' of it. Problem is, sometimes I fall back on that old diet because, ya know, we like routine. I'm talking triple the amount of [redacted] that I should be eating just to maintain. I'm struggling really bad. \n\nThe days between have spaced out a bit, but it's not enough. It's slowing the weight gain down.

For the past 18 years, I have been prescribed Adderall for ADD, but even when my ADD symptoms went away and my medication didn’t work for me anymore, I stayed on it because it helped me stay super thin.\n\nAs the years went on, the Adderall made me bipolar and manic. Eventually (about three months ago really,) I decided to finally end the Adderall abuse because it was ruining my life, all so I could be thin. I decided to choose happiness instead.\n\nUnfortunately, I have gained weight back, and I now have a tummy and love handles growing when I used to be super thin. I am much happier than I was when I was on Adderall (i was super paranoid, manic, and I would lose jobs like it was my job, which is weird since it’s supposed to make me productive, but it stopped working) \n\nAnyway, I don’t know how to accept my body at a healthy weight while looking out of shape. \n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar experience and have any advice they can share? 💖",

Coming to my brother, from past one year he isn't eating normally, he eats so less compared to what he used to, every time my mom cooks anything that has oil or sugar, he gets so upset and frustrated. He tries to avoid everything that has sugar or oil in it, not in a healthy way but in a very unhealthy and stressed way. He avoids drinking water so much. And even in what he eats, he tries to keep it minimal too. He doesn't give care about nutrition or protein or vitamins, no no no all he tries to do is eat and drink water as less as possible. Growing up he was overweight, in childhood people around him including me used to stay stuff like \"stop eating so much, you're gaining so much weight\", obviously I was a kid back then as well, I had no idea if it could leave affect him, and unfortunately neither did the adults around him. I recently realized this is very clear signs of ed. I've tried talking with him to \" start eating normally \", ik that's not how it works but i did and as expected I realized talking or saying won't work. I have to take him to mental health therapist or psychiatrist/psychologist. What steps do I take from here. I'm very concerned about my brother, I want him to be okay and healthy. Pls help us.",

So at the beginning of this year I  (33) relapsed into anorexia/orthorexia which led to me losing my period. Atm I am really trying to eat more and put on some weight, but I know, that I probably still do not have enough body fat for my menstrual cycle function normally again. However I started to have recurring bladder infections and I heard that this could be caused by low oestrogen levels, as this leads to the weakening of bladder mucosa and generally makes the urogenital tract more susceptible to infections, which is apparently a common problem in menopause (for which I am too young obv.). \n\nI remember I had a lot of bladder and UTI issues back when I was also underweight, but this problem disappeared over time as I was coming back to a normal weight. However, I never thought about this having to do with my ED and I am just now starting to wonder, if this could be correlated. \n\nHas anyone else experienced the same? Or does anyone have any tipps on how to improve hormonal balance (besides committing even more to  recovery and weight restoration)?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers!",

I couldn't bring myself to eat any of the vegetables in the stir fry and was incredibly embarrassed when someone pointed it out to me.\n\nFor years I've had an issue where I can't eat a lot of foods because my body physically rejects it. I convulse at best, vomit at worst. I had considered an eating disorder about 5 years ago but my mum told me that I've always been like this and so it's probably not an eating disorder. It's also important to note I'm autistic so my food aversion has always just been bundled with my autism\n\nAfter this embarrassing dinner, I went home and tried to look up advice on what to do about this situation, looking mainly for autistic guides. Maybe some things to help me even just swallow the foods or some advice on how to get around these situations (how to hide it better or what). A medical article about ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) popped up and I read through it. I'm honestly concerned with how much I relate to it, though it's not a 100% match.\n\nI'm not diagnosing myself, I will go and get an official diagnosis but my budget right now is extremely tight to the point where I'm barely able to pay my regular bills. When I get a bit more money I will, but I wanted to ask for some advice until I can get that diagnoses. Even if I don't have ARFID, there is still something wrong with my relationship with food. I'm not in a dangerous spot with it (which is hugely why I've never sought help before), but I'm also keenly aware I'm not *healthy*\n\nIf anyone can point out what kind of information I should give to get advice or just has some general advice, please guide me. I'm really embarrassed and ashamed, and I really do want to resolve this issue.",

I went through some periods of relapsing/recovering since I was 17 but recently I relapsed harder than ever and I’m at my lowest weight rn, but I’m barely underweight. That makes me feel like I don’t have an ED and that I don’t deserve therapy or recovery since I’m not “really struggling “. But I do struggle, a lot. I’ve been suffering for my whole life. \n\nA recent thing that my mind thought was that I will allow myself to go to therapy and try to get a proper diagnosis once I reach a certain weight. I think this is related to a past experience where a therapist I used to go to forced me to weigh myself in front of her after I told her that I suspected that I had an ED. When she saw I was at a healthy weight she told me \"you're okay\" and never brought up the issue again. I feel like I need to be really underweight to deserve a diagnosis. A friend told me that all of this is my ED trying to convince me to lose more weight, but I don’t know.\n\nAm I gaslighting myself? ",

        "Text": "This is a long one so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. \n\n\nI’ve been struggling with food for many years, caught in a relentless cycle of restricting and overeating. Some days, I hardly eat at all, but by the end of the day, I’m so hungry that I binge. This leaves me feeling painfully full, which only pushes me to restrict again the next day, and the cycle repeats. It’s exhausting.\n\nI’ve completely lost my ability to sense hunger or fullness. I honestly don’t know if I’m hungry anymore, and when I do eat, it’s usually too much. My body feels totally out of sync—my period has become irregular, starting again just after a week, I’m getting constipated, and I’m pretty sure my metabolism is screwed up from this constant swinging between starving and overeating. I feel stuck in a body I don’t feel comfortable in.\n\nI desperately want to be connected to my body: eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full, but it feels impossible. My mind is always consumed with thoughts about food. Every single day is spent worrying about what I’ve already eaten, what I’m going to eat next, how much I should eat. It’s even worse when I have plans to go out—if I know I have a dinner coming up, I’ll try not to eat anything all day just to \"save room.\" Even when I make healthy choices, I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt, as though eating anything at all is wrong. And that guilt intensifies after I binge or eat something “unhealthy.” It’s like I’m trapped in a never-ending battle with food, where I constantly feel bad for eating, no matter what or how much.\n\nWhat frustrates me most is that, despite all this, I’m not losing weight (which is how it all started, I wanted to be skinnier). I wish I another ed, like anorexia, because then at least I’d be skinny. \n\nOne of the hardest parts is my obsession with finishing food. When I buy something—whether it’s a bag of cookies, chips, bread, or croissants—once I open it, I feel this compulsion to finish the whole thing. Even when I’m full or not enjoying it anymore, I keep eating because the idea of leaving it unfinished feels unbearable. I hate that I do it, but I just can’t stop. If things are individually wrapped, I’m fine—I’ll eat one cookie and stop. But with a full package, I feel like I have to get rid of it by eating it all, so I don’t have to think about it anymore or feel guilty about buying it in the first place. The crazy part is, the next day I’m able to do exactly the same (buy another pack of cookies because I crave something sweet and eat it all in one sitting. again) \n\nI just want to know if anyone else has gone through something similar, especially with the packaging issues, and if there’s a way to break free from this endless cycle.

Having to prepare the food, actually put it in my mouth to chew it, then clear the table, and wash dishes. I just find it to be too much. Even if I have someone else helping me make food and cleaning them, I just find it to take so much of my time. I hate the process of having to chew food since I often start gagging on it. Additionally, I'm deemed a picky eater since there are limited amounts of food I actually enjoy the taste of and one wrong texture can make my appetite turn upside down. I say enjoy the taste of since, as stated before, I hate the process of actually eating. I'm posting on here looking for support to be able to overcome this obstacle. I would love to gain weight and start going to the gym as well as grow taller in the time I have. I've tried drinking supplemental drinks but I just can't bring myself to finish a whole bottle. Every motivation I've tried for myself has quickly been diminished as I just can't keep up with my goals. \n\nI think a part of this might have something to do with how I've been brought up. I've always had to eat with my family, which can sometimes get problematic, finish my entire plate before leaving or things like my internet could get turned off. If I try to eat alone my family makes bad remarks in front of me and overall makes me feel horrible. I have to eat at the same time as them or my internet gets shut off once again. I think because of them, I feel like eating is so forced and I hate it. But even when I'm at school and able to eat on my own time I still can't bring myself to eat more than just a few bites.",

I am very picky with what I eat and struggle with foods outside of carbs, fats and meat, people have always just said I was a picky eater but I think it is more than that.\n\nI am 26 now and when I was 14-16, I only have photos to go off of but I was quite a bit under the 'ideal' weight for my age and now I am over.

When I was a teenager my depression/anxiety made my appetite go away almost entirely, and as I had body dysmorphia and a father who encouraged restricting, I never ate enough. I was cold and weak all the time.\n\nWhen I graduated high school I started new medication and it was like a switch flipped. It increased my metabolism and hunger beyond what would be my natural appetite. I gained weight and for a while it felt good to have energy, stay warm, and keep my body nourished.\nBut it’s gotten past the point of what I’d weigh if I could eat intuitively and it’s triggering both my body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria (as I can’t hide my body as well now in clothes.) \n\nI’m hungry all the time and never feel satisfied no matter how much I eat. I try to eat all the major food groups/make sure I’m getting enough calories but it doesn’t matter, and if I don’t eat past what’s comfortable I wake up starving in the night and can’t get back to sleep, and it doesn’t help that it’s hard to eat to keep my appetite sated with my limited range of safe foods from autism.\n\nI talked to my psychiatrist and he’s suggested we try replacing the medication but I don’t want to go through months of adjusting to a new medication when I’m doing very bad mentally, and it’s a very important medication for me to be able to function so I can’t just stop it.\nSo I’m left trying to find ways to fix it or cope, but any tips I’ve find online would send me spiraling and I know it. I thought I would ask for any advice here as support groups are the only place I can think of that might understand. Thank you for your time either way.",

I am a girl, with no job, and little support at home. I usually don't eat breakfast (unless forced by my mom, which I stall immensely and eat very slow) I rarely eat lunch, it's not that my school lunch is bad, or that I don't want to eat, I just hate eating with other people. I haven't eaten lunch for more than a week in about 6-8 months. I eat dinner, but I hate it sometimes because my family eats really late and I have a rule (for myself) when I can't eat after 9 or 10 pm. I eat snacks at times, but normally they are by myself. There have been a couple occasions where I didn't eat for 1-2 days, or lied about eating when I actually hadn't. Also, sometimes whenever I finally get the courage to eat breakfast or lunch I only ever take a couple bites because I over estimated my hunger. I hate eating in restaurants or in front of family, it scares me. I just hate being looked at and evaluated while I nourish myself. My mental health also isn't good, so that doesn't help. \n\nI genuinely think I'm fine, but like I said, I've had friends worried about me, but I don't wanna worry about it unless people tell me I need to worry. If it helps, I have had suicidal ideations, and have cut myself. I was about 4 months clean two days ago, but this weekend was hard for me, and I ended up relapsing. My family doesn't know about it, but I used to be in therapy with my brother because of family issues. I went to therapy once last year, but my dad did most the talking. ",

I caught myself saying things I haven't said since high school all while being terrified of gaining any weight. But that fear is rooted in not getting that surgery that would change my life. It feels like a damned if ya do, damned if ya don't kind of situation. Gotta lose weight, but gotta do it right; how to do it right is all skewed and blurry now. I need to do this for medical reasons, but it's drifting into doing it for non medical reasons again. I was happy bigger and I'm proud of getting genuinely healthier. I like myself. If I keep going I can go on the table and get gender affirming surgery paid for by my insurance.

(That's what you're supposed to do right?) But it's hard to tell what's the \"right\" full, what's too much and what's too little to where I'll have to eat more? Either way the weight of my food pulls at my heart. Years ago I'd already be starring down the toilet bowl, hands shaking, throat on fire. Praying no one hears me..I know they did. But..I promised myself I'd never do that again. I'd never hurt myself in that way again. Sure I've had some bad day's, like right now. All I can do is remind myself that each time I resist the urge to purge I get stronger and my love for myself grows. Even if I feel disgusting right now..ik how I'd feel if I'd gone through with it. Ik it would start a new cycle of compulsive self-abuse. My mind and body would be completely ruled by it all over again. So..for right now I'll sit outside on the grass and allow my belly to feel full, allow my body to absorb the nutrients from my food, and I'll hold myself with love and compassion knowing how strong I am for recovering...I'll thank myself for not purging. I'll  breathe as the feeling in my gut and the itching in my throat subside. The clouds will pass by and the birds will chirp. I'll get hungry again, I'll eat again..maybe next time I won't feel this way..maybe next time I will. But I know I can go and sit outside again..and breathe.\n\nTo all of you who are in a similar pattern in recovery know that YOU ARE WORTH IT, YOU ARE STRONG AND YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!

        "Upvotes": 152,
        "Text": "So as the title says, I broke up with my girlfriend (31) of 3 years. She told me that she suffers from eating disorders about a year into our relationship, but that she is fine now. She actually was hospitalized because of it in her teen years. We moved in together after a year or so. I must confess that I didn't take her condition seriously at first and she said she was fine now so I guessed she's cured. Several months have passed with us living together and I had to go on a restrictive diet because of my health. I wasn't overweight but had some other medical reasons for which was suggested to me to try this diet. Little did I know this triggered her disorder in a major way. When I said I'm skipping breakfast one day because we didn't have anything that I could eat, she exploded and told me \"how could you say this to me?\". I was left in awe because, in my mind, I wasn't doing anything to her. That's when she started to not eat and loose weight. When I came off of my diet, things got better again and we didn't talk about it anymore. Fast forward another year, she was triggered again by some problems in our relationship that had nothing to do with food but with her insecurities and jealousy (which was totally unfounded). This time she didn't tell me anything, just started to loose weight. She lost a lot of weight and everyone was telling her how skinny she's looking. I was telling her that she's too skinny and should eat more, but her response was always \"I'm not hungry\". ..\n\nShe and I both like parties and hanging out with friends which usually involves alcohol. Because now she was not eating enough, alcohol would really kick in faster and harder and she would get into these awfully destructive states. She would either cry or take it out on me calling me names, that I'm in love with somebody else, that I'm boring and she doesn't want to hang out with me and stuff like that... She was unrecognizable to me. Every time, the next morning, she would apologize and say that she doesn't know why she said all those things and that she loves me and wants only me for the rest of her life... Our relationship was pretty good (the best I had so far) when she was sober, but every now and then, she would get drunk and have these dramas that I didn't understand and quite frankly was getting tired of... These dramas became more frequent and I started to loose interest in her and spending my life with someone who tortures me like that was beginning to scare me. On the last incident, she not only insulted me, but threw stuff at me at a party in front of other people. I ended it that night. Of course, when she got sober, she said she didn't mean it and that she has a problem and would seek help again (she already went to therapy, but left because she was not satisfied with the therapist). When I mentioned that she should stop drinking all together, she said \"That won't happen....\". So I decided to leave which crushed her emotionally... It was really hard for me too (and still is) because I still care about her and see how good of a person she could be, but I couldn't stay and watch her taking it all out on me and basically saying \"This is the way it's going to be and I won't do anything about it. If you love me, you'll stand by me...\"\n\nAfter I moved out, I spoke to a friend of my now ex and said that she has a problem with eating disorder and alcohol and I asked her to wash out for her. I kind of doubt anything has changed because she's been going out until dawn every weekend since we've broke up. I'm suspecting that a lot of alcohol is involved. So I'm worried she went on a self destructive path rather than the opposite way...\n\nIt's hard to even imagine what she is going through. Eating disorders are a completely unknown to me. So can anyone explain to me what is it about eating disorder and alcohol abuse? Is it possible that she literally transforms herself to a completely different person?\n\nWhat I'm questioning myself is \"does she really mean all that stuff she's saying drunk or is it some sort of combination of her mental problems and alcohol?\"\n\nAlso can you suggest a book that would help me to better understand the mind of a person with an eating disorder?\n\nThank you",

I always respond that I'm fine, that I eat good meals and it's not a problem, but I'm starting to wonder whether I'm maybe a bit in denial.\n\nI don't know what to do because I don't think I have an actual eating disorder, having experienced restrictive eating tendencies in the past and gotten better, but I do think that my relationship with food and my body is a bit complicated and perhaps could be negatively impacting my overall health.\n\nThe thing I feel quite lost about is that I literally just don't know how to change my very deep and unconscious \"addiction\" to being skinny, something that I saw my mother model for me growing up as she was always thin and didn't let us eat unhealthy foods, and also herself often ate small portion sizes. When I was a kid/teenager, and in adulthood, people have always complimented me on being skinny and implied that my body is desirable. Sometimes my self-esteem about my self-worth can be low in other ways and I feel like in some level I've always associated my low weight with positive reinforcement from the world so it feels so difficult to try and make myself eat more, especially as I'm ill with CFS atm.\n\nI'm not really expecting anyone to be able to solve things for me, I know I need to do it myself, but I was wondering whether anyone here could suggest helpful resources and techniques for starting to shift these mental patterns, which dont constitute a full blown eating disorder but a below the surface, not quite healthy, relationship with diet and body. \n\nThank you and love xx",

He was always skinny growing up, but during the pandemic he gained weight and was at a perfect size. \n\nHe, a little over a year ago, for some reason, just started to not eat his lunch at school, and would go to sleep to avoid eating. But eventually he'd pick back up and still eat something, so even though he lost some weight, it wasn't too bad.\n\nHe started high school in September. He hadn't been eating much during the summer, and now he definitely has been eating much lesser. No lunch, nothing, even though we're pleading with him to please eat. We think that maybe he's being bullied or made fun of, but he won't say anything. \n\nLast week, he got sick. Didn't eat that entire weekend, and just slept right through (understandable..He's sick). But now he's lost all the rest of weight he has, and his knee caps are now in plain sight. He looks absolutely horrible, and he thinks he looks much better than he did when he was \"fat\". \n\nIt's making me stressed out as an older sibling, because whenever he goes back out to school, or anywhere in public, they'd think that maybe we're starving him, or we're just really struggling at home. I just want him to eat. He doesn't see it, but it does not look good...at all. He's almost 6ft too. \n\nTried to get him to eat some soup last night, but he kept throwing a fit and went to sleep. Idk if my mom is taking as seriously as it's bothering me, but I just really need some advice. \n\nHe should be looking healthy for his birthday next month. How does he expect to focus properly in school, or through extra curricular activities if you're not nourishing your body properly???",

Yes, bad days happen, and yes, body dysmorphia prevails at times. Overall I live pretty healthy now. But the voice resurfaces STILL. Hard to avoid certain triggers in the world; people will make comments about their habits, that don't necessarily apply to MY situation, and I can handle it mostly. Lately though, these past demons have been louder. I find myself more paranoid if I'm eating too much or too late in the day...today I treated myself to a lunch outing and got myself an app AND bowl of grain, and suddenly I feel like a nasty glutton. \"Probably shouldn't have more later! People would think this portion was huge!\" Is this just \"The Thing That Shall Not Be Named\" leeching into my brain, or what the hell is going on? I haven't made any major life changes recently, I still have bits of depression here and there but nothing crazy. I've been more stressed and anxious about nothing in particular. Lately everything feels overwhelming and irritating and I can't figure out why. But these long dormant thoughts and \"feelings\" are resurfacing sneakily and that's what worries me. Especially after so long of a time being in the clear... Any input/advice/relating? FYI I really don't need urges to get \"treatment\". I know for a fact I'm not at that point again. I've been at much lower, darker points, and hardcore treatment is not what I secretly need. Just...some clarity. Or am I right in being paranoid? Am I eating more? Is it warranted? This SOB is a sneaky fucker and I want to shut it down. Thank you.",

        "Text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI’ve been diagnosed with gastroparesis for several months now, and it has progressively worsened. It’s almost certainly caused or at least contributed to by AFRID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), IBS, and extreme binge eating. Additionally, I’ve been using Ambien off-label for anxiety and pain, which might have made things worse. I’m unsure whether the gastroparesis was worsening before, leading to the pain and anxiety that Ambien temporarily relieved, or if both issues have been working in tandem.\n\nThis has gotten out of hand, and I’ll soon be entering a residential program where they can monitor my food portions while I also work on overcoming my dependence on Ambien, which I’ve been using as an off-label pain reliever.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, I’ve also been dealing with an irritable gallbladder and biliary dyskinesia for about a decade. I’ve had issues digesting fats, experienced floating stools, and often felt sluggish to the point of feeling ill. Now, I’m having episodes of burning, stabbing, and throbbing pain in my upper right quadrant, which fits in with the timeline of everything else. I’m convinced this is a comorbidity, and I want to address both conditions at the same time.\n\nAnecdotally, it seems that many people don't find improvements in their motility after gallbladder removal, but the wear and tear of keeping it seems no longer worth it. So, I am deciding to have it removed.\n\nI have two possible scenarios:\n\n1. I get the gallbladder removed, recover, and then go into the residential program.\n\n\n2. I start the residential program first and stick with low fat foods until I get my surgery after.\n\nI don’t want to delay the residential program, but the low-fat diet restrictions might be challenging. On the flip side, gallbladder surgery recovery could take up to six weeks, possibly longer, delaying my treatment for disordered eating. \n\nFor those who have been in a similar situation, what did you do?\n\nEdit: Gallbladder surgery and recovery then eating disorder rehab vs Rehab then surgery pro/cons",

She believes the process should have been slower and more gradual for proper anorexia recovery. Now, this has led to binge eating disorder, leaving her feeling frustrated and depressed.\n\nI really want to help, but I'm not an expert.

I even ordered a liquid collagen product online to help with my gut health, and I am going to start cupping my stomach, purchasing groceries with probiotics, etc., just so that I feel better. \n\nI don’t ever want to be skin and bones again, but I also dislike online shopping and seeing how many sizes I have to scroll through on a size chart just to find my proper measurements represented, which I think is more of a fashion industry problem than a “my body” problem. \n\nI don’t know if I have body dysmorphia, but I feel like my family forced those feelings onto me and that gave way to bullying in elementary and middle school, because I was a child who didn’t have autonomy over my diets. \n\nMy mom and her mother (the one who called me “chicken legs”) put me through a holistic health diet when I was 13 in a hippie cult clinic so that they could cure me of my autism. That definitely didn’t help my eating disorder path 😞.",

I’ve been in a restrict/binge cycle for so long. I’ve been restricting for a while and it caused me to be constipated and that’s the only thing that scared me, which sounds stupid but I have really bad emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so ANY issues related to my digestive system just make me really scared. I want to fix this so bad. I hate my body so fucking much. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I just wanna accept myself.

I cant focus during school, I cant fucking do anything. I am 14 and I hate the fact that my life is like this during my teenage years. My life already fucking sucks and my relationship is food is making it ten times worse. Please help me. What can I do to fix this? What can I do to stop binging? I’m so tired. Where do I start? ",

This was followed by returning home for the summer to find out my mom had turned into an almond mom. No carbs, low-fat dairy, using MyFitnessPal to track everything, the only snacks in the house were rice cakes and HaloTop.... I was miserable and it had some terrible effects on my relationship with food.\n\nOver the years I have started to break some of my disordered eating habits, but it has been a struggle as I have a lot of body dysmorphia from how my ED has changed my appearance. I try to go to the gym because I genuinely enjoy it and I want to be stronger, but I'm still so consumed by my appearance that it makes it hard to be there. I've been trying to increase the protein in my diet but trying to find recipes to support that goal just brings you to skinny/lean/\"guilt-free\" recipes sites that trigger me so eating to fuel my body while still enjoying food has been a struggle.\n\nMy husband works in mental health and has tried so hard to help me recover (along with working with my actual therapist) but some days are so bad I can't even make a meal plan without having a panic attack. I really want to be better but it feels like no matter how many things I change I always fall back into the same pattern: doing good, stressful trigger, binge to cope, restrict out of guilt, improve our of guilt, repeat.\n\nWhat strategies helped you recover?",

        "Text": "Not sure if this fits into the clinical definition of an eating disorder. My doctor used the phrase “post traumatic eating issues”\n\nI had food poisoning 3 weeks ago that was /really/ bad. I was vomiting every 15 minutes for several days, and I was vomiting so violently that I was spitting up blood. \n\nIt was honestly very very traumatic. I wanted to go to the hospital but I couldn’t get up from the bathroom floor. My wife was sobbing because she thought I was going to die and tbh I did too. I was so dehydrated by the end that my kidneys hurt. I was totally pale and passing in and out of consciousness at times. A lot of it I don’t even remember. \n\nI know it sounds silly, but I have never ever been so sick in my life and I was very sickly as a kid. So I really mean it, it was a traumatic experience that I never ever want to experience again. \n\nNow I’m better, I am not sick. But I have insane anxiety around eating. Any time the topic of food comes up (smells, commercials, meals, instagram posts) i lock up and get nauseous and begin to shake. \n\nPrevious to this, I had never experienced anxiety; so I really had no idea how to talk to healthcare pros. Today they finally figured it out, I’m not sick, I am anxious. I have a traumatic response to food that I am really struggling to overcome. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? I could really use even an understanding message that tells me I’m not alone. \n\nAlso I have a list of things to repeat to myself and do when I’m about to eat that help conquer my anxiety. If anyone is going through this, it may help. If there’s nobody out there like me right now, maybe someone in the future could use it. \n\n1. Anxiety is a response, not a reality. The anxiety I feel is a learned response from the trauma of sickness. \n2. It’s normal and okay to feel nervous after what I went through \n3. Hunger is a natural and safe feeling. It is good my body is reminding me it needs fuel. \n4. Have compassion for yourself. You are working on healing physically and mentally from the trauma. Progress might be slow but I am doing what I can and I need to be proud of myself.\n5. Acknowledge the texture, taste, and smell of food without judgement. I need to remind myself that food is safe to eat. \n6. Before eating, visualize eating without sickness and with enjoyment. \n7. Set goals for each meal. Maybe a number of bites or a portion of the plate. \n\n",

I am often anxious that the food will make me sick or make me need to use the bathroom in public so I just don't eat until I'm home. \n\nI do feel super low energy most of the time though and I often get dizzy (I also have POTS though). \n\nI like to think that I don't eat too much, even when I get super stressed and want to overeat, I would order a pizza and only eat like three slices. There are times when I actually overeat because of stress but that's only once or twice a month. \nI do have \"eating disorder\" written in my diagnosis but I don't even remember when I told my psychiatrist and it was never addressed in anyway, we don't talk about it at all. \n\nI am very heavy and I really want to lose weight. But I am depressed, lack motivation and I just can't keep up with actually counting my calories or anything. Also as I said, my problem is ironically undereating most of the time. \n\nI know that eating regularly helps and might be the sole reason I am not doing good at losing weight. How do I get myself to follow the schedule though? \n\nI feel like anytime I set alarms to eat regularly, at the end of the day I feel gross and fat and even if I manage to last a few days, I feel like I gained a hundred pounds by the end of it and end up being more sick, vomiting again and pretty much giving up because eating so often just makes me feel like I don't do anything but stuff my mouth.

My relationship with food has improved and I was at a healthy weight, however, today I went to get ready for an interview and discovered that none of my dress pants fit. \n\nI have worked hard the last couple months to embrace a positive mentality around weight gain, ie, buying clothes that fit rather than stressing about getting back into clothes that are too small, and I went shopping a couple months ago with that mentality, and now my pants don’t fit. I am struggling not to go into a bad headspace and implement old behaviours, so I’m here looking for advice from anyone who may have experienced a similar challenge.\n\nI know I’ve gained a little more than I’d like, so I would like to lose some of it, but in a healthy way. So I guess my question is, what tips do you have for preventing a relapse and feeling good about your progress?\n\nEdit: While I want to respond to everyone individually, I think it’s important to recognize that I’m sitting here crying because of the empathy and kindness from all of you. Thank you for all your comments.",

In the sense that I’m not concerned about the number on the scale nor am I counting calories or anything like that. The thing is though, I can tell I’m still quite underweight. \n\nThere was a period of time like maybe three years ago where I did restore a lot of weight back due to being on antipsychotics and I got to the highest I’ve ever been. It made me extremely distressed at the time and after I got taken off the medication I subconsciously fell back into restricting behaviours. \n\nNow I’m at a point where I genuinely want to gain weight because I don’t like how sickly I look, and I’m taking the right steps to do so, however I’m really nervous that once the eventual bloating happens I’m gonna clam up and regress back to old habits.

There was no time planned for buying anything in the meantime. \nSo I panicked and started running around to buy anything and shouted he should've bought anything himself. My fiancé got mad because that's not the first situation I was being kinda irrational or mean because of feeling a MILD hunger. I was not starving. \nOne thing is I want to loose weight and I won't do that until I learn to cope with hunger, and I don't want to be a jerk because of a minor discomfort. ",

I Decided to not tell her the truth truth, sugar coating it just saying “I just count calories, I don’t make myself sick or anything” (She’s seen me give my lunches away)\n\nAnyways in one session she suggested bringing it up with safe guarding and I was completely against the idea because I didn’t want my mum to find out.\n\nMid lesson I get pulled out by her and she explained that she told safeguarding and asked if I wanted to come with her to talk with the lady and I agreed.\n\nWe get there and a woman I’ve seen before who I don’t like is sat there. She’s talking to me basically telling me to tell my mum and stuff but I don’t know why but she made it sound like weird and like disgusting kinda?

We can either tell her or you can.” (I picked me telling her) “Right okay, But we’re going to call her to make sure.”\n\nAfter I left I wanted to disappear. I walked home a different route I had never used because I didn’t know if it would lead me home and I wasn’t thinking straight.\n\nAnyways my mums at work and I knew I couldn’t approach her with the situation, face to face so I texted her saying \n“Hii mum xx can we talk? Xx” She called me and I asked on phone if I could say it over text But she wouldn’t let me. I explained a little about what happened and she reacted well to it, she suggested talking when she’s back from work. By the end of the call I was in tears both happy and sad tears. She sent me a paragraph saying (this is copy and pasted)\n\nI love you so much. Nothing in this world would make me angry with you, unless you keep secrets. I know it’s hard to talk about your problems and struggles but I’m your mum, I want to help you and be there and support you.

I try to eat and live in a way that protects my hormones, because my mom, grandmother and several aunts all have been diagnosed with Hashimotos. \n(Though I haven't received any official diagnosis, I have experienced all the symptoms for hypothyroidism and/or Hashimotos.)\nI didn't really care about my appearance until 15, when I started to dance at a small ballet school, even at a very healthy weight I was still one of the heavier girls. I loved my appearance and where I was, and then I got married and pregnant at 18. \nNow I'm re-learning to love my body and my appearance but it's been very hard.\n\nMy current situation: I live with my partner in an in-law suite in his parents house, with no kitchen.\nhis family doesn't really plan for regular meals, and when they grocery shop it's \"here and there\" and there's no plan. Growing up and to this day my mom is very meticulous with meal planning and grocery shopping. every meal is planned for and there's always more than enough for everyone who lives there. Normally the only thing consistently at my partners house that I'm comfortable eating is eggs. \n\nMy partners mom, I'll refer to her as my MIL because I do love her deeply, a month after she met me, started using 💉 semi-glue-tide and made it her whole personality, and is constantly talking about her weight and comparing herself to me. She will buy herself new clothes every couple weeks and ask me what I think, and give me the old ones because \"they're too big so maybe they'll fit you\" and she'll point out her flaws and talk negatively about her body and all the areas I am ALSO insecure about. I've closed off completely from talking to her because it's just going to be \"guess how much weight I've lost\" or \"look at this new shake I got, look how little calories!!\"\n\nI'm finding it very hard to have a healthy relationship with someone who is using the shot when I have been trying to be healthier and manage my hormones for years with little progress or improvement.\n\nI've tried really hard to be supportive and let it roll off my back, but I've found myself getting on the scale every day and going to bed hungry, only eating once a day, If I see a higher number I have a terrible day and I cry when I look in the mirror, etc. \nI stopped weighing myself completely and am just trying to eat enough and eat healthy. \n\nI noticed my habits getting bad and my relationship with food starting to sour and I'm trying to correct it my environment and people I love are also making it difficult. \n\nI don't really know what to do anymore. I don't know what is healthy and what's not. I'm thinking of moving back in with my parents because their systems and relationships around food are a lot more healthy. \nI am open to any advice. ",

I lost a significant amount from first visit when they weighed me, and they never did again. I don't hide my body, and actually wear very revealing things that accentuate my body and all the signs. I mention overexercising, they think its good. Im on meds, it dosent help with my ed. Cant afford therapy.\n\nWhat should i do?

I gained weight naturally but I’m fine with it honestly. I don’t know how much I have gained because I don’t want it to affect me. I have put away some pants that are too tight. Since I started eating more and eating a more balanced diet, my mood has improved and I genuinely feel happier. \n\nHowever, recently in July I met with a friend who I haven’t seen since May. She said that I lost some weight. I was suspicious so I tried a pair of jeans that used to be a bit tight. Guess what, it feels loose. Now I’m freaking out. Idk why I lost weight. It was totally unintentional. I am still following the diet plan strictly and I thought I have been doing everything right. I talked to my dietitian but she only told me not to worry. I’m meeting my doctor but I need to wait till the end of the month. \n\nOne possible reason is that I generally more active in the summer because I walk my dogs. My dogs don’t like to go for long walks in winter when it’s cold. But other than that, nothing changes. I was doing weight training for a bit (twice a week, 45 minutes or so, as asked by my dietitian) last year in the winter. So when I gained the weight I also feel more muscles growing and I felt pretty good. But I kinda stopped it because I like to spend the time with my doggies instead. \n\nIs it normal to lose weight after a year into recovery?? Should I be worried? I am so anxious now. ",

I was always the “if you didn’t look so much like your mom we’d think you were adopted” kid in the family. I was the odd one out of all my cousins and the one in the family that only ate boneless meat and bread on holidays. I still am.. but it’s been getting harder... Everything tastes so weird now. Nothing tastes real. Food is so chemically processed or pumped with some kind of steroid these days and we’re not in the best situation financially to start growing and raising our own food so just doing it ourselves won’t work yet..\n\nI’ve started with little things but nothing that is going to really make much of a difference right now. \n\nI’m just not eating… I feel like it’s poison to my body eating and not eating and I feel sick half the time that I do eat. But I also feel sick when I don’t eat. I try to snack too because I know I’m not eating full meals everyday. I want to eat.. I try to be very mindful of what I’m eating and when I do go longer than I should without…. I don’t want to not eat. I just don’t know what to eat…\n\nBut… the older I get, the worse it gets. I thought it was supposed to get easier? I thought I would start liking more as I got older and tried things again or new things.

But I rly try to be understanding and when I say anything to try and help her it’s like I’m talking to a wall. I’ve asked her if she wants to get better and she said she doesn’t know, sometimes she wants to, sometimes she doesn’t. Which makes sense, I’m trying to quit nic rn so I get where she’s coming from. The other thing is she has rly bad self image and she has no reason to she’s already skinny enough by a long shot. and I sound like a parent rn but whenever she’s screensharing and she goes on twitter it’s always ed stuff and it makes her feel rly bad about herself because she’s constantly comparing herself. and My question is if I should just be quiet and wait for her to be ready to get better fully or if I should keep encouraging her to get better. Her self image has honestly affected our relationship I haven’t told her and I probably should, but she’s so much more fun to be around when I can tell she knows she looks good and is more confident and I feel like if she wasn’t comparing herself then she would feel like that more often.

Seeing so many share their stories and journey to recovery has been really inspiring - which is why i’m writing this. \n\nI have struggled with body image issues/ED’s since I was a teenager. I started with an obsession with calorie counting and an exercise addiction. This went on for a few years before I was able to move past the calorie counting, but the unhealthy relationship with the gym stayed. \n\nI then went to college, where I started smoking weed and binge eating. I was not comfortable purging the traditional way so I used laxatives. I’m not sure if my GP or therapist at the time helped me through this, but eventually it became hard for my body to be regular without the help of a laxative so I stopped. I would still binge but only with the caveat that I worked out the next day. \n\nA few years later down the line, I met my boyfriend. I was still working out pretty rigorously at first but I slowly became more comfortable and left the gym behind. I do remember gaining weight during this time, but not necessarily panicking that i needed to “do something” about it. \n\nNow that I am writing this all down chronologically im realizing where I really lost control is when I started working full time. I work retail, always have and always will. I left college and got my first full time management job about a year or so after my boyfriend and I started dating. I stopped working out because I didn’t have time or energy (if you work retail you know - it’s long days walking in circles) and started eating less. I found it hard to eat on my break sometimes as I was starting very early in the morning and wasn’t ready to eat by my 5th hour. (I have had an aversion to breakfast since a child) I ended up in the pattern I know so many of us are familiar with which is only having dinner. \n\nFast forward a few years and i’m still doing the same thing. I now have the fun added issue that food feels gross to me. I have no appetite, i’m grossed out by a lot of previous safe foods and I just do not want to eat. I can manage a few bites and then i feel full (or at least satisfied) and uninterested. \n\nAny advice on how to combat this while I search for a provider? I have had previous therapists tell me they aren’t “specialized” in EDs and won’t work with me on it. I have also reached out and submitted an inquiry for treatment with ERC. As i’m getting older i’m increasingly worried about what so many years of this has done to my body. Should I look into inpatient? \n\nSending everyone here so much love. We can do this. We can get better. ❤️‍🩹 ",

        "Text": "Hi Team,  \nEvery major challenge Ive tackled in the last decade Ive come to Reddit.  Please help with your experience & hope on this one:\n\n- I have a 17 yr trans daughter who we suspect has an ED.  \n- She has a history of depression & PTSD (diagnosed) that led to self harm & has been treated with no issues in the past year.  \n- Coming out of health care for the self harm, she was put on an anti psychotic & it caused weight gain.  She was at \"on track with weight\" and 5' 9\" & life was good.  \n- Shes been taken off the anti psych some time ago as it wasnt necessary.  Since then she has lost a lot of weight & has extreme difficulty putting on any weight.  She is now barely above \"hospitalize\".    \n- She is on estrogen & testosterone blockers.  This lack of weight bothers her greatly as she doesnt look any better or more like the woman she is.  \n- She talks openly about it, doesnt hide the behaviour & is trying to eat more & \"cant\".\n\nWe have her seeing:  \n- Therapist, psychologist, & a nutritionist (though not all at once).  \n- She has her trans doctor as well & on the regular.\n\nActions So Far:  \n- hi calorie diet  \n- Eat anything diet & snacks & ice cream & protien shakes  \n- tests done for other reasons:  her stool, blood & other tests.  All negative.\n\nQuestions:  \n1.  Is anyone else in this situation?  what did you do?  \n2.  Is this a bonafide eating disorder?  She cant eat enough food & finds many things gross, but in her own mind does not think she has a disorder.  \n3.  Pills:  Cyproheptadine (Periactin), does anyone have experience with them?  Since she gained weight fine when on the antipsychotic pill my brain says \"OK, the right pill will help her gain weight than\"  \n4.  Agressive Treatment:  What are the most aggressive things I can do to help her?    \nIt affects everything about her mental health & adds to already bad body dysmorphia.  Any & All help is appreciated.  We are flustered & need new help!",

My stomach actually feels raw. I binged yesterday too. I haven’t been able to get out of bed or do anything productive. Typically I’ve been really good at being productive, going to gym at 5am, then work, then class, but I haven’t gone to class at all, haven’t worked out, all I want to do is sit in my bed and stare at the wall. I feel like I’ve lost my purpose and that I don’t even know who I am anymore. I can’t even bring myself to go on a brisk walk. I’ve been sleeping at my friends house every night because I don’t want to be home around my roomates and be in my kitchen because it gives me anxiety. Eating around my roomates makes me so anxious and want to cry. I don’t even have motivation to conversate with them or hardly anyone besides my best friend (the one I’ve been sleeping at).  I had some tea this morning and took a smooth move tea last night to empty everything out to avoid puking. What should I eat today? I was thinking of taking a break from the gym for the rest of the week, but is that smart? I know recovery isn’t over night but how do I get out of the funk. My throat is hot because I’m constantly on the verge of tears and I feel actually nauseous. I scheduled an ED therapy consultation today to get a step in the right direction, but I don’t know what else to do. I feel lost, alone, and helpless. ",

        "Text": "Hey guys!\n\nI (21F) got into an extremely restricted diet this summer that lasted for approximately 3 months. I would consume about a quarter of the daily suggested calorie intake for humans (sometimes less bc if it was 7 PM I refused to eat if I didn't find something by or before that time) and I would excessively exercise with little to nothing on my stomach about every day or every other day.\n\nAfter a really severe period in the 3rd month, I decided to try to recover. And I've been managing by consuming about half that daily suggested intake (due to my height & still wanting to lose) per day or just staying within the suggested cal intake while keeping my exercise levels at about the same. But l've been noticing my metabolism clearly took a hit and has slowed significantly, plus I am bloated often + I can see the weight slowly creeping back on.\n\nI'm gonna be real - l've been morbidly obese most of my childhood and into my early adulthood, so I genuinely do want to lose weight and get to a healthier weight. But this weight slowly creeping back up on me is so discouraging I know that the typical advice for this is to cont. with eating healthy balanced meals each day paired with a normal amount of physical activity to recover & still achieve a healthy weight, but I'm scared that this process is going to go so slow, and the weight is gonna pile back up on me quicker that I can handle.\n\nFor anyone who has experienced a mild ED for a short period time like me, I know there isn't much damage l've done (hopefully) but what does recovery look like? I know everyone's body is different, but if the damage isn't that substantial is there any way I will return my metabolism back to normal to proceed with (healthily) losing weight?",

        "Text": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice regarding my never-ending battle with ED. It’s literally ruined my whole life and I don’t know how to fight it anymore. \n\nSo, I have had a bad relationship with food my whole life- ever since I was little, food has been my only solace. Whenever I felt sad or lonely, I’d turn to food and eat something even if I was completely full. This of course caused me to struggle with my weight. I was always overweight, even back at elementary school so I would get teased about it all the time. My family was no help as well, since they too would criticize me about my weight and encourage me to get in shape by means of humiliating me. \n\nIt’s no surprise I developed self-image issues. Because of this, I got stuck in a “starve yourself, lose weight and then gain it back in doubles” circle for the better part of my life. Finally, back in 2021, I hit a breaking point and decided to lose weight for good because I seriously hated how I looked. So I followed a strict diet and starved myself again for one year and a half and lost 30 kgs. I was elated, thought everything would be OK now that I’ve tackled the biggest problem of my life. I even maintained that weight for nearly a year but after a while the stress of university got the better of me and I started gaining weight rapidly. When this part of the circle begins, even though I’m very strong-willed regarding other aspects of my life like academic success, I lose all control. I know I’m doing something bad by over-eating and that I shouldn’t eat at the wee hours of the night but once I start I can’t for the life of me stop eating. \n\nNow, in 2024, I’m literally back at square one. I gained back all the weight I’ve lost and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried so hard to stop myself from going back to my old ways but I failed terribly and now I don’t know what to do. \nIt all seems so pointless to try and try only to lose all my progress at the end. \n\nHave any of you had this much of a setback regarding their ED? If so, how did you deal with it?",

It’s now October and I feel like I have no control over myself. I’ve read a bunch of Reddit stories and comments to rationalize my insatiable appetite now, but I’m truly worried my ED has developed into a binge eating disorder as I feel completely out of control when it comes to food. I live with my mom but I buy myself my own groceries, which used to sustain me very well between paychecks. Currently, though, it’s another story. I bought $250 worth of groceries when I got paid last week Friday but my supply has almost completely run out. I feel like the honest truth of it all is that the only reason I eat it all so fast is so I spend a longer amount of time without food I’m comfortable eating. I know this is only feeding my disorder, but has my anorexia turned into something else? \n\nI don’t currently have access to therapy and/or health insurance, so going to the doctor or nutritionist is a no-go. And I know Reddit isn’t usually the best place for things like this but I’m just looking for answers or advice at this point. Any help is greatly appreciated. ",

I’ve done everything I can do get rid of it. I keep myself really busy with healthy habits as much as much as I can so I don’t have to think about it. But nothing seems to work.

He’s expressed to us that he is not purging anymore. \n\nWe are in our late 20s and go out to bars and clubs a lot during the weekend. My friend has his own bathroom, but I’ve come in and seen puke specks on the wall next to the toilet. I’m not a squeamish person and I love him (lol) so I cleaned it up and didn’t mention it because I just assumed it was from him being sick & drunk or one of our other friends. \n\nWell, I found more puke today on a Monday morning and I know for a fact he didn’t drink last night. I brought it up to my partner and she had also cleaned up puke on a separate occasion as well, assuming the same thing as me.\n\nWe are really worried because in his early 20s he had a heart attack as a complication from his eating disorder. He’s also been very obsessed with his body image and talking badly about his physical appearance lately. I’m not sure how often he’s been relapsing and my partner and I aren’t experienced on this at all. We don’t want to hurt him further by bringing this up or trigger him accidentally. \n\nI think my plan is to let him know that we’ve noticed that he’s been purging and that we want him to go back to therapy. And ask him if there’s anything we’re doing that’s triggering him. I don’t know. Any advice or insight would be great. Thank you so much. ",

She says that i have an eating disorder, but I'm not sure if she really thinks that or if she's exaggerating. \n\nI guess it's worth mentioning that i do worry about my body shape and figure.

From the end of last year I was forced into recovery after being hospitalized after an OD due to my ed. I am extremely insecure to an Insurmountable extent, even more so now that I have gained 8 kilos due to recovery. I recently moved to a new school (this year) and my struggle with anorexia is a complete secret, from my friends, teachers and every staff member at the school. No one knows about it considering it’s not something I’m very proud of. This year has been a rollercoaster with my eating that only worsened after my new friends at school thought it was okay to make jokes at my expense about my weight. I replied to one of my friends unsolicited insults with “I’m going to be the bigger person” to which she responded “you’re always the biggest person in the room anyways, but don’t worry, animals can’t have eating disorders.” This chipped away at my want for recovery. My sister commented on my ankles saying that I have “cankles” so I went to school and asked my friend if it was true. This spiraled into my whole class turning me into a joke, calling me cankles and other names associated with cankles and calling out to everyone that the reason for cankles is fat. My ankles are one of my biggest insecurities as of now and my friends and classmates still make fun of me. Sure my ankles are wider than most, but I don’t have CANKLES. Now I truly believe I do. I have since gone back to my old ways, restricting, purging, and obsessing over every piece of food I consume, completely overwhelmed as I fall back to the worst head space I’ve ever been in causing me to think about sh and even death. My older sister and classmates don’t seem to have any intention of stopping the torment and I refuse to show any indication of the effects it has on me other than asking them to stop over and OVER. They think it’s a joke and I don’t know what to do. It’s driving me crazy. All I think about is food, how disgusting I am, my flaws, weight, and my CANKLES. I can’t take it anymore. I feel like I’m on the brink of breaking down in class in front of everyone and losing my shit which I don’t want. Any advice? Am I just being sensitive?",

I told my doctor I had lost a significant amount of weight without meaning too, and all he said was, \"I wanna see you gain weight.\" By the end of 2022, I was tasting metal in my mouth, and I was scratching my skin so much from intense itching that I sometimes bled.\n\nI went back to the doctor in 2023, complaining of waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing.

A NP then gave me Trazadone with the Zoloft, as my doctor was out of the office, and I ended up with severe Serotonin Syndrome, where I was awake for 9 days straight.

I think it's really messing with my ability to take care of my mental health which is already exhausting. I have cPTSD from the military, ADHD, Asperger's, and am always fighting with depression, anxiety, and a racing mind that doesn't shut up. \n\nI don't know anything about eating disorders or disordered eating - is there a difference?\n\nSome background -\n\n- When I was a kid, I wouldn't eat breakfast and I was too scared to eat at school in front of other people. My parents would have coffee and cigarettes in the morning, and I don't remember eating much breakfast unless it was like, a Sunday morning thing.\n\n- The last time I remember eating comfortably was when I was about 8 or 9. This is also when my parents started taking me to psychiatrists and therapists because I wasn't behaving appropriately in school. This started a crappy cycle of ritalin, adderall, zoloft, welbutrin, etc. I started seeing myself as someone very broken and damaged but never understood why. All of this was mostly at the instigation of my mother and my father's belt certainly added to things. Around this time, I also stopped trusting my parents with anything, and began to keep everything to myself. The few times someone would call my mom and tell them I wasn't eating, she would just tell them if I wasn't hungry, I shouldn't be forced to eat. I was really hungry, I was just too scared to speak up for myself\n\n- I remember getting home from school and being alone for a few hours before my parents got home. I was ravenous when I got home. I would eat everything I could find in those few hours - several packs of ramens, boxes of mac and cheese, a pack of bratwursts, it didn't matter. By the time my parents got home, they would be pissed because I had ruined my appetite for dinner, then I couldn't leave the table until I finished my plate of food. They never knew I wouldn't eat at school. I was hungry all day and when dinnertime came, I was already too full but still had to eat.\n\n- When I was 13ish, I started smoking, and started to learn that I can use cigarettes to not be hungry, and I still do that now. When I was around 14 or so, I started eating a lot of junk food and got pretty thicc as a teenager. Most of my teenage years were just surviving on junk food.\n\n- I joined the military when I was 19, and didn't know anything about what was supposed to go in my body. I failed my first few physical fitness tests in basic training and when I passed my first one, I decided to have a piece of cake. One of the drill sergeants saw me get a piece of cake and made me march around the dining facility yelling things about being a cow while everyone else ate their dinners. For the rest of the time in the military, I avoided the dining facilities and would just eat fast food or MRE's in my room. Later in the military, I had this basic mindset of food=energy, so right before some grueling physical endeavour, I would eat a calzone and coke because I thought it would make me perform better.\n\n- In my late '20s, depressed and in a bad way mentally after the military, I started to get into the old habits of not eating and just living with the hunger, then eating everything. \n\n- The only times I ever feel like I have my diet under control are when I have some goal to work towards\n\n-- I needed knee surgery when I was 30, and the doc said the lighter I was, the faster I would recover. I took a strong interest in keto, which led me to start learning about nutrition, but I took this WAY OVERBOARD. At least for once, I felt like I had control over what was going in my body though because I was working towards a goal.\n\n-- I lived in a temple and Thailand for a long time, and ate only meal a day and even then, it was just few small handfuls of food. I was nothing but skin and bones but again, I was in control because I felt that the reason for doing this transcended my comfort.\n\n-- I got into running and again, started fine tuning what was going into my body, to such an extent that I was just stressed out all the time about making sure I was fueling correctly and recovering quickly and again, I took it TOO FAR. I was in control because I was working towards something. \n\n-- Last year, I had a really messed up flatmate - I won't go into the details of this but she constantly badgered me about having disordered eating (she never said eating disorder) but it was in sort of a messed up way. She would try to cook me meals and say that she was trying to \"heal me\" with these meals and I would tell her I was uncomfortable eating in front of her, which would trigger her to start screaming and yelling about how I was disrespecting her for not eating what she prepared me. I just got small and stayed in my room and would only eat when she wasn't home.\n\nAny way, that last experience did get me thinking a lot, and I do have a really unhealthy relationship with food and I never realized how unhealthy it was until this year, AND THAT REALLY FREAKS ME OUT. I don't know where to start about it. I want to love food, but it just feels like a nuisance. I want to enjoy making food for myself, but I don't feel worthy of the effort. I want to say something tastes good or have some kind of refined palette to lean on but I don't understand how to cultivate that. I started talking to the therapist about some of the childhood stuff but it's just another thing to add to the long list of things to work with him on.\n\nDon't get me wrong, maybe once a month or every three weeks, I cook myself a nice meal but it's never about the meal, it's just to use some new kitchen toy or try something I saw on the internet. \n\nI'd like to imagine there is some version of me that can just healthily snack through life in a relaxed way while enjoying cooking myself simple yet nourishing meals, and enjoying the process of it, but I don't know him yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR - I think I have a lot of issues from childhood related to food and Life in general that I've brought forward into adulthood and I'm not sure where to start in developing a healthy, mature relationship with what goes in my body.\n\n",

(I'm also physically at a mostly stable weight). I love being able to eat my favourite foods again, and not stressing about not exercising anymore (I recently realised I sometimes had to motivate myself to go exercise, whereas before I used to have to actively stop myself from exercising all day every day). Here's the thing though; I somehow (and sadly, I know a lot of people deal with this thought) miss my eating disorder. And I'm not talking about \"oh, I don't fit in my jeans, should I lose weight?\". I'm talking about crying myself to sleep because of how much I miss being in control and because of how much I've convinced myself that it was better when I was restricting.\n\nPeople always talk about full recovery, and say it's worth it, and I agree for the most part. But part of me does wonder if the intense nostalgia just... stays forever? Is it just a matter of ignoring it, accepting that it's there, and moving on? \n\nPls don't tell me to 'remind myself how much recovery has brought to me!' because that doesn't work in those moments. I'm aware of everything I can do in recovery, I know I have to be grateful to have a functional and stable body, and yet, I miss the times when I didn't have all of that.",

Does anyone know of treatment programs that practice intuitive eating or really focus on cuing into the body? I know that’s a difficult topic because hunger/fullness cues are pretty messed up while having an ED, but I also don’t think that following a strict meal plan is totally the answer either. I don’t want to go to treatment, tick off the boxes and please the right people, and then be “good enough” for awhile which is what I feel like I’ve done in the past. I don’t know if any of this is making sense. \nMy ideal situation (which I don’t think really exists) would be to go to residential for a couple weeks to do a solid reset and then do an IOP that I can do while working part-time. I think I need help with symptom interruption and getting back on track, but I don’t think completely shutting out the world and not being able to practice living life is helpful for me either, which is why I was wondering if there was an option for short-term residential. \nI know I sound like a person who has an idealized mindset about treatment but I’ve done it all in the past (IP, res, PHP, IOP, OP) and I feel like I have a good idea of what I need.",

When it's bad like this it's literally all that can be talked about and there is usually absolutely nothing I can do to redirect them.

If something makes the ED brain scared that means it is probably a good thing. The ED brain's goal is for me to die. Therefore anything that it doesn't like is probably a good thing.  However holy crap is that uncomfortable. Every time I violate what it wants it gets angry.

So, I thought I’d suggest some books that may help understand some of these diseases. \nAnorexics on Anorexia\nBulimics on Bulimia\nBoth of these texts are valuable for the sufferer and their loved ones. First hand accounts surrounding various issues regarding the particular eating disorder mentioned. Short chapters for each account so if extended reading is a problem you can just read on account at a time. Written by the sufferers themselves, it is an inside look into the minds of the eating disordered patients. Good for self education and good for those suffering for some empathetic words. \nWasted by Marya Hornbacher has been a long standing book commonly read by eating disordered individuals. Again can be helpful for those trying to understand eating disorders as well. She does mention weights and calories and some tricks so I would not recommend people who have not been through recovery or who are newly diagnosed to read this text quite yet. She also has a memoir called Madness which is a more focused book on her severe bipolar disorder. Also very insightful. Also a book for alcohol anonymous entitled Waiting: A Non-believers Higjer power. A great book if you are a person who cannot relate to surrendering to a specific God. My ma has almost 29 years sober, is active in AA for that long and she even got something’s out of it. She. Has also recommended it to others and I let her Elena people my copy all the time. \n\nBack to eating disorders, loved ones can also check out books explicitly written for loved ones of a person with an eating disorder. \nAnd there are many websites catering to this population as well. A few are:\n\nFamilies Empowered and Supporting Treatment of Eating Disorders \nwww.feast-ed.org\n\nAround the Dinner Table (forum)\nwww.aroundthedinnertable.org\n\nAlso more general websites that can offer further information:\n\nwww.anad.org\n\nwww.nationaleatingdisorders.org\n\nwww.eatingdisorderhope.com\n\nwww.aedweb.org\n\nThere are many more that you can simply do a google search for and these links offer more as well and are very informative. \n\nI could go on and on but this is a good place to start. \nHope this helps some people!",

I need advice/tips what I can do to help her as her boyfriend.\n\n\nHello kind strangers,\n\nthis is my first post here but I really need help and could use some advice.\n\nMy girlfriend is an anorexic. She was always restrictive with food, moralized it and had very unhealthy \"weight goals\" and things like that even before we met 5 years ago. But over the last 1,5 years it got worse and worse, she got diagnosed with severe anorexia and is now at a point where she is incredibly emaciated, is dizzy all the time and often too weak to do even the things that bring her joy.\n\nShe suffers from dysmorphia, and because of that never sees herself as emaciated, eventhough to everyone around her it's clearly visible. She's terrified to be fat and body checks all the time, which traps her in toxic cycles that never give her anything but fear and desperation. Her tummy is her biggest trigger, she's always scared it's protruding since that's what she often sees, but in reality it's actually dented inwards not out.\n\nI think the main reason behind it is that she desperately wants to be seen as weak as she really is, because her whole life she was treated like she's strong enough to be able to take things. She has a unique mix of traits that make it impossible for her to live like an average person, she needs someone to care for her and support her with the world. For example, she was never able to handle school but was still forced to endure it until those responsible for her finally gave in and accepted she won't be able to graduate. She went through lots of traumatic experiences related to that but although she survived, barely, she never had a chance in the first place. \n\nI'm now at a point where I'm desperate to somehow help her but have no idea how to. In the past I tried to get her to eat on every chance I found because I'm so scared about her life, but that just put her under a lot of pressure and stress and led to horrible fights. I stopped doing that very recently as I finally realized it leads to nothing good, actually causing more damage and I don't want to break her further, but I'm really lost as to what I can do now. I try to support her by telling her that she's actually incredibly thin and emaciated and not whatever her dysmorphic brain shows her, and also trying to communicate that I'm worried about her because she doesn't eat enough to live, but without the former pressure behind it to immediately eat something. But I feel like I barely make an impact against her toxic, sick brain and it also doesn't help that her brain is always around but I can't reassure her 24/7.\n\nI could really use some advice, we are moving in together in a couple of weeks and she also said she wants to be able to move and not be too sick for that. So if anyone has advice I'd love to hear it. Thanks in advance.\n\n\n",

I got told i was literally going to die but i still don’t think i’m sick enough, how far will i drive myself to death to actually notice what i’m doing isn’t normal? then i thought about the deep physiological reason i am restricting, my bestfriend i considered my brother. everyday he did hurtful stuff to me and it got worse. the main thing he did that hurt me the most was slap my stomach and call me fat. i didn’t think of it that much, then i dropped him, spiralled into a pit of depression and overall crap. This is when i started body checking, eating the same but still conscious of my body. progressively i started restricting, always thinking i’m big, always striving to lose weight just to prove him wrong and not look like the old me. i’ve been in hospital from my vision going and being in bed rest for a week because i had one bite of skinny crunch every day for a week because of the guilt of eating a pizza. \n\nI’ve realised he is overall why i am the way i act now, he took control of my emotions, my freedom and now he’s taken control of my brain towards my body and food. i don’t want him to have that power. why am i putting myself through hell because he turned out to be a piece of shit? why have i let him take over my body? i loved my body i loved eating. i just hate it now, all i see is fat no matter how much weight i lose and not realise because fat is all i’ll think of. i’m never going to be satisfied with how i look yet i’ll still stick to my restrictive ways. \n\nDebating recovery: i want to actually enjoy food, i want to be happy, i don’t want to constantly think of bloating and how i look to please myself and other people. but at the same time i don’t want to look like the old me. i prefer how i look now to how i used to look which is scary because me now is unrealistic. do i really have to be an unrealistic body and person to like how i am and still deeply not like it?

        "Text": "I would like to disclose that I never had an ED myself, therefore if any part of my post comes off as tone deaf in any way, I sincerely apologize in advance. I have sympathy for every single one of you struggling and although I have my own mental health issues myself, I lack the real insight on this one. I hope I'm gonna be able to explain the situation well, and I'd need some perspective from you and I want to learn.\n\nI tried to cut it shorter but I want you to understand the context, so, here you are, and thank you very much for any comment in advance.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nProbably because I was busy with my own mental health all the time, I had a few very close friends with ED in my life. I think because I was self-centered enough to miss the signs and I never judged or maybe didn't even really notice their patterns.\n\nI met my BFF of 20 years at the university where none of us had very healthy life styles, we went to parties and ate instant ramen the next day. We often struggled with money, too, so I wasn't too concerned about her eating, we ate what we could. She looked healthy and very pretty. I noticed that she had a slight fatphobia, but I didn't notice anything unhealthy (I had girlfriends with anorexia before so I think I would have noticed it).\n\nA couple of years ago she started running and caring more about food, which was alright, I respected her for being a responsible adult.\n\nSoon she moved to another country, had a traumatic experience with her current boyfriend and slowly I realized all she was talking about was food and exercise. I remember found it a little triggering. I thought I was jealous that she put her sh\\*t together while I still haven't learned to take care of myself properly.\n\nHowever, I started to notice that she is anxious when the weather is too rainy for a good run, or that she went to the swimming pool when she was sick because she didn't want to miss a day. She started every single conversation with her sport achievements, while slowly creating a distance between us. We used to have so many things to talk about, but she started to redirect our conversations to sports and routine and sometimes she was a little condescending. She made it her whole personality. \n\nI also thought that maybe she didn't want us to trauma dump on each other like we did before and I understood it, I gave her some space and I celebrated her newly found stability that was rooted in sports.\n\n(We both have CPTSD so I know how crucial routines are.)\n\nI was struggling with my weight that time and I didn't feel very good about myself and I shared my training journey with her - I sent her pictures when I saw results, although I had a long way to go.\n\nShe was, of course, lean and sporty from all that sports, but I didn't care - we were on different journeys and I trusted her.\n\nOne day she sent me a picture about her \"new dress\" - from at least 6 angles, with hands up, from behind, and added: \"I need to lose some of that ass, though\".\n\nI felt so embarrassed, I thought we are over this kind of comments - she always felt like a safe space to me.\n\nI asked if she thought it was necessary to say something like that while obviously she is really pretty (she was skinnier than ever on the pictures), or she really thinks that about her own body? \n\nShe didn't take it very seriously, she redirected the conversation as if it was nothing (which we never did before, we always talk about things).\n\nA couple of weeks later I sent her a picture about my hair because I was not sure what to do with it and she replied like \"Are you wearing a crop top? It's so interesting...I would never....\" I was confused, again, and said that I think she is beautiful and she can wear a crop top or anything she wants but I didn't understand why she would say that.\n\nI think this is when I started to notice that many things changed and not necessarily between us but maybe with her. She might have thought that I \"figured her out\" so she started to mask. (This is only my own theory.) Every single conversation started with what she ate: she talks passionately about croissants, chocolate, treats that I have never seen her eating, not once. She came home from abroad, we met at a café, she didn't order anything because she was full, she disclosed it right at the first moment, she seemed so anxious about it. On the way to my train she explained how many pastries she ate last night and I felt she was not honest.\n\nSometimes she sends pictures of her food (3 leaves, 2 tomatoes and a little cheese after running 15-20 kilometers) so I think she is probably not eating pastry all the time or if she does, it's strange that she never does that with me.\n\nLast year she had a ligament injury. Before her operation she was overly anxious that she won't be able to run during her recovery, so she ran miles every day to \"build muscle\" in advance (with an injured knee). She injured her other leg, too, so she switched to cycling and she had an accident, so basically she did anything but listening to her injured body (in my opinion).\n\nDuring her recovery she opened our conversations every day with her walking-achievments, it seemed like she never stopped for a second and she kept repeating over and over again that she doesn't want to let go of sports (here, she added the list of sports every single time), and sometimes she said the exact same thing 3-4 times in 5 minutes without even noticing it.\n\nNow, basically every single time we speak, she starts with what she achieved, what are the sport plans for the upcoming days, what kind of things she ate because how much she loves eating.\n\nI never had the audacity to give her any feedback about her relationship with food but I told her once that I don't feel I know about her anything outside of her fitness journey and while I want to be the person who she feels comfortable to share her routines with, I don't feel that we touch topics that bring us closer.\n\nShe told me she understood and she never stopped, however. It seems like she can't.\n\nI feel like she is not honest with me. She changed so much, but I don't want to scare her so (I think) I am really considerate. Also, I don't want her to get more defensive and mask even more. \n\nI am not sure she has an eating disorder and I am not sure if she is aware of it if she does, and I am not sure what to do as her friend. \n\nI am concerned about her but I don't feel I am helping with this enabling that creates resentment in me over time. \n\nI kind of feel that she has found stability in her routines that prevent her to think about her boyfriend and her previous trauma, and I am almost sure that she is not ready to talk about it with me. \n\nDo you somewhat relate to her? Did you go through something similar? What would have been helpful to you? Is there something I misunderstand?\n\nI feel like I am losing her and I am confused because I need my own boundaries but I don't want to abandon her while she might need my help. I think I lack the insight and the words and I don't want to create more distance. If you have been her, what kind of approach would have helped you?\n\nThank you so much for all your feedback.",

        "Text": "For context this is a very close friend (10 years) and we're both mid-late 30s. She has been open with me about her history with an ED and still struggles, but also has been making an effort to gain weight in the last few months. She occasionally sublets my apartment, and the last two times I've come home to find the bathroom sink not draining properly. Both times I've cleaned it out and found some semi-solid gunk in there. I can't really imagine anything else that she'd be pouring down the bathroom sink that would have that consistency.  I've lived here over 5 years and have never had to clean that drain except the two times she's stayed. I quite strongly suspect she's been purging and I'm unsure of whether I should bring this up with her and check in about how her recovery is going/offer support. She's never mentioned purging as part of her ED in the past, only restriction, but I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't mention it because of embarrassment. She tends to give things in half-truths and sort of progressively reveal the whole story in bits and pieces with these types of things, which I don't try to push, I just let it come out in her time. I'm not interested in confronting her or shaming her and I don't care about my pipes or anything, just genuinely think that I may have a responsibility to try to offer support if I suspect this as she's a very close friend. I don't think she would react badly if I asked her and it *wasn't* true, but I would like advice on how to ask her in the best way possible in case it *is* true, and then what kind of support I should offer her in that case. \n\nAlso if it's more appropriate to just ask her in general if she wants to talk about about her recovery, I'd appreciate advice on how to frame that. \n\nFor some added context, years ago I had a flatmate who I suspected was purging and I never said anything because I felt awkward and didn't want to invade her privacy. Things escalated and I found out later she was hospitalised. It made me regret not bringing it up and offering her support at the time. \n\nAny advice is very much appreciated!",

        "Text": "I have just met someone who I will be seeing most days who told me they have an eating disorder (they haven't speicified which one, but they did say they struggle to eat so that rules out binge eating probably). I do not want to pry or go into things with them or try and 'save them' but I also want to make sure I am sensitive and more helpful than not helpful.\n\nAfter searching on here, reading a lot and reading basic \"how to support those with eating disorder\" articles...they are all coming from a place of helping a friend or loved one. I am not sure if I count as either of those things yet (but it may happen, I will be seeing them almost every day and friendships tend to spark from this kind of thing) and I don't think (or expect, or feel entitled to) them giving me all the gory details. But I do want to make sure that they feel safe around me and I don't do anything dumb. If anything, I want them to feel safe, not judged, and if they do want help, they could view me as an option if they wanted.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I have some understanding of how a request like this can come off so sorry if I am being offensive. I don't think this person is brittle, nor do I want to make this all about my own anxiety or whatever, but I would like to be more of a positive in their life than a total bummer or do something triggering...without interogating them on their needs and potentially making them uncomfortable.",

I had normal lunch and for dinner I had hummus with veggies and bread. Normal dinner. \n\nSo it did upset me, I was like - what kind of comment is that? This did not happen the first time, I feel like he often comments on my portion or is looking at my plate.\n\nSo we talked about it and from his point of view he did not mean it in controlling way, in his view is conversation like any other.

        "Text": "For context, i have a small family, and consider my cousin my sister, so going to refer to her like that. \nShe is older than me by six years, but we spend a fair amount of time growing up together. Her mom and our grandma, bullied her relentlessly , called her fat, ugly, lazy and abused her in many ways. \nMy mom on other hand, always gave comments about my body, about how at my age she weighed so little compared to me, etc. \nAnd my sister, always weighted more than me. \nSo we both developed a lot of insecurities, and now being independent adults those insecurities start to influence us in many ways. \n\nI struggle with mental health for a long time, take medication, try therapy and other. Eventually i developed some disordered habits, that evolved into full on restrictive ed. I became underweight, eventually, which left me feeling like i proved everything to everyone. \nBut at the same time, my sis started losing weight too. She is happy with how what she lost, and that everyone compliments her on being so skinny. \nI still weigh less than her, but the distance is very short. She is close to becoming underweight too. And it makes me feel so unvalid, so jealous, that i feel that i need to stop her from losing weight and ofc lose more myself. \n\nI genuinely think she might have some disordered behaviour, but i cant really know, we live far apart. So i started being almost like a therapist to her, being extra understanding, nice, patient, explain everything, i feel like i almost manipulate her into believing she doesn't need ro lose more for her own benefit and all the positives about maintaining or gaining. Explaining body neutrality, and having a lot of conversations about root of insecurities.\n\nAnd i know that it could help her honestly,  but i know that my motive is fucked up. I know that the only reason i care so much , is that cant stand a thought that we will weigh the same, or god forbid she weigh less than me .\nIm terrified of gaining now more than ever, and i always try catch any clues about how she looks, to compare and to know what she does. \nI subtly bodycheck in some things i send so she can see than im small, and give hints about how much i do sports and stuff. I feel fucked in the head. How could i do something like that to closest thing i have to a sibling? \nBut yeah, i even had a breakdown when she got to her first lw and it was my weight a few months ago.  My mom mentioning how we both lost much weight recently killed me, bc she and her sister were main causes of our complete resentment to how we look and how much we weigh. \nI dont know honestly how to act from here, bc im not ready to recover, and honestly, almost nobody knows that i have an ed bc i live very far. \n\nTl;dr\nI try to prevent my sister from developing ed and convince her to gain so i can be the skinnier one \n",

Since last January been restricting a lot until March/April when I met the angel who’s now my boyfriend and started eating more and more balanced. I have been having a sweet treat here and there and he cooks for me healthy meals. I have not had any bingeing episodes (which I am very happy and proud of!) since. I have obviously increased my daily calories intake since April. I had gained a couple kilos but in the past couple weeks seems like I have gained another couple which when I weighed myself made me want to cry. I don’t particularly like my body now even though it’s at a healthy weight but I can work on it. I am just really scared at the fact I cannot explain why I keep gaining and afraid my weight will keep increasing despite eating normal amounts. Why do I feel like once i have “trusted” my body now it is betraying me? A few kg are noticeable and also scared about what my colleagues and my bf will think about me.\nAnyone has had similar experiences and can empathize? I feel like I’m going crazy and I feel like I want to restrict because “if I keep eating normally then it is clear I’ll keep gaining and never stop”, that is what my head is telling me. \n\nI had to tell this to someone as I feel like none around me understands. I talked with my bf and he said he’s “happy I’ve gained weight” which I am not sure what he means but did not help. He is very understanding and never comments on my appearance as he does not want to give me validation solely on how I appear, but I feel like lately I’ve been asking him “do I look like I’ve gained some weigh?” more than usual and also scared he’ll get fed up of this but I cannot help it. \n\nI’d appreciate if you wanted to share your experiences or any words of advice.

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "In August of 2023, I, 16F, started restricting calories (not an extreme restriction) and developed OSFED. I went from a higher end of normal BMI to a medium normal BMI. I started purging behaviors (not very consistently) around November of 2023, and started “recovery” and worked with a nutritionist in January 2024. I developed BED in recovery and have been stuck in a very bad cycle of binging and unsuccessfully restricting. I stopped seeing my nutritionist in May and haven’t consistently been to therapy due to time issues. All this has led me to believe at my highest weight ever- higher than I started at. \nIt doesn’t help that I’m constantly bloated, either. All my BMs are either small and pebbly or thin and inconsistent. I’m bloated every time I eat, every time I wake up, I’m consistently bloated (which is extremely triggering.) \nMy eating habits are also irregular. I’ll eat “normally” a couple days, then get triggered into either binging or restriction, which then leads to the other one, and then stay in that cycle for like 3 weeks. This happens over and over again. In general, I normally eat a lot at night, sometimes I will eat a very small amount of calories during the day (because I don’t feel hungry or am purposely restricting) and then I’ll eat my TDEE (and sometimes more) at nine pm or so. \nI recently saw my therapist and she said eating regular meals will help my gut regulate. I’m extremely scared of this because I’m scared I’ll gain even more weight and i can’t shake the notion that it won’t work and I’ll just “gain for nothing.” This fear is made greater because I’m very visually weight restored and still have these GI issues. I can’t deal with not fitting on all the old clothes I used to have anymore. I want to not be limited to baggy sweatshirts solely because my gut is sticking out so much just because I ate a normal meal. I can’t deal with feeling the weight on my body every time I wear clothes and I’m just constantly distressed about this- I can’t focus on anything else but binging or restricting or my weight.\n\nDoes anyone else have stories like this? I just want hope that my gut will heal and everything will be fine.\n\nAnother question- please excuse how vain and stupid this probably sounds- but is there a way that I could lose weight in the future? I’m scared that even after I heal my GI tract from actual committed recovery, the moment I try to do a healthy, gradual deficit, it will set off the alarms and ruin my GI tract again. Will my intensities and digestive systems be overly sensitive now? I just don’t want to stuck like this forever  and at least get back to my pre-ed weight (especially for prom lol)\n\nAny response and insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n",

you believe i really have bulimia then? what kind of bulimic am i when im not even skinny yet?\" and laughed. i told her, its not about weight, you can be literally obese and have an eating disorder. i told her that please, let go visit a psychologist just once, and they will realise you have an eating disorder and youll believe them cause theyre an specialist. she just reminded me that shes a doctor herself and knows better, and i realised im not gonna be able to help her. i couldnt help but cry, but then in response she just said \"wow, finally you show some sympathy or emotion, i never thought you would care about me\" as i have autism and usually seem emotionless until its too much and i end up crying. this just made me cry even more and i just went to my room to cry, and she told me that instead of worrying about her having an eating disorder, i should worry about how fat i am. it is important to mention i have always weight more than her.. and i mean like, anywhere from 10-30 kg more than her during different stages of my life. this is obviously not great as i am younger than her but that doesnt mean i should try to have an eating disorder. hearing her tell me that just crushed me. i had no idea what to tell her. i just cried more. this made me realise i just cant fix her, and i dont know if ill ever be able to. i cant see her do all this. i cant see her torture herself everyday. i cant see her \"recruit\" other poor people to join her \"dieting\" lifestyle and group promising them fast weightloss. i cant take how much she berates me, herself, or any stranger or \"friend\" she deems \"too fat\". i dont even know why im posting this. i need to vent but i guess i also want advice but i dont even know if theres any advice thats gonna help me help her.",

I see her about every month for a family visit and her weight has plummeted. Her eating is incredibly restrictive to some protein and that's about it. She refuses to eat food I offer and brings her own.\n\nI've talked to her dad (my brother) whose aware that his daughter is developing a disorder. He has been talking with her and is considering therapy. Her mother is not concerned, and admitted she just thought she was a picky eater. \n\nI'm worried because, not only is she thin, but during our last visit she appeared pale and gaunt, complained of being dizzy, and has a repeated knee injury from exercising too much that her doctor has warned her will get worse if she keeps exercising. I'm not sure if her doctor has picked up on the change.\n\nWhat are ways I can support her? I'm close to her and my brother and suffered from body image issues as a teen. Thanks in advance!",

        "Text": "I am a 23-year-old f who’s been addicted to hot Cheetos for 19 years. My older cousins first introduced them to me when I was 4 years old. \n\nI would see them have this black canister with the words “asteroids” and was instantly tempered to see how spicy they were. ever since then, I was intrigued by the spicy flavor. During my elementary years, I wouldn’t go a single week without them, and remember how I would always ask my parents for a dollar. During the time, my parents were constantly fighting so I would distract myself by craving hot Cheetos. \n\nWhen I was 12 my parents eventually got divorced I ended up spending my summer in a small room with my dad. I would always ask to go to the park, the 99cent store, or any gasoline store to stock up, and when I did, that specific summer I started increasing my bag intake from 2 reg bags a week to 4 regs a week, 2 bags a day, to 3 bags a day.\nSurprisingly I wasn’t overweight at the time but it eventually creeped up to me. \n\nAt the age of 15, I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2. I remember telling myself I would stop and I wouldn’t do it anymore and my parents stopped giving me money for them. But I eventually started asking classmates for money and they would give me money to buy chips after school. I would take my medication that was prescribed at the time and still eat chips daily but it decreased to 1 bag every 2 days. I would feel super guilty that I eventually felt the need to purge my food out and become bulimic. \n\nOnce I graduated high school In 2020 I started working at a subway and got into a toxic relationship at the time. During the time we were on lockdown due to Covid and remember stocking up on hot chips as much as possible and hiding them from my family. My bag intake increased drastically again. \n\nI started to have bulimic symptoms again and would purge once in a while the doctors started noticing that my A1c was at 5 so they thought I didn’t need to inject trulicity anymore. They removed me from my medication and 2 months later I ended up in the hospital for pancreatitis. I was told DO NOT EAT any more chips and I always swore I wouldn’t do it no more the pain was horrible and I couldn’t stand it.\n\n I went 2 months clean from eating junk. Then eventually I relapsed once I was asked if I wanted a chip from my little sibling. I don’t understand how a bag of extra hot Cheetos has such a hold on my life. My bulimic symptoms come and go but I don’t purge anymore due to stomach complications that I’ve caused myself. However, I still crave the taste to this day, and for my mouth to water. \n\n I’ve tried going to healthier alternatives, like Trader Joe’s spicy tortilla chips but I always seem to miss the original flavors. Every time I tell anyone about my struggle, people seem to laugh at me and say well just stop. I tell them I’m trying I am but when I’m pumping gas I feel like something is telling me to go inside just look around. I eventually bought a bag. The last time I ate a bag was yesterday Sept 24th and today I  kept reflecting on how I go to the gym I have yoga class. I take diabetes medication and have gone to the hospital to try to combat all of this, but yet I’m still addicted and want more.\n\n I also want to mention that I am in therapy and had spoken to a nutritionist before but not in a long term and it seemed that I would get a grasp of what they’re telling me but I would bounce back to them. What should I do?",

One month into our relationship i expressed how if she wasnt willing to get better we'd breakup due to how much it affects me and our relationship. So she started to tell me how she was recovering. Now for the past three weeks she says shes been eating at her maintenance and telling me how much better she is and stuff. I think shes faking it so i wont leave. She is still losing weight extremely fast, we cant get through any hangout without her falling asleep and getting irritable, her hair is still dead and falling out in clumps, her eyes are more sunken in than ever as well as every other side effect of anorexia. Every single day I ask her how shes doing and every day she promises me shes doing better and in recovery . I have seen no improvement with her nothings changed and it's so frustrating. I don't know is this normal? Is this just part of recovery? I love her so much and I want her to be happy and healthy more than anything. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice or comment would be greatly appreciated. ",

I drink something with fizz at least several times a day (and not TV static flavored seltzers lol). My friend refers to these urges as \"mouth pleasure.\" Its not a boredom thing. Its not an emotional reaction. its just that I LOVE the taste and feel of food.\n\nSometimes, I'm good at resisting this urge, but most of the time, I'm not. Is there a technique to stop this behavior? I mean besides just willpower? I've tried replacing \"bad\" food like candy with \"good\" food like berries and bananas... and I'm consistent with that when there are fruits I like around. I've also been good at eating higher-quality foods (more veggie dishes, leaners meats, better quality grains). BUT, the underlying problem is that I might consume until I run out of food. I've tried limiting the food I have in the house... but, then I just go to the store anyway because its a 2 minute walk from my front door :-/\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate: I am not stress-eating or boredom-eating. I'm kinda like a druggie, but if his drug of choice was mexican food and/or pasta :-/. Doing liters of coke, not lines of coke :-/. And, yeah, I can't just quit cold turkey (heh) like they do because I will NEED to eat at some point. Would it make sense to treat food like an addiction? And, if so, what techniques would make sense for someone in my situation?",

She’s very eloquent and seems to have an understanding that she does indeed have an eating disorder but she got upset when I labeled it as such. She only recognized it as “problems”.

He’s having intense flatulence all night long. Is it normal for it to ebb and flow like that? Is it possible it’s related to his dietician gradually bumping up his intake? If so, will it kind of reset every time they bump up his intake? ",

She has also appeared distant lately. D told me that during lunch, she had an empanada, and only ate the meat inside and picked the dough out.

Ive heard her crying and other people have to when visiting previously, I’ve subtly been keeping and eye on what she’s eating and how much, how often ect. I’m almost certain she feeds the dogs most of her food or will try to sneak it in the bin. When she does eat a lot i think she’s purging as she will quickly head to the bathroom afterwards. I don’t live in the same house as her now but I’ve been staying here for the past week due to my mum being in rehab, my mum is aware she is struggling but doesn’t do anything to help (idk if it’s because she doesn’t know how to). My sister doesn’t have contact with her dad and we lost our grandad in January and he was more or less her dad and she’s gotten worse since then, her  bio dad has a heart condition and she was getting tests to check it wasn’t hereditary(I don’t know the outcome of this) but I’m concerned it will cause her heart problems. I don’t comment on her body but I try to still compliment her in different ways like “I like your outfit” “your hair looks good” “you have lovely nails” ect because I don’t want to not compliment her and have her think she looks disgusting or anything but I also don’t want to feed into her disorder but I just want more tips on how to actually help her, I haven’t sat down and had a conversation with her about it because I don’t know what to say as I don’t want to trigger her but I want her to know she can always come to me with anything that’s bothering her, any tips would be greatly appreciated ",

I’m not anorexic or bulimic because I really do want to gain weight, and I’m aware that I’m too skinny and underweight.\n\nOne of the issues is that I really like the feeling of having an empty stomach. It makes me feel smarter when I’m programming at my computer or when I have to do something that requires focus, but even when I’m just sitting on the couch.\n\nOn the other hand, after I eat, especially if I eat a lot (and “a lot” has now become just a normal meal for most people), I can’t focus on anything for a few hours, and I feel physically sluggish.\n\nLately, I’ve tried to ignore these sensations of physical and mental heaviness, and I’m trying to eat as much as I can at every meal, but I still can’t manage.\n\nWhen it’s time to eat, and I might even be a bit hungry, I get full immediately after eating just a little. The only way I can eat a lot (potentially a really large amount) is by using some benzodiazepine, like Xanax or similar. After taking it, I can eat as much as I want, but I can’t stand the effect of these drugs. I don’t like feeling sleepy and spaced out.\n\nMy life is becoming hell.\n\nDo you have any advice on how I can increase my appetite? (Whether it’s medications or maybe mental techniques.)\n\nP.S.: Please don’t suggest seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist or anything like that, because if that were possible, I wouldn’t be writing this post. I’m already seeing both (a psychologist and a psychiatrist), but for personal reasons that I don’t want to explain, they can’t help me with this.",

I'm 27 now, and I've never been without this. \n\nBut.. I haven't binged in 2 months.

It's also happening with medication to a degree, but the food situation is *not good*. Today I ate 5 Ritz crackers and immediately had to throw them up, and that's been it. I was in the ER last week for a panic attack related to the medication fear, and because of what's happening with this, they said I was *very, very* dehydrated. I finally spoke to my therapist about it Wednesday (I do talk therapy/CBT + neurofeedback therapy, for reference) and I'm trying to follow her advice, but its not working. \n\nI've tried to logic my way through this. Distractions. Breathing, cathartic sighs, butterfly taps. I've tried to eat while regressed. *Nothing I'm doing is working*. I'm so tired of feeling so afraid. It's been a month now, but the past week has been the worst, and it only seems to be getting worse.. \n\nIf anyone has any advice.. it would be greatly appreciated 💜  Or even just to feel like I'm not alone in this kind of thing.

She was even impressed that I had got her to try new foods that she normally wouldn't have tried. \n\nMoving on into our relationship she co fided in me that people including her friends and ex boyfriend had called her fat. This broke my heart because she isn't remotely overweight. She was already slim and her being overweight did not even cross my mind. I told her they were wrong and that was it for about a month.\n\nThen she decided she wanted to diet. I told her while I didn't think she needed to lose weight, I would support her decision if it made her happy. Very quickly I noticed that she was restricting to a very unhealthy amount, but was drastically overestimating her consumed food. Eating one very small meal per day. \n\nThis worried me tremendously as she had recieved some very bad diet advice from people she knew. I suggested that she use a tracker to make sure she ate enough during the day. She took my advice and things were going pretty smoothly.\n\nNot long after though she began to become frustrated with her lack of progress. She began to workout for hours at a time and significantly redcuded how much she would eat. Also began skipping meals for the day if she believed she had ate to much the day prior.\n\nI learned that she does worse when people try to get her to eat more, so ad hard as it has been, I've tried to let her do her thing, as much as I want to encourage her to eat. Though it does slip sometimes and i encourage her to have something.\n\nShe has also been using 0c foods and drinks like coke zero and sugar free jello to fill her stomach. Lots of caffeine as well. She even did a ED test and showed most of the signs of an ED. This shocked her. But she laughed it off and said she doesn't have one. \n\nShe recently has seemed to settle down a bit as she is closing in on her goal weight, but still has an unhealthy relationship with food. I am worried that as she closes in on her goal, she isn't going to stop her diet. Since she used the excuse that it will be hard to eat as she has no time with work.\n\nShe has also recently started to accuse me of things that I am not. She told me today that I am a picky eater, which is very far from the truth. Also has told me that I go all day without eating sometimes, which is also not true.\nThat's an issue on its own as i don't know if she is projecting, or just hasn't paid attention to who I am as a person the last year. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I love her more than anything, but it has been incredibly stressful to see her go through this. I've suggested she talk to someone, but she instists that she is fine and not to worry.. She has never dieted as far as I know in her past, so I dodnt think she has had an issue with this before. \n\nI want to help, but I am not well versed in this subject and don't want to make things worse.

I have no idea how to bring it up. I can barely admit that I have an ED outloud. Please note: I did ask my therapist for some insight but maybe speaking with others in this situation would be beneficial to me too. I'm trying my best. \n\n1.) I'm so afraid of judgement from the GI doctor. \n2.) what if all the GI issues I have are because of my ED? There's a lot of shame and guilt there, and chances are the symptoms I am experiencing now are correlated (at least from what I've read). \n\nI didn't imagine this being so hard. I do want to be better. I am also scared. If anyone has gone through this process and has some helpful insight, or just wants to share their experience, I'd appreciate it. ",

I have major depressive disorder, anxiety, and autism and have been going through another rough patch and I’m thinking that my mind just latched onto controlling weight and food as a coping mechanism. Previously, while depressed I either eat a lot or have zero appetite whatsoever and just saw that as a little benefit so I wouldn’t gain weight.\n\nNow I am trying to exercise daily (that’s good, right?) and am very careful about what I eat and only eat one thing a day. Sometimes a meal, sometimes just a single piece of food. But now it’s getting to the point where I feel insanely guilty and anxious just over eating that one thing even if it’s supposed to be a healthy thing. Like, even a single kiwi fruit or a simple salad makes me feel nauseous with anxiety about eating even though I can tell that I’m hungry. I’ve purged meals out of guilt. The feeling of being full makes me sick to my stomach.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice with this and how to think about just eating little things like that in a healthier way? I just feel so stumped and alone—I’m too afraid to mention this to my mother and my partner doesn’t know what to do about it, and I can’t go to a doctor or therapist or anything because I don’t have health insurance.\n\nThank you.",

I tried something that was simple and a comfort but even that is making my stomach go in knots. \n\nI've been drinking lots of water to try and make up for it because for some reason liquids are okay. I need help in tricking myself into being hungry. My next idea is to try a milkshake that has the nutrients I need. \n\nSide story, my other doggo is actually going through the same thing but I get her to eat by putting a small amount of olive oil and a bit of shredded cheese in her dish. Hopefully that helps someone in the unfortunate event that they need to get their doggo to eat. ",

I grew up in a very financially and food-insecure home, of which I still live in, and unfortunately it's gotten progressively worse over the months for reasons I won't go over here.\n\nDue to having to change my diet drastically on top of already having not much food at home, I've begun to lose weight very fast.\n\nRecently I've found myself becoming scared to eat anything out of fear of regaining that weight and it's starting to take a toll on me. I'm so overly-fixated on my size, weight, and appearance now. It kind of hit me today while I was stressing over the thought of eating a simple boiled egg today that I'm beginning to adopt a mindset that's leading me to becoming anorexic.\n\nHaving this realization, I want to immediately stop it, but I'm struggling with how I want to do that. I essentially become paralyzed at the thought of eating now and I don't want to be like this, however my options are so limited. I feel kind of by myself with this struggle.\n\nI'd really like to hear from others who may have pushed through anything remotely similar. Are there some exercises I could practice to help the food anxiety?\n\nI'm grateful to have caught on before it got any worse, but I'm intimidated to reverse it.\n\nAny advice would help a lot.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

I know it's incredibly silly but I feel left out?\n\nPeople will mention how comments on theirselves affected others and how they made people insecure but (i) my ED has never really been so serious, I know people with EDs usually feel \"not sick enough\" but I genuinely feel like my experience was the definition of not sick enough: I never counted calories, I fainted like twice in the entirety of my ED and I couldn't do fasts etc and (ii) I didn't even lose any weight in the end for people to be insecure over not having my body.\n\nAnother thing is I feel like I have no opportunity to make others feel bad based on comments because my ED is almost cyclical? In summer I'll be in the trenches and I won't even be leaving the house or around anyone to be able to say anything concerning. To add on even when I'm around people I'm so mindful about what I say, I feel like I'm hyper aware of how those thing affect others because of how they affected me, I'm always the first to tell people they're beautiful and that their weight doesn't define them. Plus whenever school starts up again and I'm around people I start eating again because studying with that brain fog is diabolical work and I care a lot more about my grades than how I weigh. \n\nAnother thing is that I find people often have many goals to reach before they consider themselves skinny. I think it may have to do with a difference in regional beauty standards but I'm absolutely fine with being curvy, but here in (atleast East) Africa the ultimate beauty standard is curvy with a flat stomach and that is the only thing I've wanted so desperately. I've never understood why people would want a thigh gap or skinny arms or anything like that.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I was hoping for with this post. Maybe reassurance that I wasn't strange (past the ED thing) and that I'm valid and that probably is it but I also feel selfish making a whole post for that reason. but also am I describing something else?

During the pandemic, I found that content on fat liberation, body positivity, and body neutrality really helped me adjust my way of thinking about my body and improved my relationship with food.\n\n(TW--dieting and weight loss)\n\nMy boyfriend of 1 year (27M) I believe has some body image issues, in that he is critical of himself when he gains weight. He does keto for several months once a year to lose weight. He says that doing the keto diet makes him feel happier, healthier, more energized, and he saves money. He also says he is doing it to slim down to fit his clothes better. I want to be supportive that he is doing this for health reasons, but I still worry that he is stuck in those old trains of thought I used to have, that to be healthy is to be thin. He is also counting calories and macros, and tracking what he eats, which I find really worrying and also triggering.\n\nI feel that in order to go on my own healing journey, I had to embrace the idea that thin does not mean healthy, food is fuel and you should be listening to your body and what it needs rather than counting nutrients and calories. To support my boyfriend, I feel like I have to unlearn these things, as they are directly in conflict with his own opinions. But if I do unlearn them, I think I'm at risk of relapsing. I've already been seeing the signs. \n\nIt's like either I have to undo years of improvement and healing and believe in diet culture propaganda again, or else I have to constantly be critical of and worried for my boyfriend and his behaviour that I see as harmful. I tried just asking him not to talk about it around me, but I find myself being triggered, concerned, or judgemental every time he cooks or reads an ingredient label or mentions his carb intake.

It's been awhile since I've struggled with this but I am a bit fearful and unsure of how to go about losing weight in a healthy way this time. As I'm nearing 30 things are starting to get harder for me health wise and my family has a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. I'm uncomfortable physical in my weight and I want to be better. How do I go about losing weight after dealing with disordered eating. Is there a specialist I talk to? I've never shared these issues with anyone due to embarrassment so I don't know how to help myself without going overboard.",

Then about 3 months later he seemed to finally be content with just getting worse, and I am aware that is likely because he is just comfortable with me now and probably isn’t bothered to get better anymore but I just feel so upset that this is happening.\n\nAround this time I did once send him a long paragraph detailing how I wanted him to get better and I knew he wouldn’t get better for himself so I said (I know it wasn’t smart to ask but I felt desperate) to try to recover for me or his friends, or just anyone because I knew he wasn’t going to do that for himself; he obviously turned it down and told me this was his normal and he didn’t think he could ever get better, especially without support. \n\nNow he has gotten so bad that he can’t go outside without feeling faint and he has gotten himself sent to A&E due to passing out at school as he hadn’t eaten anything and had purged everything he had already, he had also went out with his friends and had to have one of them carry him to his bus stop because his heart beat was so intense and he was about to faint, he has also cancelled our dates many times due to this and today he cancelled our date as we missed our movie and decided to weigh himself to see if he deserved to go out or not (and the verdict was to not haha, it’s not funny but I’m laughing) — this is all in one week. \n\nHe has been trying to give me an ‘out’ a lot recently, telling me if this is too much and it’s making me miserable that we need to talk about our relationship and I don’t have to stay, I want to stay I never want to leave him and it makes this so hard. \n\nToday when he cancelled bc of his body issues he asked if I was angry and I answered honestly, I was tired of constantly having him cancel and me being left disappointed (I know that’s selfish but I don’t care I couldn’t help being upset and I think it’s fair that I was especially since I hate when plans are cancelled last minute and he hates it too lol) \nAnyways I’ve been crafting a damn letter to send him because at this point he is not just severely disordered he is dying, and I’m scared that he will not be able to function one of these days and he seems to not even care.\n\nI’m not meaning to sound bitter but I am just trying to get this out and be as honest as I could be so I could get some helpful advice which is;\nIf you struggle with an ed or your loved one has how did you deal with it? I know there’s realistically nothing I can say to ‘fix’ him but what can I do to help? \n\nAny sort of advice at all is appreciated\n\nThank you",

We had been following each other on Instagram during that time, prior to before we had a genuine conversation.\n\nMy gf has never met or seen my ex gf in real life, however she has seen pictures of my ex gf from my instagram page from when I used to be with my ex. I have taken down these pictures long ago but my gf had apparently screenshotted them. \n\nMy gf regularly looks at pictures of my ex gf and it feels almost obsessive. She started by randomly showing me a picture of me and my ex gf at a party that was taken ages ago when me and my ex were still together. And my gf started making comments saying that my ex was “pretty” and that she looks like “the dream girl”. I didn’t know how to respond and I sort of dismissed it and said that I only had eyes for her.\n\nEver since then my gf has shown me more pictures of my gf on many occasions and makes other comments. However the comments started to appear more and more often and they seem very self-depreciating. She started making direct comparisons like saying that I probably wished she had a bigger chest like my ex and I was shocked when she first said it. That had not even been a thought in my mind but when I tried to tell her different my gf just laughed and then said it wasn’t that serious.  She usually says things like “wouldn’t every guy want a girl like that?” and I have no idea how to answer because I don’t know and why does it matter what most guys would want. I only want my gf and I hate how she compares herself.\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say she makes these comments daily. She usually does it three times a day and shows me a picture of my ex every week. She compares herself with my ex in every criteria like nose size, hair length, eyebrows and even shoe size and it’s getting out of hand. I’ve caught her stalking my exs facebook profile and  looking at pictures of my ex in a swimsuit and when I confronted her about it she cried and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. I felt so bad for making her cry, i’m just not very good with words and I feel like i don’t say the right things to reassure my gf that I am attracted to her only. I feel responsible for everything that’s happened because I feel like If i hard given my gf an appropriate response the first time she had called my ex “the dream girl” none of this would have happened. \n\nMy gf struggles with various types of eating disorders and has significant body image issues, she has been diagnosed with multiple eating disorders for a long time and she goes through phases of going to therapy and receiving treatment for it. She is currently occasionally visiting a psychiatrist. Her constant comparisons are causing her to spiral deeper into a bad state.\n\nI love my gf and i think she’s very pretty and I truthfully would never have even thought of my ex at all if my gf didn’t bring her up everyday. \n",

Her parents don’t seem to be able to deal with the issue, and it’s a secret in plain sight. Lately she seems to be doing better, although it is impossible to tell since she wouldn’t share anything and we aren’t close enough - we met as grown ups, and I live abroad and only come back every few months. \n\nWe were on holidays together last week, and she was on a restrictive diet throughout, which I respect and would never comment on. However, she started making a lot of subtle comments about how much I was eating (“that’s a big portion”, “it’s a big plate” etc..) and looking at my plate with disdain. I felt judged all along, and it was very uncomfortable. I never had an issue with food, however when I was a teenager I tended to eat a bit more than others, and was slightly overweight- I have a healthy weight now, but I’m definitely not skinny. Her comments triggered something quite ugly in me, because I don’t have an issue with food and I would never say something about how much she eats or doesn’t eat. Another thing that really made me uncomfortable is how my step-father implied that I am “jealous” because she can be on a “diet” (this wasn’t in front of her, but when we discussed the issue after). I couldn’t believe that he is not recognizing that her relationship with food is complicated and she suffers/suffered from an ED, and how the issue was twisted against me and my “insecurities”. I am now dreading the thought of having to eat at the same table with them again. \n\nHow can I deal with this situation? I want to support my step-sister but I also don’t want this to affect my mental health. ",

I started noticing I have some weird behaviors around obsessing over scale weight, and was using excessive running/cardio to try and compensate. I seem to have gotten back to the activities I like (lifting) and stopped excessive cardio. I’ve been lifting for the last 10 years mainly just for the love of it, and realized I was only doing cardio to try and burn cals. I’m still struggling with the balance between clean eating/being afraid of gaining weight/gaining fat, obsessing over the scale but also wanting to gain more freedom with food/gain some more muscle and gain some strength. My thoughts are to try and start incorporating more “cheat” foods as kind of exposure, keeping cardio to a minimum ( so it doesn’t become excessive). The thing that’s tricky is not being afraid to gain weight, I’ve even told myself that I would allow myself to go on a cut if I gained a certain amount of weight and wasn’t happy with how I looked but I still struggle with seeing weight gain as a “negative” even if I know it isn't the case. I also don't know how much weight I should \"allow\" myself to gain (mainly for psychological reasons to help in committing to getting more food freedom). Maybe a better idea would be to commit to a number of days or something? Idk if y'all have any thoughts/advice to try and chunk it up into smaller exposures of recovery if you will.  \n  \nsorry for the long essay but any advice would be super appreciated.

        "Text": "Idk if anything I say might be triggering so here’s a blanket TW ab weight talk and restriction\n\n(Sorry in advance for the long post. TLDR at the end)\n\nI (22F) have been overweight my entire life and have always been insecure. About two years ago, a family friend saw me for the first time in a little while and said that it looked like I had lost weight. I hadn’t really lost much but I guess I maybe had lost fat and gained muscle. This quickly led to me restricting more and more to keep it off and run with that momentum of losing weight until it became a fear of gaining any weight. I never got formally diagnosed with anorexia but have struggled with disordered eating since then. After a year of this, I had lost a significant but still not insanely unhealthy amount of weight but I was obviously miserable. To make it all worse, I couldn’t seem to get lower than a certain weight but I was too scared to lower my calorie limit more than I already had bc I didn’t want to lose control bc I’ve always known ab the long-term effects of severe restriction. I finally gave in and started seeing a nutritionist to try and get over that plateau bc I had messed up my metabolism so much that any extra calories was noticeable on the scale the next day. With her help, I got my daily calorie limit up and introduced some fear foods back into my diet slowly and i stopped weighing myself and only using a tape measure. I kept track and ended up losing a bit more off my measurements even with a higher calorie goal and more “scary” foods. I have not been able to see her for around six months now and have slowly entered “recovery” but at the same time, ive never gone to psychological therapy for my disordered eating and now im weighing myself again and can feel myself slipping and feel the fears becoming louder than they have been in a while. \n\n\nWith the help of my fiancé (who I met around the time I started to get worse), I was able to keep myself from spiraling to the point of needing hospitalization or anything bc he would hide calorie information from me and when I ate scarier foods and didn’t blow up like a hippo, I felt a little less scared of those foods. Lately, I’ve gained weight some weight but not inches and I’m struggling with dealing with the numbers and ignoring the voices in my head telling me it was easier when I was still restricting more than the calorie deficit I am still in. I’m still maintaining the calorie deficit i established with my nutritionist but idk what’s going wrong. I work as a CNA in a nursing home which is a very physically demanding job so I do burn a decent amount of calories doing that but idk what is going on.  \n\nTLDR: I’m struggling to not go back to my old habits after gaining a bit of weight. Any advice on how to fight those voices and not fall back into my old behaviors? I’m worried that if I start restricting again I will lose control and go back to my disordered habits. ",

        "Text": "Hi all, \n\nMy S/O has a BED. In recent memory she got sessions for CBT with a focus on BED. Granted, she learned a lot here (particularly helpful was the idea of regular eating for example). However there's one thing that I found quite conflicting with her advice, and genuinely believe it's just added confusion to her recovery. \n\nI'm currently reading a book called \"Ultra Processed People\", which discusses how western society is obsessed with, without realising, UPF (ultra processed foods). A quick outline states how we are putting chemicals in our body which cause a lot of issues - weight gain, altered brain chemistry, tooth decay etc etc. \n\nOne of the topics I found insightful was the addictive elements of these foods - how they don't make us feel full, and how it makes us want to eat more (a lot of this is to do with the sweeteners found in these substances - quick example here is 'diet' drinks). \n\nDuring my S/O's therapy, she has always been told that there's no such thing as \"bad food\". And, I understand to an extent, that if you suffer with a BED, the act of restricting yourself from certain foods can ofc lead to binges. \n\nBut does this not seem counter effective in regards to recovery? If you eat foods that are naturally more addictive, to which you don't feel satisfied from, surely that's detrimental? Particularly to those who are more vulnerable. \n\nAs a side note, the author outlines it as a systemic issue, that these food companies do indeed pray on vulnerable people (those with an unhealthy relationship to food, and of course those who live in poverty as these foods are way cheaper than raw ingredients in most instances). \n\nHas anyone had any similar thoughts, or, has anyone here potentially stayed away from these foods, and found any benefit to doing so whilst suffering with a BED? \n\nI'm all for being educated here, so apologies if this post comes across as potentially ignorant. But I just want to know as much as possible so that I can be there to help my S/O. \n\nThanks all",

I said, \"I'm bad at tap.\" She asked why I replied I needed more practice.

He is very supportive of my recovery however, recently I’ve been triggered by his eating behaviors.\n\nWe eat dinner together almost every night and he typically eats less than or the same as me. Prior partners I’ve had usually ate much more than I (including before I had an ED) so I’ve never experienced this feeling of self consciousness about portions in front of a bf. My RD suggested I take into account he could be eating more during the day when I’m not with him, so I’ve been trying to ignore this at meals and focus on fueling myself. \n\nThis has been hard but it got worse last week when he shared with weight with me unprompted (I didn’t ask nor did I want to know). He is about 6’-6’1 and I knew the number sounded low, but became concerned when I discovered how low it was compared to I could find online regarding the healthy weight range for his age and height. \n\nFurthermore, last night we were at dinner with his friends (unaware of my ED history) and they were commenting on how little food he ordered (he got the same as me while they ordered ~3x the amount) and saying they couldn’t believe that’s all he ate. He then proceeded to talk about how he used to get injured all the time in sports because of being so skinny. \n\nI’m not sure if I should confront him about my concern or if it’s appropriate considering I’m still in early recovery but even so, I don’t know how to deal with constantly being triggered at meal times. Any advice is appreciated on how to cope or talk to him about it . \n\nTLDR: My bf who is 6’ eats less or the same as me as meals and it’s very triggering and I’m starting to believe he might have disordered eating due to his weight and others also commenting on his intake at meals. \n\n",

One thing that always bring my mood down is my overshoot weight. I keep clinging onto the idea that it will go down. I feel like I can't be happy until it is gone. I know I have a lot of work to do but I am posting this hoping for some helpful advice or to feel less alone.\n\nFor context, my eating disorder started January 2023. I started quasi recovery and slowly gained from January 2024 to April 2024. Then I decided to fully recover in May so I weight restored and overshot by June. I had constant extreme hunger for around 2 months. I got my period back in May and have gotten it monthly ever since. I am currently practicing intuitive eating and relearning to eat again. I get most of my cues, but satiation is still kind of hard. I am able to exercise pretty intensely as well which is nice because I am a college athlete and my sport is very important to me. I feel like my hunger levels are not normalized yet, but very close. Anyway I got new stretch marks and have never felt so unconfident and uncomfortable with my body. My boobs are huge, my stomach still holds lots of fat, and my face is so much chubbier. I just don't feel like myself. It sucks. And I get so angry when people just say \"love yourself\" \"weight neutrality\" like you can say that but I don't think anyone would feel comfortable if they just woke up and weighed significantly more.\n\nI know everyone's body is different and no one knows the answer but does anyone think my overshoot will come off? What did you guys notice when or if your overshoot came off? How long did it take? My weight has been stable for over 3 months now and I am just so sick of it. I have noticed some weight distribution but not much. Is anyone in the same boat as me? How do you stay hopeful? I don't think I will turn to my eating disorder again because I did all this hard work to get here, but I guess I just constantly want to fast forward to when maybe my set point is found and I feel like myself again.\n\nAlso for context I don't mean like loose a bunch of weight when I say loose my overshoot- I just mean the extra amount that I gained. I didn't feel like myself in my underweight body, but I also don't in my overweight body.\n\nAny tips or stories will really help me! Sending love to anyone struggling.",

        "Text": "Did anyone else experience insane body dysmorphia once you started gaining muscle mass / “weight” from healthy eating and exercise habits? \n\nFWIW this might the best I’ve ever looked and felt. My period is back and the only time I feel lethargic is right before bed. Except I can’t help but feel sooooooo dysmorphic and I am obsessed with being frail again. My skinniest weight I had no period and this was a year ago. My new boyfriend mentioned to me when I met that I looked to skinny (said more kindly) and suggested I start lifting weights. He always encourages me to eat more and stay strong. He NEVER says the word skinny as a positive. It’s always built, strong, ripped, athletic, etc…those types of words. But for some reason any time I am getting ready to see him and look in the mirror I think “I’m too fat for him”. I am the healthiest I’ve ever been in my life…\n\nHas anyone else experienced this during the recovery phase? I thought it would get my “dream” toned body and feel safe. ",

But even before that, I always had a really hard time with my body. I always felt too big, and I’m short which makes it even more difficult. Since developing anorexia it’s been so much harder because I just feel like I have no idea what I actually look like. I believe my body right now is mostly average but it’s such a fight to keep it there and not get bigger. the most prominent feeling is just exhaustion. I wake up every day prepared to spend the day fighting to keep my body from getting bigger, constantly thinking about what I’m allowed to eat and how much I’m allowed to eat and being afraid of not restricting enough. I haven’t been restricting as much in the last few months and I’m not in a place where I love my body but I’m in a place where I feel like I’ll probably be OK if I don’t get any bigger. But I feel like it’s such a fight to not get bigger, like I work so hard and I don’t even know if it’s working, and I feel like I’m failing at of the time because I’m eating when I told myself I wouldn’t and I’m terrified that I’m getting bigger again and I just can’t see it yet. I don’t wanna live the rest of my life like this but I don’t know what else to do. Does anyone have any advice? It really feel hopeless ",

Now I'm 17 and I am recovered, however I feel really strange. A couple weeks ago I went to the beach with some people who I didn't know and the thought of being in a bikini in front of other people stressed me so much that I ended up having a small \"relapse\", it only lasted a few days, in which I redownloaded every calories/fast tracker apps, skipped meals ecc, but then I forced myself to stop. Now things are different, I eat without problems lunch and dinner and overall i'm okay. Still, I can't get myself to eat whenever i'm not \"forced\" to (I usually have lunch and dinner with my family so it's hard for me to skip those meal) but I won't eat snacks when I'm hungry and I'm always skipping breakfast, since nobody looks after me in those times.\n I don't know how to feel. I'm afraid this behave will lend to a relapse eventually and I don't know if I have the strength to handle it. I don't know if I'll be able to stop myself from starving or if I even want to. I'm just so disgusted with my body, I'm not sure I can stop myself from relapsing. I don't  know what to do. I was thinking about going back to therapy but my therapist is not specified in eating disorders (I went there because of anxiety) so I don't think she can help me. I feel so lost.",

I’ve been in recovery for about a year and a half and have made a ton of progress, but basically my family think my weight is higher than it is. I obviously won’t get into specifics but I’ve been hiding my true weight for about a year and recently have been making genuine recovery efforts, at least a lot more than I have in that past year. However, I’m getting weighed in a month and while I feel like I can get close to where I’m supposed to be, I feel so horribly guilty for lying to my family. Recently I’ve been wanting support but I can’t be honest about the numbers. If I’m honest about where I am genuinely, they’ll pull me out of law school and I don’t think I could function with that failure. However I feel awful lying about my weight in the meantime. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just support for how horribly dishonest this disorder has made me, but I guess I just needed to vent as I’m feeling particularly disgusted with myself tonight :(",

I gained weight and it was all okay ig. But now im 19 and scared. I feel ugly and not in control, the only thing i can control is food. i dont feel hungry or the need to eat i just feel fine. Even though i know im not. i prefer to eat once a day and thats all. i dont feel the need to keep going, after a small meal i feel full and a need to stop. last year i went to the gym and it was fine, at first i went with friends but later on my own, i just felt ashamed. I felt good and bad when people said i look skinnier. I hope they didn’t think i was ugly before, it gave me the impression that i should keep going. I don’t talk to people about my problems but recently i got a bf who is the best person alive, and he is worried about me, he is trying to help me but i can see that it’s hurting him and thats the last thing i want. He gave me confidence in myself and since we got together i fell pretty like he actually likes me and finds me attractive. It gave me hope I’m not as bad as i thought. i don’t wanna ruin the relationship with my partner and i don’t want him to believe he is at fault. this started way before we started dating. \n\ni was wondering if anyone knows whats the next step i need to use, and how if possible to get better mainly for myself but also for the people who do care about me.

        "Text": "Recently, my partner (22) broke up with me (32m). While we were together they were actively going through an eating disorder.  It was not diagnosed, but it seemed to be showing up as habits of bulimia.  While I have not fully recovered mentally from my anorexia, physically I have been stable for nearly two years.  They would consistently ask me for advice how to deal with eating disorders and what my experiences in recovery were.  If I'm being realistic I brushed the questions off at the time because I was afraid that talking about it would trigger my physical habits again.  I'm not going to sit here and let anyone feel like they can't talk to me anymore.  Remember that these are just my opinions.\n\n-I don't know if it's possible to recover fully mentally or not.  I haven't been able to make it there and most days it seems like I never will.  But I hold out faith every day that I'll look in the mirror and see someone handsome. Sometimes he's pretty cute.\n\n-When you're at your lowest, people are not judging you.  They just want you to be healthy.\n\n-If you're here for a loved one, just try and be gentle with them at all costs like I couldn't be.  It might seem simple to some but you could start to hurt more than you help.\n\n-You are loved and you are worthy of love.  There are people who were in your life before that care whether you believe it or not.  There are people who will love you at any size you might be.  Just try to stop focusing on the ones that do base their love on that.\n\n-I know that I said I haven't fully recovered yet but it can be easier.  I won't even say it gets better because it doesn't. It's something that you need to fight for. It's a hard fight.  A lot of days you'll want to give up, and you might even relapse.  The fact that you're even here reading this in the first place is proof that you have the fight in you.  And I can promise you once you do start to feel better, it's worth it.  Being skinny can feel great, but knowing that strength feels better.\n\nI'm sure all of this has been said here before, in many different ways, possibly even the exact same way.  If you are seeing words like this for the first time though, welcome. I had to read things like I just typed so many times to get where I am.  If this helped you, save it.  If you want to reach out to me, do it.  And to the one person who I actually want to see this post, I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.  This isn't trying to make anything better, I just need to be a better person.",
