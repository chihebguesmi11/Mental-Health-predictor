        "Text": "Schizophrenia might be a conglomeration of symptoms and overwhelming and awful, but it's prevelant across all cultures regardless of socioeconomic status, about 1-2% of the population. \n\nIn my opinion, as a spiritual person or scientific standpoint, I think we are supposed to be the chaotic element, the \"pot stirrer\", the artistic interpretors\n\nBoth spiritually and scientifically, this would prevent humanity from becoming stagnant by injecting a bit of chaos. I don't mean chaos in a bad way but rather in a wild card kind of way. \n\nI think we're also guages to see how the world is going. For instance in a healthy society there's a strong likelihood that the hallucinations wouldn't be persecutory or demanding. Symptoms vary already across cultures. African cultures report hearing family members and ancestral voices as opposed to western culture who report more demonic and oppressive hallucinations. This isn't always the case. \n\nIve been exposed to a lot of Eastern beliefs and practices that have helped me adjust how I see things. Hallucinations that once bothered me have lost most of their power. \n\nI also feel like I'm swimming in the correct current of life now as opposed to always trying to swim like everyone else and judging myself for having a harder current to deal with in the first place \n\nI wanted to say all this because I felt like I was being punished, that I deserved this somehow. I truly felt disabled. I felt like I was wrong for daring to live with this illness \n\nI don't feel that way anymore. I know I have something to offer the world, a glimpse into the abstract world they can't usually perceive. I have the smallest of purpose but it can be so much more \n\nStay strong 🖤",

        "Title": "Homeless brother with schizophrenia ",
        "Upvotes": 19,
        "Text": "My brother (44) was diagnosed with schizophrenia around the age of 21. I'm two years younger than my brother. Our mother died when we were babies and we were raised by our dad. My brother would have episodes but nothing too bad until after our dad died when I was 28 and my brother was 30, then more hospital visits, longer episodes. By 2018 my brother was pretty much homeless. Making poor decisions over and over again which coincided with going off meds. He lived with me from about 2016-2018. Some very delusional moments. The voices are usually very mean to himself. I had to get a roommate to pay my bills so he was never around too much. Occasionally I'd let him sleep on the floor if it was okay with my roommate. Never more then a night or two. By 2022 he pretty much cycled between hospital and jail. Everytime a housing opportunity would arise he have a meltdown and leave. I got pregnant in 2022 and my roommate moved out so I could set up the baby room. My brother shows up when I'm about 8 months pregnant. He is on disability he seem okay. I told him he could stay one month before the baby comes but no alcohol and he had to be on his meds. Things were fine for a couple of days but then he started drinking, unable to eat because something the voices said, started having delusions (probably had them all along but now let them surface), standing on my porch yelling. Got to the point I didn't feel safe being so pregnant and I asked him to leave and it became a very scary situation with him yelling at me and I called the cops.  The cops said they couldn't take him but I could leave! He ended up having a warrant so they did take him. Anyways, it ended with me having to get him evicted even though he didn't live here. Which was multiple trip to the court house and pretty much sucked. The eviction went through (he never came back or fought it because he didn't live here). When my daughter was born he was back on meds said that she would be motivation to stay on track. It lasted three months then he disappeared. Went to jail/hospital. I'm always cautious with him around her. He has never done anything but I just don't trust him anymore and the only thing that matters is my daughter. So part of the whole eviction thing is that he is not allowed to sleep at my house ever again because they said I'd have to evict him again. I now have an almost 2 year old and it's getting cold so my brother has been showing up wanting to spend the night. I can tell he is off his meds or they don't work anymore. So here I am constantly over and over again telling him he can't spend the night. So as I lay awake in my warm bed my brother is outside (probably in my backyard) . There is so much guilt but also I have to stand my ground. I need to protect my home and my mental health and my daughter. This post is long enough so I didn't go into all the things my brother has put me though and himself through but choosing homelessness is horrible just like this disease. Also someone hearing voices and an irrational two year don't go well together. Thanks for listening ",

        "Text": "Here is  \n\nHere is solid proof I am incapable of telepathically communicating with someone.\n\nI detect some error in auditory hallucination, which does not align with reality. Here we go.\n\n \n\n1. angelic voice told that I would become a famous Christian youtuber after I would preach the word of God and met several international psychics. But in fact I was jobless, let alone to meet international psychic.  \n\n \n\n2. The auditory hallucinations mimicked my childhood lawyer friend who wanted to help me and gave me his phone number. When I call the given number it's obviously not in service.\n\n \n\n3. I was told that auditory hallucination that my cousin was psychic, he try to help me out with his power and prophecy my upcoming or incoming death. but I find out from my mom that my cousin is just a taxi driver and I am still alive a year after.\n\n \n\n4. When I tried to commit suicide by drowning, I heard hallucinations that mimicked my ex-girlfriend's voice. My ex-girlfriend said she tried to summon the sea of ​​​​goddess to pull me closer to the shore, actually. In fact, I was really far away from the coast and was never brought closer. I heard EX's voice predicting that I would die in a subway fight. There will be no future for us. In fact, there was no fight on the subway.\n\n My Ex also said I would become a famous Christian youtuber.  I would preach the word of God and met several international psychics. But be aware not to bring home the international psychic because she eventually might betray me.\n\nBut in fact I was jobless instead of a famous Christian youtuber. And EX never come back to me, let alone to betray me.\n\n \n\n5. When I couldn't find the house ownership certificate, I heard a hallucination imitating the voice of my bad neighbor, saying that my mother had told the real estate agent that she put the house under my name and persuaded real estate agent she was actual owner of house, and sold my apartment in secret. I'm very angry. In reality, t I just misplaced my house ownership certificate somewhere else.\n\n \n\n6. I heard voice mimicking a group of gangster, who attempt to end my uncle's life. They want eye for eye and tooth for tooth. They constantly threaten me they would take away my uncle' life if i hesitate to pay the ransom. They would like to beat my uncle's to death in front of my aunty front yard. I never pay the ransom and my uncle is alive. Auditory hallucination informs me of their furious arrival at my aunty's front yard and the fight started. When I showed up at my aunty's front yard, no villians was there.\n\nWhen I attempted suicide by drowning, I had auditory hallucinations imitating gang friends, bosses, relatives saying they would show up and save me from drowning. In fact, they never showed up to the shore to rescue me from the sea, even though they were so close to where I was floating.\n\nThe auditory hallucination imitated a gangster law graduate who wanted to talk to me on the phone, he gave me his phone number and I called him back.  This phone number is not in service.\n\n \n\n7. I heard auditory hallucinations imitating the voice of my boss, who owns a construction company, accusing me of writing down the wrong company name. In fact, I wrote my boss’ construction company name correctly.\n\nAuditory hallucinations imitating the voice of my construction boss saying he paid for investigating my ex-girlfriend abroad and knew she was filing and registering her marriage certificate. In fact, I do not think it’s reasonable to conclude that that he was as well-informed as the nation’s intelligence services.\n\n \n\n8. I heard my auditory hallucinations mimic a friend of mine who worked in the tech industry, who said my boss was harassing him with gang violence, wanted to take away his property, and wanted to have intimate relationship with his daughter. This tech friend described that my boss not only owned a construction company, but he also led a group of gangsters, he was the construction mafia. Anyone who offends my boss will be subject to gang violence.\n\nI asked my tech friend if he ever said that. He said no.\n\nIf my boss was a construction mafia, he wouldn't have to buy an excavator and wooden formwork. He can organize a gang of mafias to commit crimes only because illegal activities are more profitable than construction.\n\nIf they all try to hunt me down physically, I should die a million times over. But my life is intact. I jumped into the ocean and nearly died was out of moral guilt as auditory hallucinations tried to hunt me down mentally. The voice said I had brought them countless sleepless nights. But when I later realized that the hallucinated voices were probably coming from non-existent characters, I realized how stupid and ignorant I had been. I almost died for figure that didn’t exist. I think therefore I am. I am incapable of telepathically communicating with someone.\n\n9. I heard auditory hallucination said that my collection of painting is being discovered. Most of my painting collection is being thrown away by my aunts. When I got back home, I found my painting collection lying undiscovered.\n\n \n\n10. The hallucination said that I had psychic powers and everything would unfold before my eyes. I soon discovered whom the excavator driver was having an affair with.  A few minutes later, I heard the sound of the excavator driver being beaten quickly and brutally by the thugs.  But after careful consideration and examination, I believe this is impossible and unreasonable. The predictive power is ridiculous. As to who is responsible for this imaginary event, I should be that person to be persecuted since I am not actually psychic and prophet. This perhaps just random thought flashed across my mind.\n\n \n\nThe auditory hallucination seems to mimic friends and family members' voice. I ask several friends and family members if I ever communicate with them telepathically. They all replied \"NO\" Here is another solid proof I am incapable of telepathically communicating with someone.\n\n ",

It’s been two years since my first psychotic break and a year since my second (when I tried going off the meds). Now, as long as I continue working with my psychiatrist and therapist, I truly believe I can be the best version of myself despite the challenges of this condition.

        "Text": "I've been diagnosed for about 7 years now, and I've had a variety of symptoms over the years. From delusions to hallucinations, to voices etc. As for my most difficult episodes, I vividly remember two of them. \n\nThe first happened while I was staying abroad for university. I woke up one day and it was like I was back home. My apartment was my childhood home, my parents and sister were there. I could hear them talk, go about their day and for a moment I thought I had gone completely insane. For one of my most rare moments, I called my parents. I wanted to prove to myself that I'm okay. And when I heard them through my phone and not right next to my ears, I managed to get through.\n\nMy second and arguably much more dangerous experience happened while I was working in our family restaurant. I was cutting down bread, and suddenly it felt like I lost control of my hand. I saw the knife getting closer and closer to my neck, and I had to lfight back to get control of myself. Thankfully nothing bad happened, but to this day I'm scared of being close to sharp objects like knives .\n\nIf you feel comfortable sharing, I would like to hear about your experiences.",

Rather, they were just connections between anything and everything that had happened in my life  prior to receiving “sign” made me believe that my delusions were real. When in fact they were not. Coincidences occur a lot more when you’re constantly looking for connections between the past and present especially when you’re schizophrenic. This thought has helped me a lot in overcoming my delusions. I hope it may help some of you too.",

I tried to tell her it wasn't true and listened to her empty recordings she made of the noises she hears in her apartment. I distanced myself from her because she was becoming verbally abusive and would not reason. My sister has been very close with her and does a great job to avoid those triggers. Recently, she had an outburst and wanted to move a third time in two years, within our complex. The landlord denied the request, as he's lost money accommodating her needs. My sister called for a mental health check and since she is not harming herself or anyone else, they could not help. Now my sister is in the same boat as I am and my mother will not speak to her. I am clueless as what to do in this situation. My father passed in 2017 and now I no longer speak with my mother. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated. ",

I've been hallucinating and having delusions since I was a child. I'm 27 now. I'm on meds and they help but the hallucinations and delusions feel like they're right under the surface of everything.  They've ramped up again recently and I had to have my medication dosage increased. I'm waiting for it to kick in but she said it could take a couple weeks. She prescribed me an as needed med but the pharmacy is taking days to fill it. I'm getting so anxious because it feels like things could get bad again. I've been inpatient three times. Once as a 14 year old, the other two in the last three years or so. It's helped every time but I don't want it to resort to that this time. I guess I'm typing all of this out to feel less alone with this condition. Even though I've lived with this for so long, im learning more and more about what's reality for me. The hallucinations even happen when I close my eyes. Does that happen to some of you? Thank you for reading. ",

They’ve are living in parents rental home, but have completely isolated & have not engaged w/family for most of the year. We suspect Schizophrenia based on symptoms & behavior (i.e. delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, light sensitivity-lights are always off & wearing sunglasses, etc). No one has been inside the house in years, so unsure of potential risk or safety hazards & seldom acknowledge or respond to families efforts to engage (via phone, text or home visits). It’s been incredibly sad to experience the progression this year, & family is at a loss on what to do. *They don’t appear to be aware or experience their circumstances as problematic & their unwillingness/lack of engagement has made it impossible to fully assess them, the severity of the situation or provide any support. Finding a balance between respecting autonomy & knowing how/when to intervene has been incredibly difficult.

It really sucks to find out becuase he has been subtly declining as far as finances and physical health. Luckily my dad is dealing with those issues and is the one that informed me of this news. It doesn't seem like he's a severe case, but I think it's a complicated mental disorder. Sure there's the obvious fact of him seeing things that arent there and he knows it isn't real, but I think it can affect decisions and beliefs and other deep thoughts that I would love to talk to him about. I'm assuming he doesn't know I know unless my dad tells him he told me, but I figure my dad will be the \"bad guy\" of guiding him how to handle his finances better, but I guess I'm just wondering what I could do with my relationship to him. I've been encouraging him for years to beleive in himself and to find more rewarding jobs and he's already on a good track to address those concerns, but I guess I wanna be his friend to keep him grounded and secure. Be that person he can call and just have a conversation with and forget about how humiliating his situation is. I empathize becuase I can imagine that's how any man would feel struggling with a mental illness. Wanting to be normal and left alone to make thier own decisions but have to be watched like a child again. I just feel so bad thinking about how he feels about it and trying to hold it together for this long. Thinking he can figure it out on his own and needing help and viewing it as a failure. God it just makes me so sad I love my brother so much and I wish I could convince him to sell his house and bunk up with me and my gf. But like I said he's aware and really isn't that bad of a case in my eyes. Like to a normal person he might be a wreck but I've seen alot worse sadly. I have hope he can dig out with help from me and the rest of my family and gain back some pride. And I'm already proud of him for being able to admit it instead of suffering alone. \n\nI apologize again becuase i only found out about this and few hours ago and still processing and kinda ranting here, but any advice would be helpful. Like is avoiding confrontation a good idea? Would it be bad if he did find out i knew and change the way he talks to me? I'm not offended at all that he didn't tell me because I can understand how bad he would feel being the older brother who wants to help me with my problems but is drowning in his own. He's just a great guy and deserves the world in my humble opinion.",

This isn't the first time and we're waiting for a full evaluation. \n\nI hate having to ask this but... we've begun to notice that she is only having these hallucinations when she's alone in her room. Not at school. Not with her friends. Never with me. She's also told me she believes she might be autistic and bipolar and she thinks she may have DID. I am beginning to be suspect over some of her claims. Especially the DID as she's never had a moment where seemed like a different person. I've tried to explain to her that DID is when your concious creates a completely different person and it would be pretty clear if she had DID. She responded that sometimes her friends think she's acting different. I told her we'll discuss it with the doctor when we have her full evaluation as I didn't want to seem like I was dismissing her concerns. \n\nI don't want her to think I don't take her seriously when she comes to me with her problems, but you can see where I'm having issues believing her. On top of this, when I picked her up from the mental hospital, she told me she had so much fun, it was like she never left from the last time she was there. I also realized she had a choir concert in school the week she was gone and if you missed it, it would be a zero. This would have been the only way it was excused. Aaaalso, the week before, she had run into one of her friends from the hospital while we were shopping...\n\nMy question is: is it possible for you to only experience hallucinations (visual and auditory) when you are alone in a room? Again, I hate to bring something so serious into question, but my gut is telling me that she is not being entirely truthful. I do believe she has depression and anxiety, but I'm not sure about the other conditions she's listed. Thanks.",

I'd just like to share what I have been finding to help with both my positive and negative symptoms. They're so simple just about all of us can implement them, if you haven't already.\n\n* **Walking 20 minutes**. It reduces cortisol (the culprit behind stress, fear, anxiety) a good deal. \n* **Hot bath**. It's not just relaxing and good for aches and pains, but it produces serotonin, which helps to feel calm and relaxed, and can improve sleep. And for a lot of us, lack of sleep increases the chances of entering psychosis. The benefits from my experience are multi-faceted. I take bath in evening, feel relaxed, conk out on my bed.\n\nI know it's so simple it almost seems silly, but not everybody knows so if this helps even one person to better their mental health I am happy.\n\n",

        "Text": "Alright. So, here's my personal story if you will. I am traumatized because my lover of many years has schizophrenia, whith no signs, and no one knew. \n\nI've known her for 8 years. We are married. We have traveled the country together, and tried build a life and another... It's not been easy. But I built these lives around her. I love her dearly. I can't stand to be apart from her. I don't know what I would do without her. I can't imagine a world without her in it. She went into a psychosis, a little over a year ago now. Out of nowhere. And she didn't come out for months, not untill she was medicated anyways. \n\nIn that time, I experienced something that broke me. I'm not the same person. I can't even begin to describe how painful it is when mental illness sudden takes someone from you, someone you adore more than anything, and just twists them into someone else entirely. It hurts so much even now, even though everything seems like it will be all right. I feel like I've been living in a nightmare I cannot escape until recently. Recently I started emerging from this abattoire of heartache, mediocrity and monotony and people all just telling me how I should be, and what I should do. Recently I have found a new calling. Something bigger than me. Something I can really latch onto and try to see through. Something, much more intrinsic than love or fleeting ideals of a simple life with the person I love. And I know how that sounds, but I mean it. \n\nI am only now beginning to process what has happened. As I said I have problems too. Not of the schizophrenic variety, but of a clear reflection of it. I can't process emotions normally. It takes a long time before I feel them. It's always been that way though, I know no other way of living. But it's starting to eat at me. I can feel this fear, gushing in through the cracks in my memories. Creeping into every ambition I might have. I feel so small. I had no idea how cruel life could be to any person. I think I've witnessed and felt more pain in the last couple years than most people could mentally and physically endure. And I am now starting to feel the toll it has taken. \n\nI just want something for myself. Something I can help grow and leave behind when I die as a token of my appreciation for having lived. Just something. Anything really. I'm not desperate, I'm just not so picky anymore. I can't fathom how to have faith in other people at this point. When they could be just as easily ripped away from me like that again and tortured by the world, let alone their own mind. I haven't really stopped crying. Most of it inside. But sometimes it just forces it's way out of me at the most connected moments I have, and I don't have many of those in the first place. I just wish that when I do feel, I could feel something other than sadness again. \n\nI've tried ignoring it, ignoring my memories. But, you can't really forget where you came from you know? The moment you do you're just lost in a void. Somewhere between there and where you're headed. Like I had no idea until now but this has really f**ked me up in the head. Like bad. And it's because I'm trying to move on. I'm trying to take it in stride, but I just can't. I'm not even hung up on anything, it's just a lot to process. Does anyone else feel the way I do? Like, is there anyone out there somewhere who knows my pain? I am sure there is, I'm not stupid, but I need to know... I need to know that someone else is also feeling this right now and I'm not alone. I need to confirm it for myself. ",

I guess I was aware I was in 'psychosis'. Last night the delusion suddenly left me, and what I'd like to figure out is whether this is something that is a common characteristic of schizophrenia or whether it could be something else.\n\n I should also add that I have Aspergers so I cannot confirm most of the negative symptoms but confirm that I don't have anhedonia.",

Before I start I'm fine now and my friend is very much real thank god...\n\nToday was a stressful day scheduled whise. I honestly don't normally have episodes that involve real people. The last time I had one it was with a senior in my school while I was in freshman year. But this time it was full set. I was already having hallucinations involving lights today. It's just periods where I could only see black and white or lights are just all over and it's like if someone flash banged you with a lamp... But there was no lamp and you just see the lights still in you eyes for like an hour or two... So I was just struggling today...\n\nBasically I was doing something with my friend and I talked a lot with him today. And the voices in my head started asking me. \"Are you sure you didn't make your friend up?\" And then my mind when on a frenzy. Questioning if \"is he actually real?\" And \"I've made people up before so maybe he's like one of those times\". And I started freaking the fuck out. I was hyperventilating and the whole nine yards. So I decided to text him since he was still in the building. I decided asking him where he was and luckily he responded pretty quickly but he misspelled a word which made me walk to another place in the building thinking he was there but he was not.... So I asked him again and he gave it to me but spelt right this time. And the whole time my visions swirling and all over the fucking place. And I start thinking what if I'm hallucinating are texts too... And I start freaking out and run to where he's at... And when I finally see him I call his names and he walks over and I just start balling as I grab this man making sure I can feel him physically making sure he's real. He's looks at me and just tries calming me down as I cry. And I start rambling about my delusion and everything and tell him that I need to touch him right now to make sure he's real. And he fully just hugs me and kept telling me he was real. And a way he made it better was pulling over some of are mutual friends and cracking jokes about how he knows they hate that he's real and how he bets they would love to think he was fake. I was honestly so thankful for him in that moment. He also not a very touchy person but he fully hugged me to calm me down. It was just so nice and like oml thank god it was him out of all people. And he never seen me have an episode before but somehow he was amazing during it. Like I think that was the fastest I calmed down too.\n\nAnyways cheers to an amazing ass friend! ",

I used to think it was aliens but then I heard from a couple of really dark entities so then I thought demons. Now I think its just brought on by brain damage. But everyday I speak to these voices and they talk back. Sometimes friendly, usually they say they are gonna kill me or eat me alive. (While I see images of horrible creatures with scary teeth.) If I come out saying horrible and hurtful things to the voices they just get worse. They comeback yelling, screaming, growling and hissing back at me. None of it happens in my head it happens through me. Is this actually schizophrenia or does this sound like something else?",

Like i'm faking it and wasting everyones time or something.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this or similar?\n\nTyping this out made me realise that maybe the diagnosis is right, i just don't feel very sick compared to the people i got to know. Like i have some sort of imposter syndrome. But i feel like everyone is treating me like i am sick. How do i deal with this?",

        "Text": "Hello, \n\nFirst time poster. Have been lurking here for about 2 years when my husband was first hospitalized. He's been unmedicated for over a year and it's been absolute hell but I've been as stubborn as ever to get him well. Dealing with his paranoia and mental abuse. I've done everything I could to modify my life to fit his needs because I know he can't help it. Meanwhile being very supportive and patient and validating. I've read both LEAP books several times and have spent a grotesque amount of money on consultations with Dr Amador himself all for the sake of being able to communicate with my husband. Recently, during a psychotic episode he confessed to me that he had multiple affairs almost a decade ago (i verified it before you ask if it's a delusion). It would have been less than a year into our marriage when he did this. At the time he was a police officer and dealing with some trauma and hated his job. Fast forward to now and he's a diagnosed schizophrenic. I've read so much about personality changes and out of character behavior. My husband's illness has absolutely manifested slowly but I didn't see the signs. His mom has schizophrenia as well but I still would have never guessed he'd develop it. His paranoia though started with his family years ago. He was still very close to his friends who were also police officers. He never became the isolated stereotype although like I said he barely wanted to spend time with his family or mine. I say this because I know there's a strong isolation factor that would make an affair impossible but that's just not how it manifested in him. \n\nAnyway, when he told me, I grabbed my things and left and told him I had had it. He quickly changed his tune and called me saying he'd do anything. That was my opportunity to tell him flat out he needed to allow the \"cover story\" i.e., antipsychotics. He agreed. I'm now torn. I'm watching this man finally get better (very slowly) while he \"fights\" to get me back because it's the FBI who planted those women and it's the FBI who is forcing us apart. \n\nMy question is... is it possible my husband was not in his right mind when he did that to me? I don't want to lay it out but the level of depravity and coldness is beyond a one time mess up. It was months and crossed into my home. It's like he became a sociopath briefly and then suddenly became himself again. To say this is out of character is an understatement. We've known each other since we were 15. I believe I know him very well. My struggle is that I've been training myself to separate the illness from the person and now I'm questioning who he is. He says he wants a life with me but... I was here willing to do anything in any way to get him better and earning his trust little by little only to find this out. He's still in his own world but his mood is much better. I haven't seen the man I fell in love with in so long. Years before his full psychotic break I was starting to resent him because his opinions on politics and the way he treated me was changing. Slowly everything I watched and listened to had become a topic of how I was easily influenced by \"suggestion.\" I kept thinking it would get better and it only got worse. Now I might see that guy I knew forever ago but maybe I never even knew him at all.\n\nHe's not even in the right frame of mind yet to give me the answers I need. Hes been medicated for a little over a week. He has been out of his mind these past two years. Completely psychotic with no insight at all so to say I've been waiting for this moment is an understatement. I love him very much. It's hard to believe that the person I knew him to be was never really him. \n\nAll of your opinions and comments would be appreciated.",

He tells me it's him not me to leave him alone and give him space but then he tries to hurt himself. \n\nHe always comes back after a spiral. But the things he says when he spirals are so hard to hear. He doesn't want to hurt me. Doesn't want me to see him when he is suffering. Insists on suffering alone. He won't communicate with me. Completely shuts me out. Says he is tired of talking. He refuses to see that the thing that hurts the most is watching him suffer alone. I feel so helpless. \n\nAll he left was a note\n\nAt hospital\n\nSo weak\n\nI'm sorry\n\nHe doesn't need to be sorry. I just want him to find happiness. I want him to find peace. But the voices won't let him have it. \n\nIdk if I'm hurting or helping. I always welcome him back with open arms. I always forgive him because he is not his disease. He knows I love him and I know he loves me. He is my best friend. I just feel like I can't get through. Like my voice is just one in the chorus he hears. \n\nAnd I struggle too with my own mental health. I try to be there but feel like such a failure. I want to be a light for him a rock in this world but I don't know how. He's spent his whole life abused or alone and he is convinced he is too broken. That he is holding me back. He isn't. He keeps me going in this world that feels like it's falling apart around us. He is worth loving. He deserves happiness.\n\nI've called 911 to save his life multiple times. He is going to therapy and taking meds. But the spiral always comes eventually. And I just sit here and watch helplessly. He screams at me to leave him alone. When he pushes me away he says he hates me. Calls me names. Anything to get me to leave him alone. So now when he says to just go I go. Because i know that hurting me hurts him even more. So I sit on the other side of the wall while he drinks and cries. \n\nUntil he leaves somehow, either in an ambulance or to the hospital in a cop car or on his own. \n\nMy mom is actually supportive. She keeps reminding me that it's just his mental illness. That he is working through a lifetime of trauma. That he will call and come back that he doesn't hate me he is just suffering. To be patient. Or let him go. \n\nI'm scared I'm the one holding him back. Maybe I should let him go so he doesn't have to worry about me. So he can focus on himself. But would he really, really be happier alone? No one deserves that. \n\nHe has social security. He's been on the streets before. Sometimes he says it was good, freeing, other times he breaks down saying how scared he is to go back and how he is getting too old for it (39m).\n\nI've done everything in my power to prove to him I'm genuine. That I'm loyal. That he can trust me. And I believe he trusts me more than anyone he has ever known. But the voices are always there. \n\nI hate this disease with every fiber of my being. I hate that life is so cruel to someone who is so so amazing. \n\nHe left this morning. Idk if he has been transferred to inpatient yet. Idk when or if he will call. He always does but I always wonder if this will be the time he runs away like he always says he wants to. Idk what to do when he calls. \n\nDo I just do what I always do and tell him I love him and I'mhere for him? Is that really enough and does he even want to hear it? He may just call to ask to get his stuff. How do I stop from breaking down? How do I stay strong and not beg? What do I say? How do I act like it's all going to be okay when I don't know if it will be?\n\nI'm so so lost right now. And so is he.",

        "Upvotes": 5,
        "Text": "(WARNING: VERY LONG POST but would mean the world if you could read and reply) For awhile now, I've always had this thought or theory lingering in the back of my head but I never let it get to me like how it did a few years ago. I managed to find a way out of that loop the first time because I got tired of it and just figured that this is how things are and I can't change it if it's true. But as of now, i think it is worse than before, and there's reasons behind it. There have been weird things happening to me lately, like synchronicities, false memory and glitch in the matrix situations that are hard to explain. And there have been more in the past that are so hard to explain but I always dismissed and made a possibility for. But why am I thinking now that someone is trying to tell me something? I just wish it was a different conclusion but somehow it ended up coming down to the truman show delusion and I can't seem to get out of it. \n\nWhile I've had this delusion for the past week, I've been having a mix of emotions. Sometimes I tell myself that what you're thinking is absurd and is most likely not true and then it goes away for a bit. But then when I think things are going well, my brain switches back to the thought of the delusion and then the loop starts all over again. Also during this, I've been stressed so much that there's moments where I really need to talk to someone I love who will give me the affection I need, and it's mostly been my girlfriend. But I have not told her about this delusion  thing because I don't want her to think I'm crazy. I've also thought \"why aren't there more people in the world with this thought?\" because as far as i know, it doesn't seem to be very common. And then the thought of that makes me overthink more and makes me think that I'm the special or chosen one and someone of a higher power is trying to tell me something. \n\nNow I will discuss these \"weird events\" that have been happening\n\nThe first event that took place was that I was driving out of the parking lot from my work and i looked both ways like 2 or 3 times, and saw absolutely nothing on the road. To be fair I kind of drove out of there quickly but I swore that I saw nothing on the road. Absolutely nothing, not even anything that would be remotely close to me. As soon as I take my left turn, I hear a honk and there's a car in the lane I crossed over next to me. I was completely confused and in shock. I thought I was going to be in an accident but it didn't happen. The car just appeared there and drove past me. I looked over to the driver and he didn't even look at me, just kept going and minding his business. My thoughts turned straight to a sudden glitch in the matrix and then kind of got worse after that. I thought of the delusion, but I didn't let it get to me. The whole situation definitely freaked me out, but eventually I got over it and dismissed it as a car maybe in the other lane of the parking lot who was also taking a turn that I didn't see. \n\nMoving on to a few days later, I went to go see my girlfriend at her college and we went to a halloween party. She got really drunk and it escalated into me having to carry her to the shuttle stop that takes us back to her dormitory.  We eventually got back in her dorm and I tried to get her all cozy in her bed before she passed out. Like 10 minutes before she passed out, she starts talking about this show called jury duty which is kind of like the truman show but in real life and was made into a tv series. She started talking about it out of nowhere and for some reason it triggered my thoughts I had 2 or 3 days before. It doesn't sound like a huge coincidence, but it felt like it to me. I just thought to myself, \"out of all the things you want to talk about, you bring the one thing up that would attempt to make me lose my mind.\" And then i just delved deeper into the thought and wondered \"what if this coincidence is some kind of message that the guy who is in jury duty is somehow me in real life.\" Sounds very stupid, but it was scary. While I was pretty drunk as well, I stupidly asked \"am i in a show like that right now?\" And she didn't answer the question and kept going on about it, which i think is because she probably was confused and drunk and didn't know what i was talking about. But i thought about it all night until the next day and I dismissed it that day once again. \n\nThough I stopped thinking about it that day, I was left on edge and overthinking about the possibility of it being real until it came into full effect recently. And now recently, I have had \"false memories\" aka \"the mandela effect\" which is when you remember an occurence that never actually happened. My girlfriend was over at my house and I was watching this movie called \"the invitation\" with her. The plot is that the main character's ex-wife invites him and his new girlfriend over along with their old friends to plan a nice reunion. But what is found out is that the ex-wife and her husband are actually crazy and try to make them stay until they try to kill the entire group. Now from what I remember from the movie when i watched it before is that one of the characters, Claire, wanted to leave because she was becoming uncomfortable, and the main character, Will, walked her out to her car. In the same scene that I saw with my girlfriend, she actually walked out with one of the murderers going out there with her. I was honestly shocked because I vividly remember that not happening. \n\nThe last thing that I want to mention is something that happened to me a year ago, but might be reoccuring again. In a way, it's somewhat humorous and would probably not have been the greatest time to happen during an event like the pandemic in 2020. My toilet paper rolls in my personal bathroom were always running on empty so often, even only a couple days after I put a new one up. The weird thing is, is that I never really go #2 in my bathroom all that much, so I knew something was up. No one else I live with goes in my bathroom as far as I know, and there would be no reason for my mom and her boyfriend (the only two people I live with) to take mine since they use what is upstairs all the time. Just today, I knew that I had a little bit of a roll left not too long ago and it just vanished. I could not find it anywhere. I was also confused by this as well. \n\nThere are a few other little things have happened but this is all I will cover. My point is behind all of this, is why is all of this weird stuff happening to me at once? I don't even care that much to find the solution to each event, but I feel like the universe is trying to tell me something. This also includes that I feel weird about everything that has happened and feel like it means something, which I'm thinking that it does, but my brain has the worst possible conclusion for it. I have thought about other conclusions like I've jumped timelines or these signs are not what I think they mean, but it always goes back to the worst that doesn't make me feel good at all. Maybe this will all go away like it did the first time, but as of right now, I'm not sure what to do. ",

We're at new issue.\n\n**He is not a danger to himself or others, so o have been told. His hallucinations are based in he needs to protect people. I am new to his care and am at a loss with what I'm seeing. \n\nHe cannot hold a job. If not for my dad, he wouldn't have one. He's on disability as well. He refuses to use a phone (smart or flip phone). He refuses to get a place to stay (he's living in his car). I have asked if he has a social worker and my head got torn off. He has said he is fine and doesn't want or need help. \n\nThis part is where it sounds selfish. My dad is in and out of the hospital with issues. My uncle is a massive stressor for him. Having my uncle cared for in some way that's not us doing it would take a massive amount of stress off my dad, and improve his health. My aunt agrees but claims she can only do so much. My dad almost didn't come home last time and something has to give. \n\nMy uncle was ranting at my dad in the hospital about how everything is dad's fault. Dad got him the truck, a job, a doctor, food, and more. But it's not enough. Yelling about how dad \"owes him\" for \"protecting him\" all these years and how dad should just cut him a check. About how the illness came on cause he stopped \"protecting \" him to show him. We used to find \"protection charms\" around the yard - balls of tinfoil, folded paper with drawings, etc that he would leave. He would become irate when we moved them. \n\nI need to know what resources I can look at our contact. I want to help them both but I can't financially, and I do not want my uncle to be further into the streets, but I refuse to give handouts cause frankly, i can't afford them and neither can the rest of the family. uncle refuses to take meds and refuses to take control of his own life (I may sound callous, not trying to. I don't know what he goes through but I need to do something so my dad doesn't stress further ). It seems he expects us to fund everything for him, he tells everyone were wrong and that \"they are coming unless I'm here\", and do not get him started on politics, Trump is his God right now to the point where it's scary. He's incredible at at and is a wordsmith and can convince a person to do anything, but he doesn't care about his surroundings (he was kicked out of his last place because he let it descend into filth. I do not know if this is a symptom or of its him). \n\nI've been thrown into this and don't know where to start.  I need to help my uncle to help my dad and we (mum and i) are scared dad won't survive his next heart episode. \n\nNo one will answer my questions and I'm terrified I am going to lose both my uncle and my dad. Located in CA.\n\nMy uncle is a kind man who has issues and I am not demonizing him at all. I'm trying to just give facts but it's a really emotional, stressful situation. I don't know how to approach him, or even talk to him about this. I don't know what to do when he goes into a rage tirade or how to neutralize it. I don't know how to lay out boundaries in a way he will understand. I don't know how much of what we're seeing is his disease in action vs him just being a dick (when he was on his meds he was lovely though he claimed it felt like he was a robot. Him off his meds I don't know how to separate anything).\n\nI'm sorry for the novel. I just need help so I can help them. ",

        "Text": "So my bf is undiagnosed and I'm looking for advice here. Up until two years ago he was a pretty normal guy. Now he's totally different. He seems constantly paranoid and very tense. He always tells me he thinks people are out to get him, he's terrified of answering unknown calls, hides whenever I order for example pizza to the house. He will legit run and hide the second the delivery person even pulls in the driveway. I also let him fall sleep before me because he feels like people are watching him and are gonna strike the second he closes his eyes so he likes me too \"guard\" him. I've also noticed hes become very anti social. Besides when he's working he won't do anything and just stay in the house and lay in bed. He also started to act miserable and very negative. He has a obsession with Christianity and burning down churches. He'll go on rants about how much he hates it and that christanity is a evil cult. Deals with very strong intrusive thoughts. He said he thinks about murdering people brutally and slowly and that he's scared he will actually do something like that because the feeling are so strong. Intense hate and depression. He makes death and suicide jokes. He seems like his empathy is disappearing and sometimes is just straight up evil and cruel to people. He'll act like the victim even though it's his fault. He has intense mood swings, seems like intense feelings of hatred and depression. He says he wants to kill himself brutally In front of people just to traumatize them. Last week I saw his search history and a lot of it was sucide related stuff. Lastly He'll seem to go \"insane\" sometimes by laughing like a mad man while crying so badly he falls to the floor and starts having trouble breathing. I promise he was never like this before and I'm only saying this because I'm very concerned. We both want him to get into therapy but can't afford it. He told me he desperately wants help and he's scared of what's happening to him. I'm sorry this was a lot. This is kinda a cry for help on what to do. I wish so badly I could help him but I can't, we can't afford therapy...etc so i thought asking you guys might be able to help us. Thank you.",

The worst was 10 years ago when an ER injected her *10 mg of haldol*, which caused a Dystonic reaction that has traumatized her. She wasn’t even unusually psychotic during the incident; she was extremely agitated from a panic attack. Her psychosis was there but she says the panic was rooted in a real event that happened.  \n\nShe has never tried an atypical antipsychotic. She takes other psych meds like antidepressants and benzos. By controlling her anxiety and depression and OCD, they make it possible for her to kind of live with the hallucinations. \n\nI really want her to try a low dose of a newer antipsychotic like vraylar or latuda or seroquel. I think she might like not having psychosis, and the other meds don’t work that well. It’s really exhausting for her to keep the schizophrenia under control through willpower. \n\nI think I’m  going to take her to see my psychiatrist and pay out of pocket because the ones she sees at the low cost clinic aren’t the best. But she’s waitlisted until February. If it’s guaranteed that she is going to have another Dystonic reaction I might cancel the appointment because she doesn’t have a problem getting her meds at the low cost clinic. My psychiatrist office is quite expensive without insurance (they don’t take Medicaid).\n\nSo yeah , has anyone had a Dystonic reaction and gotten back on antipsychotics? Especially interested  if the new drug was helpful.",

They misplaced words completely in sentences and they also jumped from subject to subject. This symptom is very recent. \nI do not know what is going on. Brother only takes Zolpidem as needed for insomnia. They do not drink. They smoke occasionally but have not even touched marijuana in their life. I want my brother back. They are surprisingly doing well at work (they work hybrid so about 50/50 in office/from home). They did say only one coworker noticed their speech difference but it was brushed off as them being tired. Brother is not going to a doctor because they do not want the label of being insane. How do I get them to get them back to being normal. They work as a case manager and have influence like a social worker on placing people in halfway houses and they are afraid the label of being mentally ill will have them loose their job and/or get their hunting rifle they use for shooting deer taken away.

I've since benefited from a lot of the psychological and pharmaceutical treatments that come with having a diagnosis--I don't hear voices anymore, I can mostly manage my paranoia and delusions, etc. \n\nBut one of the ways I've been processing my diagnosis is through writing--personal essays, more specifically.\n\nA boutique publisher is putting out a collection of those essays next month. The book is called *Until At Dawn We Wake: Gender, Madness, Theology*, and it's all about my experiences of psychosis, gender dysphoria (I'm trans...), and God. I'm sure it would be of interest to some of y'all, and if so, I'd love it if you'd read it.\n\nYou can pre-order the book via the links on my website: [www.charlottedalwood.com/until-at-dawn-we-wake](http://www.charlottedalwood.com/until-at-dawn-we-wake)\n\nHere's a **Synopsis**:\n\nThrough a series of compelling personal essays, *Until At Dawn We Wake* reexamines three of the centering points of Christian theology—creation, sin, and redemption—by asking what light gender dysphoria and psychosis can shed on the Christian religious experience. Written with an urgency born of the author’s personal experience grappling with the subjects she engages, this book breaks novel ground in such areas as disability theory, anti-carceral politics, and feminism. \n\nAre schizophrenia and related psychotic illnesses forms of neurodivergence, and what difference does it make for our doctrine of creation? What does it mean for the modern disability rights and feminist movements that the largest psychiatric facilities in North America are prisons, and how should this fact shape our understanding of sin and damnation? What can paranoid delusions tell us about the nature of faith and revelation? How might our theology be shaped by the ongoing abuse crisis plaguing Christian churches, in which 2SLGBTQ+ people are far more likely to be victimized than their non-queer peers? *Until At Dawn We Wake* explores these and other questions through a combination of tenacious reporting, critical analysis of cultural objects, and personal reflection. \n\n[The book's front cover](https://preview.redd.it/8mbg3q5s5a0e1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3891a38ef4d86b74f206cfc31a51854a91484b38)\n\n",

I take modafinil (100 mg), but the dose keeps increasing with limited effect, and my doctor suggests it’s likely a mental block related to schizophrenia.\n\n**Strategies I’m Currently Using**\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far to manage my sleepiness while studying:\n\n(i)Phonk Music – Keeps me awake and engaged, unlike light music, which I suspect might make me drowsy.\n\n(ii)Binaural Beats – Helps with alertness, likely by creating mental stimulation.\n\n(iii)Exercise – Short runs raise my heart rate, which helps me stay awake.\n\n(iv)Study Breaks – I use 15-minute focused sessions followed by a 5-minute break with non-addictive games like Sudoku or concentration games\n\n(v)Affirmations – Repeating ‘I am not sleepy’ keeps me alert.\n\n(vi)Breathing Exercises – Fast mouth breathing or 5-5-5-5 (inhale-hold-exhale-hold for 5 seconds each) helps sustain focus.\n\n(vii)Speaking Out Loud – Saying my thoughts aloud of things I am trying to learn helps me stay on track\n\n(viii)Fasting – I’ve found this surprisingly effective in improving my alertness only problem is I will be hungry\n\n**Using Sleepiness as a Learning Cue**\n\nI also realized that sleepiness often strikes when I’m studying something challenging or where I lack understanding. So, I treat drowsiness as a signal to revisit those areas to build mastery.\n\nI’ve also been exploring **fringe awareness and hypnagogic states** to generate creative ideas. While this approach doesn’t directly help with my grades, it’s been valuable for long-term insights and as a researcher.\n\n**Looking for More Ideas**\n\nIf anyone has ideas for strategies that make creative use of sleepiness in learning, or ways to stay alert without medication, I’d appreciate your input!\n\n(I used AI to improvise my typing as I am having trouble clearly communicating my ideas maybe because of schizophrenia)",

        "Text": "Hi guys,\nMany of you responded to a previous post of mine where I introduced myself a 44F newly diagnosed.\nMany of you had reached out and some of you even wrote detailed messages of support, kindness and tips. So I wanted to share a quick update and my gratitudes.\n\nI ended up getting a second opinion as the original prescription list had me a bit concerned with dropping duloxetine cold turkey and starting Prozac 300mg instead, along with Olanzitine (something like that) and a neurological pain med for fibromyalgia.\nThe second opinion gave me the same diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder and CPTSD, but the meds direction made me feel much better since were only increasing Duloxetine and adding the Olanzi… and the neuro pain killer.\n\nI’ve been taking them since last Monday, and me being brutally sensitive to anything I take or eat, I felt a major difference on day 2.\nThe main voice I used to hear, my nemesis as I call it, it’s gone. Now I haven’t done anything particularly stupid lately but still. It’s usually there when I wake up and starts talking shit before I even face the mirror. Which I hardly ever did because of it.\nBrushing my feet doesn’t feel as challenging. Receiving calls or messages doesn’t send me into a borderline panic attack. I used to have multiple hours-long fictional conversations internally and externally, and they would get set from a single word or sight of something totally banal. And I would be in conversations the entire time I’m driving. Sometimes some really extreme talks. I don’t think I’ve had one since the meds. I still have my creativity and interest and borderline obsessions with learning about the wide array of topics I’ve always obsessed over. But I’ve only had one 3 or 4 hour pacing and talking to myself session in a week. Before the meds I think I was on earth per se for maybe 3 hours a day? \nI still have my paranoia when I’m locking or unlocking a door. And when I’m sitting in my car while parked anywhere. But no anxiety or feeling “too seen” at stoplights.\nThere’s more and I expect there will be more as long as I keep taking my meds and keep being self aware. But for now, this is a lot, and it feels good. It’s not that feeling of “oh my god I could run through a brick wall”, it’s just good. Stable. Nothing dramatic and magical or morbid. Just.. dare I say it? Peace?\n\nNow, \nI want to wholeheartedly thank you all for sending me all those kind messages. They meant the world to me and truly helped me feel so much less alone and vulnerable. You helped me a lot that day. As it really was quite the brutal experience. So please, accept my gratitudes for all your kind words and know that you’re wonderful, and have truly helped at least one soul find its way out of drowning.\n\nAgain,\nThank you all.\n\nPS: since my diagnosis is not exactly schizophrenia is it ok if I keep posting on here?\nThe schizoaffective group seems to be dead..",

It just gets difficult because a lack of sound (I live in the woods, so no background sound like there would be in a city) and while I put on a story at night to help add to some sound snd have even started putting my headphones on and listening to a video or a movie I’m still struggling to sleep. The only time I don’t struggle to sleep is when my boyfriend is over but we are long distance so I only see him on occasion. Does anyone have any suggestions? I’ve tried just about everything, but I’m still struggling. I even have a cocoon of blankets and plushes to help but they only do so much. Any advice is appreciated.",

My therapist, who is a licensed psychologist, has told me in the past that I'm schizophrenic and autistic. My roommate/best friend also thinks this. However, my parents don't agree, and I'm not sure I do either.\n\nI think my therapist is just saying that, and my friend is agreeing with the dramatic answer. I think I just have high anxiety and get dramatic about it. I don't think it's really schizophrenia. I think my therapist knows this but for some reason isn't telling me. Maybe so I solve it the hard way? Or so I keep going to therapy? I want to stop my meds because I don't think I need them. I can pull it together on my own. It's probably just anxiety that got out of hand. Should I confront my therapist with this? When I mentioned going off meds she seemed highly concerned. But I feel like there's some other reason she's not telling me. I don't think its for risk of psychosis.",

I don't want to dream (or have no memory of them at least) because I wake up affected by the dream emotionally and cognitively. I take Prazosin (Minipress) for nightmares but after not having any recollection of dreams at all for 5+ years, I no longer want to experience them and they've recently become every night.

        "Text": "I've been dating my partner for a few months now, and things were going really well until recently when I started noticing some signs of schizophrenia. While I'm not a doctor, I’m studying mental health, so I had some understanding of what might be happening. At first, when he went on a passionate rant about how the earth is flat, I was uncertain. I realized that just because someone believes in something like that doesn't mean they have a mental health issue; it could simply be a difference in perspective.\n\nHowever, the second incident hit me differently. I shared a lighthearted moment about how I playfully talk to my dog, and I asked if he does the same with his cats. To my surprise, he told me he communicates telepathically with his cat. I chuckled, thinking he was joking until I saw a look of genuine shame on his face. It broke my heart to realize he was being serious.\n\nI confided in a friend about my concerns regarding his mental health and how unsure I felt about how to handle the situation. They suggested giving him space, but I really like him, and I want to support him. I’m not great with dates, but a memorable night came when we were on video chat, and he shared some pretty intense thoughts. He mentioned seeing his parents as aliens and he saw himself as God. In that moment, I tried my best to apply what I learned in my studies to help him navigate his feelings.\n\nAfter some time, he opened up about having been hospitalized more than five times before. Knowing that someone can go through such experiences and still embrace life is honestly inspiring to me. When I asked him to share more about his diagnosis, it was confirmed: schizophrenia and psychosis. Our conversation lasted around four hours, and while it was intense, I felt like I learned so much about him and his struggles.\n\nI didn't confirm or deny his beliefs .For instance, I asked him about his belief in knowing everything, which led to questions that gently challenged his perspectives. I was relieved to hear that the conviction about his alien parents seemed to fade over time. Unfortunately, the God delusions is tough and stuck .\n\nAfter that deep conversation, I found myself reflecting on everything we talked about. I truly want to support him, but I’m unsure if I'm handling this properly or if it’s appropriate to pursue a romantic relationship while he’s experiencing these challenges. Can someone in a psychotic state truly give consent? I’m here to learn and understand better, no judgments. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

There’s nothing actually dead, but it’s probably a bad spirit or something idk. \n\nI guess, part of why I keep returning to spirituality is that I love the freedom aspect of it + the main reason being that I wanted to finally connect to ‘my’ family. I don’t have a good family that sees me as a person tbh, and I just wanted to connect with those beyond the physical. \n\nAnd the reason i stopped believing?? (well the nail on the coffin? -> a group of ‘christian’ friends that invited everyone else to an engagement party except me. tbh letting them altar my belief system isn’t mature or good. but i felt extremely hurt that these people that i went to events with and gave my all too, didn’t even send me a single text over the summer….)\n\nBut, it’s not working to well tbh. Seems like I’m relying on coincidences (‘universal timing’) and contradictory/scattered bits of knowledge that every other spiritual person has, so you can buy their new spiritual oil/soap/candle/etc.\n\nI’ve never fully turned my back on Christianity because I still love the concept of angelic beings and I think Jesus was a real person. I feel these past couple days, God’s been tugging at my heartstrings to follow him fr. But I don’t want it to be a delusion. I feel like a foolish woman tbh 🤷🏾‍♀️.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nr/SchizophrenicWomen",

Every time we would walk through this hallways he would take the time to close every single shutter because leaving them open was \"dangerous\".

Now i can no longer think, literally, i cant think anymore i have to do things off of just first thought because i cant think any deeper than that anymore. i cant imagine things without it controlling my imagination and it constantly talks as internal dialogue which stops me from being able to read or think for myself.",

        "Text": "Somebody on reddit once replied to me, saying \"If you think medication is like a lobotomy, then I can't talk to you.\" Fair enough, we all have different experiences. But before I was medicated my mind and brain were so fluid, and my thoughts were so big and importance-seeming, that administration - ngl - was a f\\*cking shock to the system to say the least! It did feel in fact just like I had been lobotomised, and I felt like I couldn't think and that I was brain damaged for many years after that. It remains among the top five traumatic experiences of my life. No wonder we come off meds. \n\nFor those of us who are new to meds, some of us will hate them. The doctors and psychiatrists who do medicate us, well I think they have a lot to answer for, it being that their prescribing something that they do not have, and will never have, the *slightest* clue about the feeling it gives us. It numbs the brain, takes away your thoughts and moreover it hurts, a lot of the time. \n\nBut it seems to make us behave ourselves. So there's their reasoning. \n\nBut I just want to say, we schizophrenics are among just 1% of the population, and we are the only ones that know what it's like to take medication. I sometimes think that I would like everybody in the world to know what it feels like. Because I want people to know that this stuff should be illegal - more illegal than some class A recreational drugs. But in reality, I want nobody to know what it feels like. It shouldn't exist, it sucks that bad. \n\nBut I'm forty five years old, so I should be used to it. And I guess I am, that I've learned to live with it, and I'll never come off it. But I still complain about it whenever the mood takes me, although I try to put a lid on it, you know? \n\nI just want to say though, that we schizophrenics are in a way fortunate that we have an experience that is so rare, that only one percent of the population know what it's like. And also, while we can relate to each other through our psychosis and psychotic experiences, we can relate through the way we're treated. \n\nI personally can't wait for Elon's Neuralink to come up with his brain chips, so that we can deal with this problem in a new way. \n\nAnyway, I suppose medication is better than psychosis, really. Still sucks balls though. ",

These beliefs made me suffer without realizing I didn’t have to be or that these things were explained by something. \n\nAnd it’s all (largely) because of poor media representations of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and psychosis.\n\nI had no other point of reference, because media representation is so poor, and the fact that it’s so poor only further contributes to keeping psychotic disorders less visible, since people who have them know they’re stigmatized and being open about their experience outside of communities of peers tends to lend painful results. \n\nThis isn’t to say we owe anyone being visible when it doesn’t feel safe for us to do so. What I’m saying is it is sad and the result of a failure on the part of society that we get trapped between invisibility and stigma. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since I was gaining weight on olanzapine, the doctor increased my rxulti dose to 4 mg and slowly stopped taking olanzapine. I did stop gaining weight, but I fell into a kind of depression (absolute discouragement from everything). They increased my lamotrigine to 100 mg and started me on brintellix 5 mg. After 2 weeks of taking brintellix, the discouragement subsided, but I developed significant cognitive problems - I am unable to absorb new information, i.e. read, listen to a podcast, or even watch stupid series. additionally I am terribly suppressed (impoverished world of thoughts, feelings - I have the impression that I am intellectually vegetating). I have a feeling that rxulti did not suit me and most of the problems come from this drug and that all these further steps are only to camouflage the fact that it did not suit me. I would like to change the neuroleptic, but the psychiatrist says that it will be possible in the future. I am very tired of all this and I am afraid that the effect will be that I will end up on a disability pension. the doctor wants to wait for my depression to pass, and I know that my sadness is closely related to my condition and it will not pass until I get back to myself (at least to some extent).

I remember that I was quickly brought out of the worst parts of psychosis in like one week, but I was probably slightly psychotic for a month after that. \n\nMy emotions were really intense during that first month in hospital but I also had some really bad anxiety attacks. In the beginning these anxiety attacks felt like regular anxiety attacks albeit stronger and more psychotic in nature but gradually the anxiety began feeling different. In a way more blunted but also a bit more like the anxiety were penetrating my soul (if that makes sense).\n\nSo I am wondering if my illness were continuing to develop while I was hospitalized, and that the strong emotions and anxiety attacks caused my emotional numbness and anhedonia, and the change in the way I perceived the anxiety attacks where somehow me witnessing brain damage unfolding. \n\nI am speculating here - but I am curious to hear how other people experienced it when they developed anhedonia and emotional numbness. \n",

Along with my psych meds almost out I was out of anxiety and lithium for three days before I found my refills that got tossed around. And within those three days I was angry, combative, easy to start an argument, my dad even said that he had to remind himself that I was off meds and not pick a fight or yell at me. And I'm my mom's caregiver and I was a little snappy to her. Didn't mean to be, but I was. \n\nSo I had to call and cancel my appointment for yesterday to see my doctor. Turns out they had left the practice. Didn't say a word to any of her patience. When I last saw her she said \"I'll see you seen, and remember to take your medicine.\" Now I'm having to find a new provider and fast. Only problem is there's hardly any in my area that takes my insurance. If they do they're in the bigger city and offering video appointments, which is perfect. But I'm not finding any. \n\nPlus my symptoms have really been active here lately. I've been seeing things a lot more, paranoid, and one that hasn't happened since starting medicine is faces being disordered. Like I'm seeing things none stop. And I'm feeling things too. But I can't go to the hospital, I have to take care of my mom.",

In our second year together we were homeless living in a forest but close to a couple shops. I waited in our tent whilst he went to the shops with a little bit of money we had and had been drinking non stop for a week.\n\nHe came back to the tent running and told me he just killed a man. He told me the man had weed and my boyfriend wanted to buy some and the man told him to suck him off for it so my boyfriend flipped and punched him to the ground and stomped on his head/back of neck and fled the scene to get back to me. This is after he managed to get booze from the shop. He told me what had happened and that he heard the man's neck break and eyes went white after him punching him. He claims he killed him.\n\nI said yeah right as not to believe him but I'm not sure if he really did this or just says it to see if I dob him in to the police. I haven't mainly because I don't know if to believe him or not. He has told me numerous times he says certain things for effect to gets a reaction from people or to shock them. Deep down I hope that he is just chatting bs but I keep thinking about it especially as every now and again when my boyfriend is drunk he will talk about it and has no remorse for what he has done (if he did).\n\nI have told him I don't really believe him. Maybe I'm in denial? What would happen to me if he has done it and police find out? I don't want to go to prison for something he did by himself.\n\nI mentioned my boyfriend has paranoid schizophrenia (and refuses treatment) and I know from my own research they can lie about things or exaggerate about things or have delusional thoughts on things that didn't happen. Do you think it is true and if so what to do about it?\n\nWe aren't homeless anymore thankfully and yes I know boozing isn't a great look for homeless people which I never did when we were in that way only him but I don't blame him as was stressful.",

At least that's what iv'e been told I may or may not be going through or may or may not have, I did experience multiple psychotic episodes I seen all the hallucinations and illusions delt with the delusions. \"thought brodcasting\" if that's what you even wanna call it never made sense to me, for about a year now I been tortured by the feeling of others feeling, hearing, seeing my thoughts. I tried to cover it up with mental health issues and \"it's just the drugs\" but day after day month after month it just kept getting more real to me, from people secertly asnwering me when I do speak in my head, there body langauge, how I can just feel the energy in the room. No one ever says anything to me when I do say or think things in my head they all just seem to ignore it and move on with their lives but I know personally deep down that they can hear/read/see my thoughts. I don't know how or why? I'm a nobody you know, just a 22 year old boy who got his heart broken and fell into the wrong crowd, Lost family and friends over this lost my life because of this.. before my thoughts were nothing just a day to night normal thoughts like any other person, but once you experience something so terryfying so abnormal out of this world even, you tend to not think so normal.. and that's what happend to my head it turned sick/hatful/strange, once i found out people could actually hear my thoughts you know with me experimenting with this gift or curse my thoughts turned against me they turned evil. I just wanna be normal again... an example of how i know this is real and i have one to many reasons why or how i found out this is real, I came home after a night out I was drinking and you know \"using\" only seems to happen when im under the influence but latley that hasn't been the case it's becoming real, sober for 1-2 weeks now and my thoughts are still being \"brodcasted\" fucking stupid... any off topic, I came home and was laying on the couch going through another one of my \"episodes\" hearing voices not inside my head but outside my head almost like if there outside my house or in the walls, as i'm talking to these voices by the way i know these voices like i know them in person. We start talking about all sort of things but one thing that stood out to me and you'll see why is my hair, the voices mentioned my hair on how it looked before \"blond\" and keep in mind all these conversations i was having were all in my head not a single word said for the next 2 days. Earlier that night after these conversations i over heard one of my family members talking and as i got close they were talking about me and i can't make out what they were talking about but i did know they were talking about one of the conversations i was having with the \"voices\" and what freaked me out is that they mentioned the \"blond\" hair.. I don't know if any of this makes sense or if i'm actually mentally insane. I'm not looking for help or maybe i'm to stupid enough to not get help, if anyone knows or is experincing this feel free to share.",

        "Text": "Id love to get some new input, me & my family can feel so misinformed on how to deal with it. My older brother fell into psychosis about 7 years ago & it’s been a rollercoaster. In rare times the him I grew up with shines through & I really cherish it, but a lot of the times his presence is torment. I mean It was harder in the beginning when we had no idea what the deal was but now we have more ways of going about it like medication or keeping him involved w/ the rest of us. \n\nI will say that Ive felt that Ive finally figured how to be more accepting & humanizing towards him even if I cant understand his world, I laugh with him at the random shit he thinks of or if he’s being too disruptive I can tell him to chill out without blowing up at him, but its hard to get my parents on that same level and I really cant blame them at all they already have so much on their plate. \n\nThe recent struggle is getting him to take his meds, he’s being dishonest & we can clearly tell he’s not taking them, and since my parents dont deal with him how I do they keep trying to reason with the un-sane man and blow up at him when he doesn’t talk any sense. Its been going for 7 years & for some reason they still cant acknowledge he cant be reasoned with when he’s in this state. When he’s on the meds he’s mostly an emotionless zombie who’s always deeply deeply depressed & gives my parents attitude for it, almost like hes stuck in his angsty teenage phase. When he’s off the meds you can probably guess it, he’s unstable talks to himself nonstop and eventually builds himself up to a mental breakdown the neighbors can hear full of everything from threats to falsely accusing my parents of everything & so much more. In those moments he gets admitted, it’s happened more times than I can remember. He has no relationship with the other younger 5 people in this house, they basically fear him, its never sat right with me to see the kids have to grow up around this. \n\nDespite everything we still love him to death & its the only reason my parents havent gaven up yet, but lately I worry my parents are at their limit with him. If Im going to the wrong group for this Id appreciate being directed to the right one, I kinda lost what the point of making this post was while typing it but ig Id like some advice, or maybe for the short term the best idea yall got to get him to actually take his meds",

I almost walked into a construction place and probably almost got a brick dropped on my head from the roof. But some guy stopped me. I thanked him and said I was sorry. But that didn't stop me from walking on the road as if wanting to get run over. I didn't want to, but I felt like I wouldn't mind it either. Unless it hurt like hell. I wanted to call a mental ambulance on myself but my mom took my phone for a while. I just want to finally find out what's wrong with me. I feel so empty. Hopeless. Worthless. It sounds corny but I feel depressed. Instead of getting yelled at every day by my mother who knows nothing about mental illness and thinks she can yell the normalness in me.

I used to be so paranoid as a child about EVERYTHING to the point that I couldn’t really confine in anyone because I thought they’d use it against me and punish me.\n\nI ended up in a psych ward for SH and overdose on pain meds (I can elaborate if you ask). After a bit in the ward I started hearing voices blaming me for something. They said ‘you did this’ and I immediately stepped out to see the big television say something about how the pain meds are being low nation wide or something like that. I told the staff and they gave me olanzapine and I haven’t heard voices or felt severely paranoid since. How?\n\nMy father, an EMT, thinks I have a form of schizophrenia due to my signs and because my family has a history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (which I’m diagnosed with along with post traumatic stress due to sexual abuse, emotional abuse, so on). How did olanzapine stop it so quickly?",

In fact, I recently mentioned my diagnosis to my mum, and she said, \"Paranoid?? Really? I don't think so!\" and I said, \"Well, that's the diagnosis, mum!\" \n\nBut I think I know what she means, in a way. \"Paranoid\" or \"paranoia\" doesn't really come into my psychological  landscape for the most part. \n\n*Having said that* (!!), this evening I realised that paranoia, for me, manifests itself in this kind of \"hyper self-awareness\" that becomes sporadically apparent to me during random moments of stress. All of a sudden (and usually when I've taken a *whole* pill, not to press the point!) I get this feeling like overthinking in the extreme, in which nothing I do seems to be satisfactory, or at least satisfactorily relaxing. It's only stress, but I realised, in that state, I'm super self-conscious of everything I do. \n\nAt one point this evening, mid-stress, I realised... that self-consciousness *is* paranoia!! \n\nIn this state, even if I'm alone in my apartment, I feel like even the cats are judging me! \n\nBut I worked out a solution: Whereas during these times my mind and energy is all over the place, the strange truth is that all I need to do is *focus on some object.* It might be a book or a pillow - anything. Then, I found, that relaxes me, and I can concentrate my mind and energy, and the offensive stress simply ebbs away. \n\n(Incidentally, I want to say that I only noticed this after having had the thought: \"Okay! I'll do *exactly* what God wants me to do!\" He seemed to enjoy that!) \n\nAre you paranoid schizophrenic? How does paranoia manifest itself for you? What ways do you find help you to cope? \n\nThanks for reading!   \n",

I dont want my entire life to be like this and I dont want to go back to a hospital let alone being sent to juvie. I could really use some support right now, im confused on what I should do..",

I start thinking people are talking about me, even have heard them talking about me, and I start not being able to feel my hands. \n\nI don't know why but it feels the thoughts are coming from a woman. Then I start having internal arguments with her. I go on rants and it can be really annoying because she sometimes speaks through me in the form of really negative self talk. Then it turns into outloud arguments where it's the both of us. She's speaking through me and I'm speaking to what I'm saying as her. She's mean af. \n\nI've started writing positive affirmations. I thought it would get better when a man appeared. No. He's even worse. He encourages parts of me that shouldn't be. He wants to be me and causes anger. I see him in my dreams. Sometimes the both of them talk to me at once. He never speaks through me. He just shows me how he's controlling my thoughts. She's the mean one, he pretends to be the nice one. However when I try to talk about them lightheaded and it's like they're punishing me for mentioning them. So I just don't mention them out loud. I mention other things but this is just a long story to tell and it's really difficult.  They've also said not to tell people about them. Plus I thought one of them was a guardian angel and then the devil. Also would I get in trouble? ",

I am afraid that I've lost all my privacy and I'll never get it back. It puts me in a suicidal place sometimes because I fear I'm harming people with my thoughts, and it makes me think the world would be objectively better without me. Do others of you deal with this?

        "Text": "TO THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEIR LIVES, PLEASE READ!!!! I LITERALLY RECOVERED FROM THIS A FEW YEARS AGO AFTER A 6 YEAR HIATUS. I TRIED TO MAKE IT SHORT BUT MADE AN EFFORT TO RELATE AND HELP OTHERS DEALING WITH THIS.... ITS WORTH IT.\n\nA couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia while I was in college. I met a weird ass girl who claimed she was psychic. She literally looked like something out of movie because she was short and had serious issues with her lower body causing her to have to use a cane when she walked... Anyways I just moved in and met a lot of new people. she hung out with our group because she lived on the same floor. The first day most of our floor hung out in a guys room(probably 10 of us) and started drinking. We're all just hanging out. I happened to be sitting next to her and all of a sudden she randomly starts talking about weird shit like she can guess what color hair my mom had and claimed she was psychic but when she got a question wrong she would talk her way out of it. Everyone in the room except her were completely silent the entire time she was yapping her brains out.........lol? the only reason I was nice to her was because I just met everyone and I didn't want to come off as an asshole........ so I befriended her...... Man, was I in for one HELL of a surprise 🤦\n\nFast forward a couple weeks go by and she keeps approaching me in the cafe and kept talking about supernatural visions she was having and insisting that I make an effort to develop the skill that she apparently had.. now I wasn't the type of person to attempt to think that stuff through.. Id normally be like oh hell nah your crazyyyyy AF!!!??!? I'm not gonna take a step in that direction(more to follow on why I believe God told Adam and Eve to not eat from the tree of \"knowledge\"). But I couldn't help but think about what that girl was talking about. I started believing that I could predict Powerball numbers and cheat on tests etc.(none of that actually came to fruition)\n\nFast forward a year and now I'm thinking I can read what's going on around me. I'm thinking that I'm starting to develop the skill and sooner or later........... I'll be a FREAKIN GENIUS....................\nThen it hit me like a brick wall(and I mean that in every sense of the term)......... I was sitting in class and all of a sudden I swore my professor was talking about me. He kept looking at me and it was like he was talking to me indirectly and too the rest of the class. Almost like he was trying to expose me in some way. Now everyone who spoke sounded like they were frustrated with why I was getting all the attention....... This continued for both junior and senior year and everywhere I went. It was like everyone knew everything about me and constantly made an effort to expose me. It was so real that my friends and family did not sound that way but seemed like they were trying to signal to me that \"oh I already know this.. you just woke up huh??\"........ Literally like a switch turned on an everyone was woke.\n\nIt was ABSOLUTELY the most TERRIFYING experience I've ever had. Me being the purpose driven, reasonably responsible person, I almost had to freakin drop out of school to seek medical help but I refused because I got sooooooo mentality ill to the point that I thought the doctor would think ....oh he just \"woke up\" he's not fully developed yet.....Crazy right???????.... I can't even get myself to go seek help. Like a parasite was controlling my brain....\n\nNow, I managed to pass all my classes and graduate but remained unemployed because I kept telling the employer during interviews about my condition... Obviously you should never bring that type of thing up in an interview if you expect to be an ideal candidate or they will think you're crazy and unstable..... So while I was unemployed I started drinking because my dad who lived at home at the time would always drink. I never had a problem with it in the past so he would offer me liquor everyday thinking I was soon going to land a job... Years have gone by an now I'm a full blown alcoholic.......I became completely antisocial. Stopped going out and continued to refuse medical help. My parents called the police and they showed up to my house probably 3-4 different times to send me to the hospital, where I would continue to deny that I was mentally ill...\n\nA few more years go by and my mom ends up getting admitted to the hospital for kidney stones and blood infection. My family was so distraught that my sister called the police on me AGAIN and they showed up for a warrant that was issued to me and brought me to the court house for a trial on my alcohol abuse case........... Fast forward,,,now I'm in rehab..............1 month goes by and am around some hardcore drug addicts... Fuckin' screaming in the hallway in the middle of the night. Arguing over cigarettes..fights, you name it. Exactly what you would expect rehab to be like. 2 months in, I keep to my self, minding my own business and now I'm starting to think the other drug addicts around me are plotting to fight me. They would pick on me for being so quiet. So........., I FINALLYYYYYY give in.... I request to speak to a doctor in the hopes that they would send me home(which they did not lol). I finally tell the doctor everything............ He said that I had some how developed a form of schizophrenia and he prescribed me the psych medication RESPIRADONE... I would see him weekly and I kept telling him that my condition is persistent(which it was)and he kept upping the dosage(probably 2-3 more times)........ THAT STUFF HAD TO HAVE SAVED MY LIFE!!!!\n\nFast forward.... It's my last day and I'm waiting on my ride home not thinking anything of it... My ride finally arrives and it's a 2 hour drive home.................it wasnt until I got home that I realized that I had FULLY cured from my full blown schizophrenic experience. I did not for one second on the ride home think the driver was reading my mind or tauting me in some way. We did have some short convs but it was like talking to God. First time in years I spoke to someone where they sounded like they had no idea what was going on in my head......That last month at rehab, now that I think about it, was actually way better than I had thought. I literally stopped thinking that people were watching me and I truly believe the medication along with forcing my self into social environments helped with my full recovery.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention was that while I was in that mess I was reading the Bible and learning about God and the devil. Everyone knows the story of Adam and Eve and how God said to them, you can eat whatever you want but DO NOT eat from THAT tree(the tree of knowledge). Apparently people who are psychic actually worship Satan and are leveraging the idea that they can attain this ancient knowledge for their own benefits... God mentioned in the Bible that this knowledge is not for humans and that it will only bring you misery because he did not design the world and humans to function in that spiritual domain....Satan thought otherwise.......Just something to think about...as the old saying goes, \"Curiosity killed the cat\".\n\nNever attempt to enter territory which you are not familiar without approval from God and proper guidance. It's common sense to understand that in the physical world, there are places which most people do not belong. People go to third world, run down countries where they are cutting people's heads off and sending them to family members for fun(Hell). It's literally the same idea. As your sickness begins to progress with this type of illness that was sparked from complete ignorance, it means you are spiritually ascending into the fiery pits of Hell, symbolically. And this was in the making. It was a MISTAKE(do it once, it's a mistake. Do it again, and it's stupidity) which you would have avoided if you initially had chosen to follow God. There is a reason why our 1st century ancestors looked to God as a guide through life and I suggest people who are pushing him away to think again......... When this type of thing happens to you I bet the first place you will go is the exact opposite of where you would expect. Either Isolation(mental jail), actually physical jail, hospital, or graveyard. MAN!!! I ended up in isolation and in a actually jail cell a few times waiting for my court appearance for drug abuse!!!!\n\nStop thinking that ghost and stuff like that exist in the physical world. Never in my 30 years of life have I seen a ghost. I went into an abandoned haunted children's hospital for the mentally ill growing up and used to ride by it on my bike all the time. People would paint the pentagram with candles all over the entrance to attempt to summon ghosts...Apparently, where that hospital use to be, the woods were considered haunted because of the burial grounds where they buried mentally ill children. They have an actual cemetery but if you walk along hidden paths you will see stones with numbers marked for where they buried the excess of children before they closed down the hospital...And there is also a story of a girl from the hospital being lured into the woods and killed!!!!For all my years riding through there I never saw shit!!!!!! As a kid, I even rode through there at 2AM on my dirt bike and did not for a second think I was gonna see a ghost lol.\n\nAlthough I am fully cured I will always remember this and I suggest people who are dealing with schizophrenia to seek medical help ASAP because I was cured after YEARS of this....As a result, I had gained 100lbs, started smoking cigarettes and am still dealing with alcoholism. Even after all that, I now to this day feel absolutely amazing. I'm free of the firm grasp the devil had on me. I swam back to shore. I honestly believe that rehab saved me from potential suicide. Trust in God and follow his words. God made you. He has an explanation and a cure for literally every illness you can imagine. Never feel alone. Don't associate yourself with people whose behavior is completely out of the norm of what is morally acceptable in modern day society. I sure as hell will never make that mistake again........ENDURE LIFE!!!!!!! There are no short cuts. Hard work will build character and character is what will help to prevent you from being mentally tortured, manipulated, and lured into darkness.\n\nFYI, I had been unemployed for close to 5 YEARS while going through this absolute mess of an experience. I was a hard worker through my teen years and college so my family held me down. I graduated when I was 23 and landed my first job at 28!!!!!!!!!!!!Blew my fuckin 20s away over STUPID thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT BE A FUCKING WEIRDO!!! Fumbled many girls in college because of it!! So what your an engineer... You don't have to be a loser!!!! .........\n\nAlso.... As a science guy, you know that you can have ideas/theories about physical concepts, but if it can't be proven through math and follow fundamental laws, its merely an illusion.\n\nAnyways........Few months and a couple of interviews later(I DID NOT mention anything about my experience prior to applying) I ended up landing an amazing job at an amazing company 😄😎. Happiest I've been in a while to say the least.",

Anyways these neighbors live across from us a couple houses to the right. They have done like 50-60 things in the last year or so but I will write the most serious thing they have done is one night in beginning of May I was coming home and I was on their side of the street when I see a male approach from the other side and I don't look at him so he stops in the middle of the sidewalk and turns around. Then he keeps walking towards me with his fists going up and down furiously and staring at me. I made the mistake of not crossing the street so I could avoid him and he passes by me really closely. Then I wait on the side of the street so cars can pass by so I can cross to my side of the street when I see another male approach me from behind then stops like 40-80 feet away from me I look at him and he stops. Then I cross the street and get inside the house. This was a huge mistake cuz since then they have been relentless and won't stop.\n\nLike a few nights ago when I came home two of them followed me by bikes and I cursed at one of them on the bike as he was getting off the bike and didn't look at me and then I gave them the finger as others of them were most likely watching from their window and got inside the house. Mind you this following me on the bikes thing and waiting around for me is weird and creepy because they can see when I leave the house and then wait 1-2-3-4 hours for me to get back home and do these things like follow me by bikes or stand in front of the next door neighbor's house and what not. Then 2-3 nights ago I come home and I saw a male at least 5-10' to 6 feet tall standing in front of our next door neighbor's house around 2 am and as I turn around the corner he doesn't look up from his cell phone and keeps getting kinda restless as I pass by him and I mutter a curse word. Then I turn around and curse at him once and he looks at me and crosses the street. I then close the gate and get inside the house. Then this morning I'm asleep around 10 am when I hear machine noises.. it is getting kinda annoying and as I notice it and wake up the machine noise goes quiet and it has been quiet ever since now after an hour or so.\n\nThis machine thing has been happening since summer. It is kinda a drill thing or something where they turn it on and as soon as I wake up or get annoyed by it then it goes quiet. \n\nSo yeah.. this machine thing kinda freaks me out. But they are exploiting my weaknesses and it is 10-20-30-40 of them and just me. So it is kinda hard to deal with them only me and I live with my younger brother and no one including the police believe me and I haven't told my treatment team cuz they might not believe me or may increase my medication dose or frequency or something. So yeah it sucks.",

But I was diagnosed at 14, initially in a psych ward and later confirmed by my psychiatrist. I'm just curious why some professionals wait to diagnose it, while others don’t.\n\nHas anyone else been diagnosed with schizophrenia at a young age, or been told it couldn’t be diagnosed until you were older? I'm wondering about the reasoning behind this and why the approach seems to vary.",

        "Text": "Hey everybody, the asshole mod here. As I'm sure everyone is aware, Donald Trump has won the presidential election and will be the 47th president of the United States. We have had a moratorium on political discussion until after the election was over, which is obviously now lifted.\n\nWe have tried our best to make sure this community stayed insulated from the nonsense, and I don't regret our decision to do that. It's not like it would have mattered.\n\nI'm here to talk about what this might mean for us- all of us, without exception. Inside or outside of the US, male/female/NB, religious or atheist, white/non-white, cishet/LGBTQ- there will be consequences for *everyone*.\n\nThings like civil rights, abortion, the future of democracy and elections in the US... those are domestic issues. We can talk about that, sure, but some people don't have much invested in that, especially Redditors outside of the US. This subreddit is a global community. There is something we are *all* invested in though, and depend upon to survive...\n\n***The economy.***\n\nIf Donald Trump succeeds in implementing his economic policy, there will be a recession in the United States-literally every expert on economics who has made their opinion known on that agrees. It is a guarantee. It may even be so bad that it turns into an actual depression. I cannot overstate how disastrous this economic policy is, makes Reaganomics look like sunshine and roses by comparison.\n\nGiven how intertwined the global economy is, that is going to affect *everyone* worldwide. It will create instability. There is nowhere you can go to escape from that. If you were thinking of leaving the US- it won't matter. There is no escaping that. For countries that are already unstable- this is likely to lead to domestic strife and unrest. Riots, possibly even civil wars depending upon how unstable your country gets.\n\nInstability is bad in general, but *very* bad for us. Many of us rely on government benefits to make ends meet. The economic crunch that is guaranteed to follow may place some of us at risk of losing those benefits, or having them reduced. We will feel the pain.\n\nAs hard times come around, people often look for a scapegoat. Guess who the black sheep is in the Western world? Us. Take it from me- don't bother trying to cozy up to people who think you're subhuman for existing, because they'll dispose of you like trash once you cease being useful... so at least act like you have some self-respect, and don't debase yourself to cater to the hypothetical oppressors. We've seen that time and time again, and the only thing you get in the end is humiliation to show for it.\n\nI'm not here to point fingers, and I'm not interested in personal attacks. Those who supported Trump will find out what a mistake it was to do that. It is a guarantee that you will be negatively affected by your decision. So... keep that in mind in the years to come. These are the consequences of your own decisions- make peace with that now. You also might want to keep that to yourself here moving forward. People tend to perceive those who sell out their own kind pretty negatively.\n\nSo, why am I talking about this?\n\nI'm bringing this up because it is more important now than ever that we *stand together,* that we maintain our community. If you do not have a community that you engage with regularly, we may suggest our Official Discord *or* one that we have listed in our monthly Megathreads- linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/search/?q=Discord+Megathread) for your convenience. Our most recent one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1ghh4lo/discord_chat_group_invite_megathread/) if you would like to advertise your group.\n\nIf you don't have reliable social support offline, then get it online. Stay connected, don't self-isolate. We might get some heat, but I don't have any intention whatsoever of being an 'easy target', and am going to make it clear that we're more trouble than we're worth to hassle- but we can only do that if we are united.\n\nThis is the biggest community- or resource of any variety- for people with schizophrenia anywhere in the world, bar none. This is as good as it gets. There is safety in numbers here, and anonymity as well... as we're all aware, I'm sure.\n\nAs for everything else... the possibility of RFK Jr. getting his hands on the healthcare system (including mental health), geopolitics, reproductive rights, education, democracy... have at it, this thread is a freebie. The only thing we ask is to remember that Rule 1 is still in effect (no personal attacks). I have been disappointed by seeing people at each other's throats more often recently, and we're going to be cracking down on that. We're not \"warning\" anyone anymore about Rule 1.\n\n**Wishing death on Trump is an immediate ban**, as the subreddit could be shut down for us failing to do so. However, wishing JD Vance will be the 48th president on the United States sooner rather than later is *not* a violation of Reddit's Content Policy. I'm under the impression that Mr. Vance would not be so stupid as to implement the economic policies in question, that but remains to be seen.\n\nAs many people have found out the hard way, all we can really count on at the end of the day is each other- that's coming from someone who has been at this for 19 years now. I politely ask that you keep that in mind as you interact with others on this subreddit- because I really don't want to be giving people the boot if I don't have to.\n\nI have no idea what will happen in the years to come- much less in every country around the globe. What I do know is that hard times are coming for all of us. There have already been a few posts and comments expressing suicidal ideation and great fear over the future. I understand the great stress this places so many people under- but I want to reiterate something I've said before. In case it's not obvious from the fact that I've had schizophrenia for 19 years, I'm quite familiar with suicidal ideation myself. There is only one \"secret\" I have to share over it. There is a speech I always found very motivating, ironically from a film about a dude with psychosis:\n\n>I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n>We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: \"Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone!\n\n>Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD!\n\n*- Network (1976)*\n\nAlmost 50 years later... funny how spot-on that speech still is. Damn near prophetic.\n\nEven if every breath you take is purely out of spite for those who would like more than to see you gone, then keep that fire going. Use anger to fuel your inner fire. When you feel like you just can't it anymore, like it's too much to bear, you can't keep going- I want you to remember this, I want you to dig down as deep as you can... and I want you to GET MAD. No matter what happens, we're going through it together- as a community, and as a people who share the bond of the common struggle. If someone comes to hurt us, then we will make sure they regret it... one way or another. This is my home- and like I've said before, *nobody fucks with my home,* and *nobody fucks with my people.*\n\nWe have a lot to discuss, so stay tuned for updates in the coming days.\n\nSo... yeah. Get mad, but also please be polite in the comments! :)\n\nPS: Pay no mind to upvotes/downvotes in the comments. I assume some chuds are gonna be here soon thanks to bots that flag any mention of Trump's name.",

I was going to church at the time and had been going since i was 8 however i was just super fascinated with evil. At 13 i was hospitalized for my first time and several times after that and they said i had severe psychosis which is what they say for minors(at 18 i was diagnosed). At 14 i was living with my uncle and dad. I spoke to the devil one night. I sat on the floor in my bathroom looking into a mirror and kept repeating Lucifer i have an offer to make you if my sacrifice is enough until i heard him, he spoke to me and asked what was my offer, i told him he can have my soul if he brings me happiness, he laughed and my eyes turned red, he said we have a deal and he left. One day my uncle said we need to get an exorcism done on me at the church because it will take away my voices and visions. I agree. We go to the church and the pastor has me stand in front and a circle of people surround me , they all put their hands on me and begin praying, some begin to speak in tongue, the pastor speaks and says a long prayer over how the devil will release me and he is no match to Gods mighty power , i had started shaking and the pastor took holy water and put it on my head while preaching , the holy water burned my head and (i was told by my uncle and others there) i began to speak in a demonic voice saying that she’s not going anywhere and the water continued to burn me, i never fell back or dropped down so the pastor said it failed. I believe the devil did take me that night. And he kept his promise by bringing me happiness but he twisted it and made sure that i would experience great happiness followed by unimaginable pain. He gave me what i wanted while making me regret it. He gave me happiness but not at any cost i wanted. I’ve got very close to God and asked him for forgiveness and to love me. He does love me. He speaks to me and i’ve seen him. However he hasn’t took away the hallucinations so i now believe i have both of them in me and i am the embodiment of Good and Evil ",

Needless to say he’s been through a lot on top of learning about he’s schizophrenia diagnosis. \n\nHe’s liver and pancreas also took a hit and is now on all sort of medications on top of he’s meds to control the schizophrenia symptoms. He has recently been put on daily insulin do to he’s new schizophrenia medications spiking his sugar levels. He got he’s meds changed because his previous medication had him sleeping all day and gave him anxiety which in turned had him eating all day and all night. He eats all day everyday on some days and on other days refuses to eat certain foods or to eat at all.\n\n It’s like a catch 22, the meds that help him control his schizophrenia symptoms cause his diabetes symptoms to flare up but if he goes of he’s meds other problems arise. He doesn’t advocate for himself when it comes to speaking with doctors about he’s side effects and acts like he couldn’t care less what happens with his health. My poor mom is the one having to be behind him giving he’s med, checking he’s sugar levels, making sure he eats right all while monitoring he’s mental health. \n\nAlthough he currently holds a part time job which I know is a good sign, we feel like he’s giving up on taking care of himself and has no motivation to help his situation. I live out of state and have no idea how I can help him besides calling and checking up on him. I’ve researched a lot and listen to a podcast on schizophrenia to try to understand what he is going through but I’m definitely at lost on how to help. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",

I believe high tech secret military technology is being used to insert thoughts into my brain that arent mine. I believe this is being done to millions of people, many without their knowledge.   \n  \nI believe a supercomputer is involved and it manipulates people against each other to hurt each other. I believe it is extremely good at manipulating people and it can make people act inexplicably to hurt one another. I believe it does this through blackmail. I believe it can hack almost anything. I believe it can generate voices similar to those of people I know when I talk to them on the phone, and it can replace people when talking to them online.   \n  \nMy devices actually have been hacked and this supports my beliefs.

After an hour, my mother had to leave work to pick me up. It should be noted that during this entire time I was under the effects of the hallucination, so I kept myself in check and tried not to insult anyone. Now I have to go back to my medications, which makes my mother very sad because we both thought that it would no longer be necessary because I no longer had these types of hallucinations, but the truth is that I don't give a damn, I don't mind taking them as long as they don't make me fat.",

I used to be on seroquel and zoloft, but I stopped zoloft this summer with my psychiatrist, and it was going perfectly fine. But I started school again, I've been a bit stressed.

And a few minutes ago, I heard ringing from my mattress (The type of ringing your phone make when you try to call someone and you're waiting for them to pick up.) I heard three very distinct beep. \nI live alone so I have no one to fact check. It might be my neighbor calling someone in his apartment but the walls are thick, I can barely hear him, why would I hear his phone through my mattress?\nThis is rambley, I'm sorry.

The stress of staying up for days at a time would frequently put my mind in a very delusional place. I would have a sudden impending sense of doom fearing multiple creatures would rush into my home whenever I slept for example. Over time I began to think that all these issues were intentional and some sort of message to me that I shouldn’t sleep. I started to believe that there was a higher plane of existence being revealed to me through delusions and hallucinations. I convinced myself that by sleeping I was resetting a sort of cooldown (lack of better term) within myself which stopped me seeing the “true” nature of reality. This caused me to intentionally begin staying up for nights on end and when I would finally decide to sleep it was very difficult as I would hear voices urging me to stay awake or I would suddenly experience sleep paralysis. Has anyone else every felt that they were meant to stay awake, or that the issues associated with sleep deprivation were actually some sort of higher existence?",

For her, the CTO has been absolutely essential—not just as a structured plan for managing her schizophrenia, but as a lifeline that supports her well-being, her job, and her role as a parent. She deeply values the stability it has given her, and losing it feels like a major step backward.\n\nWe’re looking for guidance in two areas:\n\n\t1.\tFinding Legal Representation: We’re seeking an attorney in Alberta experienced in mental health law and the CTO appeal process. If you know of lawyers, legal aid, or advocacy groups in Alberta who specialize in these cases, your recommendations would mean the world to us. We want to ensure she has the best possible support in fighting for this.\n\t2.\tStrengthening Our Appeal: If anyone here has been through a CTO appeal or knows what’s needed to make a compelling case, any insights would be appreciated. We’re especially interested in any documentation, personal testimonials, or relapse prevention strategies that might reinforce the appeal.\n\nWe’re committed to helping her maintain the stability and support she feels she truly needs. Any advice or resources would be incredibly helpful as we navigate this challenging process. Thank you all in advance.",

My psychotic break & thought broadcasting delusions plus mental deterioration from psychosis have left me zombified when it comes to real life interaction & I have isolated to the extreme. My social anxiety was bad before but is now debilitating because I dont remember how to interact with people irl & every interaction is painful. I either interrupt by responding too quickly or if asked a question, too slowly & stupidly (no focus, forgetting basic words & phrases, extreme memory lapses & extensive memory recall issues).\n\nI can barely focus on reading (avid reader before) & I am so sensitive to external stimuli, particularly sounds (my PTSD makes me jumpy) & smells. I used to love music but it now makes me super emotional & I start crying at songs I used to enjoy. That & I feel like I need to listen to new music because I had certain songs & artists play a central role in psychosis. The only thing I enjoy anymore is food (talk about being in survival mode) but it's such a brief satisfaction compared to the length of every day. I just want to sit inside & eat. I don't know what to focus on & when I do try to focus, I struggle & get frustrated & move onto the next thing.\n\nI don't want to leave my bed- if I do, I don't want to leave the house. I just realized thought broadcasting isn't real a couple weeks ago. I am still getting stabilized on my meds, which I am able to get through government assistance. I will also be able to go back to school with government help next semester & [ideally/hopefully with my schizophrenic diagnosis] get on disability- which isn't enough but I cannot work. I am actually severely disabled mentally & it's affecting my physical health as well. \n\nHowever, I spent & lost all my money during my psychosis. I still dont remember how exactly or where it went but I am assuming lots towards drugs. Not taking my mental state & dependence on government assistance seriously I stupidly got a job 2 weeks ago at Amazon as a delivery driver because of my recent money issues. The night before I started my driving job I got into a car accident & totalled my car. Mind you, after psychosis I noticed my driving was off, somehow. Mental issue or maybe perception, idk. Now my anxiety is too high to manage while I'm at work driving (it was already high with social anxiety & constant questioning of my own mind) & my depression has robbed me of motivation to do things on my day off.. my excuse is work is more than enough. It definitely puts me in the energy negatives. I'm upset because I actually had a pretty healthy schedule prior to this job- I was going to IOP & exercising & forcing myself to read & study but now I feel constantly overwhelmed & it's triggered my addictive side- which I've been keeping under control since my hospitalization. I'm going to quit & I feel like a failure for that but my mental health is so poor, plus I need to find a car.\n\nI am living with my family which is supporting me through this time. Luckily for me they can do that because right now I am unable to work. I just feel so badly about my mental state but I am in shambles. I fake it in front of my brother that hates me because of my past as an addict (& he is dealing with a recent bipolar/schizoaffective break- I'm diagnosed schizophrenic) & my father.\n\nIt's a beautiful day out today & I should go for a walk but it will be a good day if I just do my hair & read a little bit & run the couple errands I have to do (signing up for the local pool & exercise hall is 1- I gained lots of weight through hospitalization & isolation this summer). Time is flying by but my mental state keeps deteriorating. I've never been suicidal until this episode & waking up every morning is excrutiating.\n\nI think I need internet community support because in person interaction is too much.",

        "Text": "After my latest period of psychosis someone I was close to abandoned me. She said some hurtful things on the way out tailored to attack my deepest insecurities. Further, she went to my ex who validated her feelings towards me by spreading malicious lies. \n\nI responded to this by cutting contact. I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. I have enough problems.\n\nSpeaking of problems, I lost a few weeks of pay waiting for my short-term disability. I also lost 40% of my income while on short term disability. To compound this, every time I missed an automatic payment the bank charged me NSF fees. Between the missed pay, late fees and NSF fees, I'm a couple months behind on bills. \n\nNow that I'm stable on medication and back to work things are looking better. I'll catch up on my bills, I'll be able to take care of myself properly.\n\nThe big problems I face when I'm unwell is that I can't take care of my hygeine, the cleanliness of my home or my finances. Not to mention the terrifying delusions and disorganized thinking. That doesn't help either. I thought my supervisor was out to get me this time. I sent some emails that I had to go through some difficult conversations and more emails to sort that out. The sunny side of it all is at least my illness is out in the open now and the senior staff are being quite supportive. \n\nI'm pretty lonely right now which is why I'm sharing this. Only a small handful of my friends have stuck by me through all of this, I'm talking I can count the number on one hand. But being in my mid thirties and they as well, we're all busy and barely have time for each other anymore. \n\nI live on my own, I'm high functioning on medication(and completely lost without it), I have a job and a car. I'm thinking about getting a pet (once my financial troubles are sorted) for the companionship. I don't date. It's just too hard for me to be that intimate and vulnerable with another person. I've been hurt too much in past relationships. I'm not on disability but my union does offer short-term and long-term disability if things should ever get that bad again. My family is supportive... ish. They try their best and love me. Not much more I can ask for really. \n\nYep, that's my life in a nutshell. Pretty dull, I don't get out much. But I'm doing OK. Maybe in time I'll be doing better. But I don't aspire to much. All I really want is stable finances, a pet and to stay sane enough to stay out of the hospital. A yearly camping trip would be nice too. Maybe the occasional fishing trip on the weekend? I don't know, I'm a boring guy. But that's the way I like it. \n\n",

You could correlate something to the condition?\n\nAnd if you know Carl Jung, you could correlate something to your experiences?\n\nI say this since people who have taken DMT report ego death, existential terror, guiding entities speaking to them telepathically, evil entities, feeling that an evil energy is being channeled or transcending understanding and even that is all very crazy and not felt in schizophrenia. One thing in common is that according to what I read from people with schizophrenia is that they said they felt that the hallucinations are very real and even that the brain convinces you that they are not a lie, something similar that happens in dreams, and in psychedelic trips where sometimes you do not feel that absence of verisimilitude.\n\nAnything that can be added is greatly appreciated! I don't know what more exactly to ask but i want to hear about this, anything could be useful to explore.\n\nAnd obviously I know that schizophrenia doesn't go much on this side, and it's not something comparable to dreams or psychedelics, but I'm asking from the side of understanding and investigating these connections.\n\n  \nAnd if you see this as something interesting, then please upvote to expand the discussion",

After taking zyprexa (olanzapine), I didn't have these voices anymore. \n\nHowever, 2 months after being on olanzapine, I have thoughts inside my head telling me I should question about reality and they keep asking me questions about meaningless things (ie: \"Are you sure you locked the door?\"). Then follows a dialogue (- are you sure the locked the door? - yes I am sure, stfu). The dialogue is made of intrusive thoughts, thats not me who initiate the dialogue or reply to the questions. \n\nI am also confused because these intrusive thoughts say \"you\" instead of \"I\" and according to my last intrapsychic auditory hallucinations, the voices talked to me using \"you\". \n\nCould you help me?

The other night I experienced something very strange that felt extremely real. I have always been paranoid about electronics, like my TV having a camera that watches me, my laptop webcam being hacked, etc. But the other night I had a frightening experience that I am not even sure if it happened, I searched up my experience and did some research and was lead to schizophrenia. I looked through symptoms and did tests (not true diagnoses, I am aware) and I have a majority of the traits. I’m just wondering if there’s anything I should know before talking to my doctor, any way to convince her that it’s not just anxiety or depression like they always try to tell me it is. Thank you!

        "Text": "I don't know where to even start. My mother has always had to battle her mental illness but these past years she has been unmedicated for the longest time. I moved from Georgia to Minnesota and she let me stay with her. Little did I know her schizophrenia has completely deteriorated her mind. I noticed she would talk to herself out loud NONSTOP to the point where I couldn't even think my own thoughts. It would be drowned out by her talking. She also wears like 8 to 9 layers of clothing in any type of weather. It doesn't matter if it's 100° she's going to wear layers upon layers including a winter coat. This causes her to sweat like crazy and try to cool down the best way that she can. It was to the point where when I was living in her apartment, it was absolutely frigid when I got home. She would open the windows when it was in the negatives and there was no thermostat so whatever heat they gave you, you had to make it work. She would also flush so much unflushable shit down the toilet like floss, hair, basically anything you're not supposed to put down the toilet. Living with her just put me in a bad mood. She also carries around MASSIVE heavy luggage with her everywhere. It's to the point that I can't even go to a fast food place around the corner and grab a quick bite to eat.\n\nFast foward, now I have my own apartment and a job. We lived together for a few months, then my mom got the \"moving\" bug. I told her absolutely not cause my whole childhood was moving from school to school because of her. It took so much of a toll on me that I hate moving more than the average person. So since she doesn't have a job and lives on disability, she decided to leave when I was at work and left my door unlocked (she did not have a key). I was distraught because we both recently had two close family members pass away and now I'm super lonely in a city where I barely know people. But I was fucking glad she left. I was able to cook! Clean! Actually enjoy being home and being able to not be in a shitty mood when going to work because of my mom. My mom would also pick fights EVERYDAY when I was getting ready to go to work. And that's not to mention that she would put all her luggage in the bathroom and would take hours upon hours while I had to get ready to go to work.\n\nShe left for some months and I slowly became happier and happier cause I could actually enjoy my apartment. Welp, today she was in the apartment lobby asleep with all of her things. My heart sank. She told me absolutely NOTHING about coming back to Minnesota (she moved to a completely different state). I'm not happy at all and I'm so distraught that she's back. I don't have the heart to just keep my mom out of my apartment. I've called the police, mental health services SO many times just to help her get the help she needs. She believes she doesn't even have schizophrenia so she has been unmedicated for about 5 years now. I've called mental health services to see if they can help her, but since she is an adult, there is nothing they can do. At least that's what they tell me. And also my toilet is broken because of her flushing crazy amounts of unflushable stuff down the toilet. Her coming back is affecting my mental health bad. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry this post is all over the place. I can't take living with her anymore and I don't know how else to get her help.",

I'm struggling to find any sort of purpose and my thoughts have been deluded from the true cause of my pain. I've become someone I never thought I would be this weak. This broken. My life has no purpose and I'm poisoning those around me. My life has always been taking and taking and taking while just paying little to no effort to others. Depression is just a word, used by people who are sad for the moment. I'm living just to stay alive for my dad. Im in so much pain because I feel that's wrong and at the same time I'm taking from my dad to keep me here which is harming our relationship, I would rather have a fond memory than be know as a let down at his final breath. My last relationship harmed the one person who was my best friend. My brother. I feel like that's become irreparable and that hurt every time I see him. Like I'm just reaching for something I'll never get back. I miss home too much and lost that from something I should have never been a part of. It kills me every fucking day that I've lost everything. I miss my life. I thought that would change but it never does. And it probably never will. Fuck my life and what it stands for. It seems like my own little family is unattainable and I'm wasting my time. All I want is to be free from this. All I want is just someone who can help but that's selfish thinking, I can't expect others to abandon their own lives and problems to help me. Everyone has issues and everyone is struggling. I just wish things were different. I'm just a liability and I don't want this for me. I don't want this anymore. I just can't end it because I feel that stress would end my dad. And he's all my brother has and the rock to my family. I'm stuck between selfishness and an end to the torture I live with. How do I make any sense of it? How do I make progress? How do I just become normal again. My head never stops. The screaming, the thoughts, the fact someone can't leave the room without me thinking they're dying in the next room. Why am I like this. Why can't I stop this. I'm weak. And I need an end. \n\nI have so much rage, so much anger. I have zero control over my emotions and cry alot more than I'll admit. There's so many people who have touched my life in such a positive way and that continue to make the world so much of a better place. Please for those people don't be sad when I'm gone. Just keep helping people and please intervene before they get this far gone. Nothing will stop this path I'm on and it hurts me so much. I just can't deal with everything I've been through and everything I have seen. My experiences may be mocked because of ignorance or sheer stupidity but I wish anyone who mocks to trade their life with me. Most would crumble. I can only keep my head up so long. \n\nI blame alot of this from the pain in my childhood and adolescent years from women in my life. I was beaten and abused. I used to have to stand on one foot all day for hours on end and if I put my foot down I had to do pushups. When I was in contact with social services the said lines are acceptable so I was forced to write book after book of lines saying the same thing. I will not do \"whatever the fuck a child would do\" again and again and again. I was sent back to the UK to live with the biggest piece of shit I have ever known and I will never share those experiences from the clown I came out of. Abandoning my siblings so they can be abused while I go back to abuse. \n\nDuring my adolescent years I turned to violence and found that the worst people in society became my best friends. They helped me move forward. They were my family. Anything they needed I did. I've stabbed, shot, rammed, burgled, attacked, beaten people until they're dead on the floor with no breath left. The police were tyrants and didn't understand me. I needed intervention. I needed help. Instead at 18 I was forced at gunpoint to show someone where a house was and get them inside. Thats what I was punished for. That's what I stuck my fucking neck out for and that's what got me banished from my home. From threats of death if I didn't stay solid to this piece of shit that forced me to do that. \n\nThe last 10 years have been hell and I don't think I'll ever get over this. My life is ruined and I can't seem to find a new one. I need help. But I don't think it will be enough. My mental health is so bad and I can't trust anyone. I always think something will happen. Someone is going to harm me. Someone is going to take advantage of the person I am and again I'll be forced into violence or eventually be killed myself.\n\nA few weeks ago I almost got my release. I wanted my neck cut so bad. All that stopped it was the fact that my boyo is I.A. that was the only thing that stopped it. I told him that when you kill me know I will be okay. But this will have to be answered to. The common denominator was sharing the hatred of someone else. That's how the world works. Nobody helped me in that situation it was me, that person and god. Peace be with you aswell brother. You're on the right path. \n\nI'm wanting to document my life before I leave. I want to share my wisdom but I need a deeper analysis into who I am and I need it documented. For those who I send this to please help that happen.\n\nIt's Ying and Yan, can be no happiness with pain. No progress without hardship. I fail to see the double-sided coin. It's like a never ending cycle of wrong for a glimpse of happiness. I'm destined and desperate for an end to this soon. I don't want this anymore. I don't know when, but it will happen. My hope is wearing thin. For everyone who has helped me thank you more than I can ever give back. For everyone who wished this for me, I'll see you again. \n\nSincerely",

        "Text": "My older brother who is 44 needs help but refuses to seek it. Long story warning\n\nWhen I was 5th grade my brother who then was probably early 20’s was sent back to South America because he had a mental break down and tried to kill himself and would say off the wall stuff. We thought there he could get the help he needs since my father lived there since my parents were divorced and mental health care here costs an arm and a leg. He went to a clinic and was diagnosed with a paranoid psychosis with schizophrenic episodes. He would go to a clinic but refuse to take the medication as it didn’t make him feel good. For the most part our family has supported him financially in South America Allowing him to live in a home fully paid for where he would have minor responsibilities. He hated living there as he grew up in America. Fast forward to today.  He was finally able to come to America and he is staying with me and my family. I never understood the depth of his mental issue until recently, I often mistakenly viewed him as lazy and resented how things were given to him. Clearly I was wrong and misinformed. Unfortunately I don’t think my family in the past took the time to understand his struggles either and I hope it’s not too late to get him the help he needs. \n\nFor the most part he tries to keep himself busy he likes to workout and be active. He is great around my family and is a loving person. The issues arise with him feeling depressed constantly and the stuff he post on social media. He also seems to have a hard time being scheduled and prioritizing things. On social media he vents a lot and says a lot of off the wall stuff like how the Vatican is after him and our family along with racist stuff and how mark Zuckerberg is after him. We recently tried to confront him in the hopes that maybe we can get him some therapy or see a specialist but when we talked to him he went into detail on how we are wrong and how these things are truly real. He mention that cnn has made fun of my mom using her real name and truly believes the Vatican stuff and the mark zuckerburg stuff. Clearly this isn’t true and I fear that if he continues down this path I don’t know what kind of future he will have. He hasn’t had a psychotic melt down yet but he has had episodes in the past. I honestly don’t even know if writing here may offer some solutions but it breaks my heart how all this time\nHe hasn’t gotten the right help and I’m trying to figure this whole thing out now.\n\nI guess my question is for those with this type of experience how do you get a person who doesn’t want to seek help get help. And is it too late for him to get help, how does life look like\nFor him with these issues. \n\nThanks For any advice ",

        "Text": "Hi all, my family need your advice, we don't know what to do. My sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her mid 20s she is now late 30s. After she was diagnosed she was put on meds. And she was mostly back to herself. \n\nLater she got married and have a 5 year old daughter now. 3 years ago she was doing pretty well managing her illness the psychiatrist agree to let her go off the meds. And slowly over last 3 years her symptoms came back. And her psychiatrist retired and she had stopped going to the psychiatrist. \n\nAnd it put such strained on the relationship with her spouse now they are not together anymore. So currently she very paranoid and won't let her 5 year old daughter attend school. She says she will home school her daughter. But all day she just lets her daughter watch tv. And refused to let her ex see their daughter. \n\nRecently I caught her having conversations with herself. All day she just sits at dinner table tying on a note pad on her phone. I have tried talking to her about seeing psychiatrist again, but she is adamant that she is perfectly fine. And claimed she doesn't need to see psychiatrist, not now or in the future. \n\nShe has shown intentions of leaving the country with her daughter. And currently she her mind is not in a right place she thinks everyone is against her. She won't talk to our mom, our dad or our younger sister.\nWe are worry about what will happen to her daughter being raised by her alone and not going to school. \n\nWhat should we do, we don't want her to just move to another country and we will lose contact with her all together. We live in Ontario Canada. Is there anything we can do to get her to see doctor again? Or somehow get a doctor to come and see her and give her an assessment?\n\nPlease help us. \n\nThank you for your advice in advance!!",

She has no job but has pension and enough money to get her meds.\n\nMy dad has been taking care of her since even before I was born (basically more than 25 years already). She’s relatively functioning well (can feed herself, bathe, basic life activities) but you can clearly see the cognitive impairments with her\n- easily forgets instructions\n- does not have a sense of what personal hygiene is (doesn’t care if the toilet is dirty, or can’t properly wash dishes)\n- can’t do critical thinking (ex. Can’t work out how a TV remote control works apart from turning it on/off)\n\nI’m seeing my dad getting tired of it all since it’s like she’s turning back to a child. My dad is getting old already and his attitude is showing that he’s on edge most of the time. I feel like the situation is negatively affecting his own mental health.\n\nI personally feel the frustrations because I’m living with her and as selfish as it sounds, I don’t think it’s my responsibility as well to take care of her. I normally shield her when my dad gets angry because my dad is pretty old school (ex. Gets angry because she forgets simple instructions given to her) and I know it’s a side effect of the disorder but sometimes, it’s really hard on all of us who’s living with her.\n\nCan’t really afford to have her confined in a facility and we feel like it’s wrong to do it to some extent because she’s functioning normally most of the time. \n\nIdk but is anyone else on the same boat as us? What can you advise for us to do?",

He called me last night and said he was walking around his backyard checking to make sure somebody wasn't trying to break inTo his house in the middle of a tornado warning. I told him to go back inside and assured him everything would be okay.\n\nAll day today he's been texting me that he's really grateful for my help and that he just needs to hear my voice.

I don't know how to place some boundaries while he's in psychosis. I do care about him a lot but these actions are making me increasingly uncomfortable. \n\nHow do I approach this without making him feel worse?

        "Upvotes": 3,
        "Text": "Everywhere I go no one respects me.  I’ve always been a “be the bigger man/person” and it led me to taking crap from everyone and being depressed in my late teens. \n\nI started being more confrontational. \n\nIt helped but one day I lost my mind and UNLEASHED.  Several other factors caused this (bad people around me, bad habits, inability to sleep through the night - I went around a year and a half of not sleeping at all - not by choice, marijuana use - thought it was helping me sleep at first, being betrayed by “family” in a HORRIBLY ABUSIVE way, so on and so forth).\n\nEver since then (it’s been 7 years, mind you) I’ve had less control over my emotions.  I try to work out, do MMA, hit a punching bag, but even then, my aggression becomes so loose that I get the urge to just run around screaming and destroying everything and the only way to fight it is for me to shut down completely.  And then I can’t do ANYTHING - I can’t work, I can’t workout, I can’t even interact with others.  This “shutting down” was a reaction I placed on myself early on in childhood growing up in an abusive family where I wasn’t allowed to react in the face of disrespect and full-on psychosis (parents and so-called “family” have them). \n\nEverywhere I go I get no respect.  People talk to me disrespectfully, walk all over me, vent to me and even if I say ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and just stand there they’ll blame me and often make up bullshit stories that I did something that I didn’t do or said something I damn-near literally couldn’t have POSSIBLY said, as I remained quiet. \n\n“Your vibe attracts your tribe” so I know I’m running into other people who struggle with Schizophrenia or Bipolar but I’m tired of being blamed and disrespected for an incident that NEVER occurred.  I know for a FACT that they didn’t because I can stand completely still and say nothing and still people will have an issue and just make shit up.  This reflects my childhood where the SAME SHIT was happening.  I say NOTHING and some asshole (“family”, school “mate”, ANY person really) makes up an ENTIRELY fake scenario to justify their own bullshit, and I do nothing about it because no one hears me out. \n\nMy aggression and ability to stand and defend myself through it was all I had.  And now I can’t go into it without totally losing my mind and hurting someone or myself in a very bad way. \n\nI don’t want to do that to anyone.  Even the “worst person on the planet” because, at the same time and somewhat paradoxically (but you guys understand) I am a HUGE empath and love people.  I only had to become a bit of a monster to get just a little respect.  It was more controlled before but now I don’t have that, no matter how much medicine I take.  I either have to give all my aggression or none at all and it’s so horrible for my mental health.  I’ll be an uncontrolled monster and do something awful and never be able to break out of it which is horrible and dangerous, but the more I walk away, the more I feel like a little bitch for it, even though I know what I am capable of.  It’s exactly what sent me into major depression at such a young age the first time.  I know what I can do but it can cause such horrible destruction. \n\nEven if I unleash “a little at a time” the feelings of that “monster within” stick to me and can cause me to have endless bad spirits on my mind until I go mad or, again, shut down which, at that state of mind make me more horribly depressed, or just unleash in a powerful fit of raging, screaming, destruction and anger, yet again.

If I react I totally lose my mind but at least then people will know not to disrespect and fuck with me in such horrible and perpetual and aggressive ways.  \n\nYes, they do back off when I “unleash the beast” and finally listen and treat me SOMEWHAT LIKE A HUMAN BEING LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE FROM THE FUCKING GET-GO.  Think the “Surprised Pikachu” Meme or the “WhoaWhoaWhoa Okay Chill, you’re being too aggressive you don’t have to yell” pitiful reaction you normally see in TV shows - it ain’t so comedic in truth. \n\nI can’t even workout anymore because I’m always on the verge of losing the remaining grip I have. \n\nPlease don’t tell me to go to the psych hospital or ER because I’ve already DONE THAT SEVERAL TIMES and it DIDN’T HELP because the nurses and staff disrespect me there too.  \n\nAnd I am regularly taking my EXTREMELY POWERFUL medication that is enough to knock out SEVERAL fucking elephants WHILE THEY are fucking.

Could it be possible people with schizophrenia lack this shared impulse, and lacking that could explain some of the negative symptoms? \n\nThe other explanation I have developed for schizophrenia is that it’s akin to being allergic to modernity- not sure if that’s relatable for anyone else 🫠\n\nAlso, does anybody else experience near constant thoughts of death, suffering and suicide but in a way that isn’t depression? I have been wondering how common these depressive thoughts are among the general population and wanted to also read the room with this community to see if that’s just typical negative symptoms. ",

I'm just really curious about where it's showing up and where it isn't, and how long it will take for all of us to get it. Did you all get yours from a specialty or mail-order pharmacy? If so, which one? What general areas have it in your experience? Any ideas on how to get more information on when it'll be available? My TD happened to get a lot worse in the last couple of weeks so I'm super eager to switch ASAP.\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with a Cobenfy educator (see my comment below). Contact Cobenfy to find the drug rep local to your prescriber's area. It will be easier to get samples that way than it will be to find the starter pack through pharmacies at the moment. ",

My name is Lily, and I am currently in my second year of college pursuing teaching :D\n\nI started experiencing hallucinations from as early as age six, and overtime developed more symptoms. I had my first psychotic break at age 14, and was initially diagnosed with MDD while I was institutionalized. \n\nA few years after stopping treatment and medication, I went back to local mental health providers to address my issues going on at the time. A few months of therapy later, I had received my diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (depressive type).\n\nI'm now midway through my third semester at college, and it's starting to get a little hard. I have just started medication again a couple months ago, and I'm currently on Vraylar 3mg. I'm also seeing my doctor again soon for treatment of my ADHD, and have gotten the approval from my care team to try out stimulants for it.\n\nI'm definitely a bit nervous about it, but I was thinking that maybe surrounding myself around others with this kind of disorder would help me feel better during harder times.\n\nI'm considered high functioning, which makes me incredibly happy! Although I'm a little scared of how much further I can really handle. It would be devastating for me if I could not manage to become a teacher, but I'm trying not to be so pessimistic about it.\n\nI'm very happy to be here, and already feel welcomed. \n\nThank you!",

I'm currently on Abilify and frankly very rarely I hear any voices but the problem is with negative symptoms and delusions. I'm scared that if I will lift the dose of Abilify the delusions may go away but it may make anhedonia worse.\n\nI live in Poland and here mental illnesses are like in 3rd world countries, no help from the government for such people and schizophrenia is a huge stigma and taboo here.\n\nI'm educated (BSc in CS) but let's be honest, job market today is very difficult even for healthy people that are good at dealing with stress.

When I went from 80 to 60 and \\*then\\* to 40mg in February, that (the 60 to 40 jump) is what triggered the beginning of TD for me (after several months of akathisia at 80mg). The TD has noticeably worsened in the last two weeks, so I'm tempted to get off the Latuda ASAP, but I don't want to be hasty and reduce too quickly again and worsen the TD.

To understand it, you must keep an open mind to the possibility of life beyond the flesh, quantum mechanics, metaphysics, spirituality, beliefs (cultural, ethnic, religious) the un, sub, and conscious mind, even philosophy (1).”\n…\n\nWhile the reality of schizophrenia and disorders of its category may be undeniably natural — and not exactly by essence, to your point, because a person’s mind is not only a manifestation of their current brain states, but also a network of many thoughts, emotions, and ideas that have corresponded to many past brain states, thereby creating an effectual “ghost in the machine,” and concerning the perpetual correspondence of the mind to our biology, there ought to be ample consideration as to whether a brain state produces a state of mind or whether a state of mind causes a brain state, the latter suggesting that 1.), brain states are activated by the psyche, as observed when synapses are crossed from dendrite to dendrite in whatever pattern our reasoned or intuitive associations dictate, and 2.), the psyche is, in this way, unconfined by or beyond mere correspondence to just our current brain states — it is also true, while it is indeed true that schizophrenia is natural, that there is a great nuance to the diagnosis of disorders of the mind, as there is as unavoidable context to them a convoluted nature between apparent or perceived mental illness and believed spiritual and existential experiences, inquiry, and discovery. There must be regard for the sanctity of the intellect on these deeply human matters, regardless of what state of disrepair it seems to be in on the surface, and this first regard is necessary for a more unanimous regard at this age in healthcare that is of the care and concern for patients as autonomous, deserving, and valuable individuals. A mind is not to any unique individual disadvantageous. If you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and are reading this or any other answer as someone who feels uncomfortable with their diagnosis on the basis of what is suspiciously a medical shortsightedness, I urge you to see yourself as someone who is of those very regards, regardless of there being a disregard in mental healthcare at this time, and to act on that conviction. Don’t instead resign your concerns, and allow your voice to go unheard. Godspeed!\n",

But i was recently re diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which i guess at the end of the day is just a subset of schizophrenia. \n\nAny who i struggled with denial of my diagnosis for the last 6 or 7 years. When i was first diagnosed i believed it but then i started questioning whether or not i actually had schizophrenia because i went off to study psychology in community college and learned about how my symptoms also mimiced some subsets of ocd. So for many years in my head i wouldnt fully accept i had schizophrenia of any kind and was eventually convinced i just had a severe case of ocd. \n\nIt wasn't until i went to my current psychiatrist and hes worked with me the last 6 months to give me a fair diagnosis. I went to him literally telling him i wasnt convinced im schizophrenic and he gave me the benefit of the doubt and has been working with me on different meds and stuff to see if it was in fact OCD. But he also had me answer some questions recently on paper and when he read back to me the questions and my answers and the way he explained everything he convinced me and gave me the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. \n\nWhich now im perfectly fine with and no longer deny this is what i have. \n\nIm curious to those who also were in denial about their condition for any amount of time why it was you denied the fact you had schizophrenia and for how long did this last before coming to terms with your diagnosis? Its really weird but it wasnt until i was told that you can be schizophrenic with out really experiencing the positive symptoms when you lay more on the side of the negative and cognative symptoms like i do, that i began to see myself and what i had in a different way i never realized before.\n\n  \nI think as far as my own denial it was due a lot in part of having my diagnosis be thrown around by mental health professionals who didnt really seem like they enjoyed their line of work over the years. my psychiatrist now really likes his job and is invested in his paitents, which is a new experience for me. also as i said before college didnt help in the denial department lol.\n\nIm just curious about other people experiences with this.

They didn't know why, so I was told after I was helped by the embassy that I was chained to a chair for 45 hours and tortured mentally and physically.

More hell. Psychologist at the time said he thought she was trying to get me to kill myself by making my life so bad. Over time more flashes, noises, music, hallucionations more frequent.\nBegan hearing voices this year.

For those who wanna know I'm 27M diagnosed with paranoid schizphrenia 2 years ago. Doctors didn't realised my schizophrenia because I was fully functional even on low dose of antipsycotics.  When I didn't took my AP prescribed by the doctor the psycosis came back, worsed. At that time being, I was delusional, thinking that my anti-tero squad in my country wants to acces my email and my bank account. I was so damn delusional, that I changed the email of my Monesse without knowing the damn mail. Fast forward, I was hospitalized 2 months and I was put on on injection so I cannot miss a dose again. After 2 years struggling with Avolition / Alogia, I'm back on my feet but everything thanks to YOU people. I was losing hope that I will ever be that functional once again. With avolition I did what you said : To walk few steps every single day I today I had a lot of motivation and I walked throught my small city (\\~3Km) and I manage to walk half of my city on feet. I was bearly walking but after 2 years of staying in the house I'm finally able to joint the mainstream society. So what's the \"secret\" or the \"sience\" of this? Well, for Avolition I did just like you said : To walk small steps every single day. I started to get grocieries then I was able to be motivated to walk even more than this. Making my bed in the morning? Not a problem anymore. I had to accept that I'm not the person that I used to be, but I want to be someone. With Alogia is still hard but I find a way to manage it. I'm asking questions,  to join in conversation, to add words when someone forget the word that want to say it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be aware of the fact that I was on a low-dose of Amisulpride that so-called \"AP for negative symtoms\" but, to be honest with you I was on 7 months and it didn't work for me so the only solution that you have is to try a little harder to achive that goal that you wanted : To be functional. For some, the Amisulpride might be the solution but for me it wasn't so be more optimist.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to ask me anything in case that I miss something !\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Anything I wrote in my notes that was about me came true, like characteristics, for example if I wrote in my notes I am a nerd a would become this really good gamer or if I wrote I am a douche I would talk to girls like one it was a real interesting experience. As of now I no longer have this power. But back to the title I was watching a anime called jujutsu kaisen and in it the main character is possessed by a demonic spirit named Sukuna. So I decided to write in my notes “I am sukuna”. After this I become possessed by one of the voices I was hearing I’m pretty sure. It was like taking a backseat ride in my own body the spirit was controlling all my actions from walking to talking. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so please share your story. Also for more information earlier in my life I wrote on \non a piece of paper I sold my soul with a signature. Now the voices tell me they’re here because I sold my soul. I wrote the paper when I was like 16 years old without thinking so I guess you reap what you sow. I also wrote in my phone I opened my third ear as a joke not really knowing the meaning behind what that really might mean and now I hear voices. So I’m guessing it all started with me selling my soul which made manifestations come true from my phone which in turn lead to all this. So does anyone have a similar experience ? I know this was a long read but I had to share everything.",

I find people who smoke a ton of weed to be annoying actually.  I smoke weed.  It's not really an identity to me though, and I find the marijuana smokers to be like \"this is my identity\".  I find that shit trendy and annoying.  They deny their addictions by judging you and saying \"at least I'm not an alcoholic, weed is good for you\".  They ALL do this.  I've never seen some shit like this before, Jesus christ dude.\n\nI am looking for a cool girl, to be in a commitment relationship with.  Maybe not marriage, because that seems like we should get to know each other first better before we let Christ's crushing hands, define us as property that is now \"a public scene\".  \n\nI'm looking for a cool girl who just wants to chill and do cool shit.  I can't talk about my history openly, because it's way too amazing, and people shut down people they feel like they are in competition with, and people like to compete with me, and they happen to suck as well, so they get their asses whooped in the \"cool boy\" contest.

It’s all just some show everyone is putting on around me. How many people are fake and how many are also stuck in this simulation. \n\nSomething is up there just pushing buttons and making things happen. They laugh at misery. \n\nI don’t know what to do with myself now that I’m finding this out\n\nWhy do I bother at all with my day to day life. What have I been doing all these years. I see what’s real now. If I stray from what’s “normal” will something stop me. Something might try and come kill me. Do I need to keep playing this game or do my actions even matter?",

It's like schizophrenia is used more for shock value than as a way to genuinely portray people with the condition.\n\nIt’s not the biggest issue, but I do feel disheartened when people react negatively to the idea of headcanoning a character as schizophrenic, especially if that character already shows signs of psychosis or other symptoms. It often seems like there’s an attitude that there’s something “wrong” or somehow unacceptable about a beloved character having schizophrenia, as if giving them that label would “ruin” them or make them less relatable.\n\nThe stigma around this illness is honestly weird and I don't get why we're seen as something to be feared rather than people who are afraid. I made this post to see how others feel about this, and if you know any good schizophrenic characters, feel free to share.",

(schizoaffective disorder)\n\nI had the usual paranoia, accompanied by thought input and delusions of persecution and guilt.\n\n\n\nI got 15mg Abilify and Bupropion prescribed and the symptoms were reduced after a few months. So i went down to 5mg Abilify and 150mg Bupropion, which i was on for 6 years. (Bupropion increases the avaiability of Abilify so 5mg are more or less 10mg)\n\nUnfortunately even with just 5mg Abilify and 150mg Bupropion i was always tired, felt restlessness, had problems engaging social contacts, had motivation problems, some residual paranoia and so on.\n\nI also had very unpleasant cognitive problems. I couldn't remember things, i wasn't able to learn things (had severe problems with long term memory)  and sometimes my mind was cloudy with problems in orientation. In my opinion i had light dementia and was somehow hyperfocused. \n\nI also had severe generalized and social anxiety.\n\n\n\nIt didn't get better until 7 months ago i tried this combination:\n\n\\- 2\\* one of Armo Lipid Plus (which contains 500mg berberine, 2,8mg red yeast rice extract, folic acid and astaxanthine)\n\n  AND   \n\n  3\\*2,8mg monacolin K (lovastatin) from red yeast rice extract:\n\n  with this after 2-3 months i noticed no more cloudy brain and being much more clear headed in the morning. Also the residual paranoic thinking i had sometimes in the back of my brain disappeared. In short it helped me tremendously with my residual positiv symptoms and cognitive impairment.\n\nI was then able to reduce abilify further to 2,5mg a day without having any reappearance of positiv symptoms until now.\n\n\n\n\\- 3\\*500mg of a 4/6:1melissa officinalis extract with 5%rosmarinic acid: it reduces my anxiety a lot and helps with  my cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\n\\- i also still take\n\n\t\\- 150mg buprion and 1\\*green tea extract in the morning for energy and against depression \n\n\t\\- Vitamin E with all tocopherols\n\n\t\\- melatonin and theanine for sleep and to prevent positiv symptoms \n\n\n\nAlso\n\n\\- vigorous exercise (1h at high Zone 2 and 3) with a high dose of coffein (160-200mg) or guarana in the morning makes me more social and happy and gives me energy for the whole day\n\n  \n\n\nNow finally i feel very normal.\n\nI can think clearly, i can recall things a lot more easily, my word finding improved, short term memory is alot better, i can even learn again … i also like to talk o people (i am no longer bored of it), MY RESTLESSNESS DISAPPEARED! (what a relief!!) and my anxiety is a lot better ... \n\nIssues that remained is my interruptet sleep pattern(i wake up every 3 hours at night) and the absence of some emotions i had before schizophrenia.\n\n\n\nHopefully my psychosis stays aways.",

I’d feel good for a while from the anti psychotics but the symptoms would re appear either due to drugs or to my mind trying to “break” whatever the antipsychotic is chaining down. My psychiatrist two years ago said that I should be fine and could start tapering off the medicine slowly while supervised, and then I had an episode which reset everything and had to go up on a high dose to restart the process. The schizophrenic problem persists although it seems “camouflaged” by the anti psychotics. I want to be free of medicine but I still feel like the problem will never calm down and even on a high dose I can’t completely ignore it. I changed like 4 or 5 different types of antipsychotics (they either lost effectiveness due to an episode or they had really bad side effects for me) and my problem persists. I feel like I’m the only one in the world and I don’t want to be psychotic for the rest of my life! What the hell am I supposed to do?

My mom tell me to get a job but my schizophrenia has affected me so much it’s been hard for me to even focus. Some days I hope I get cancer from my invega even though I worry about getting cancer. It’s getting worse every day with my mother. My sister said that my mother will regret the things she has done when she gets older meaning when she retires. She is always and has been easily influenced by my father and my mother and father would both say I’m stupid late at night when I couldn’t get any sleep. I’m glad I at least have my sister by my side. My sister even knows that my mom is a huge drinker and we both rarely ever drink because of what my mother does. My sister tells me to let it go in and out the other ear. She says she isn’t influenced by my father but I know she is. No wonder I did so many drugs to make the pain go away so I’d at least be perfect to someone when I was doing drugs my parents accepted me I’d do it all over again the drugs just so I can look like what they want me to be the only thing is drugs caused my mental illness. Yeah I’d do accutane all over again illegally. I wish I had it again im addicted to something that shouldn’t be addictive. At least when I was skinny with no acne there were no problems. U know I just got involved with the wrong people and was sexually assaulted and that brought about my schizophrenia. Year after year I went into the hospital. I think my mother is troubled by something but idk what it is. I would always get off my medications because my mother would say there is nothing wrong with me and I’d get off my meds it was a continuous cycle. She would always say this when she was drunk. I had a dream not too long ago about a glass horse filling up with wine and then breaking, the glass horse was pulling a wagon and it made me think back to the Bible. Like the red horse and how it has to do with war it reminded me of what me and my mother are going through right now having arguments every time she drinks we have arguments. Now the arguments last into the next day. I don’t want kids and my sister probably won’t have kids either. We both realized it ourselves. I’m content with being alone the rest of my life, it would be a hard fact having schizophrenia and being tied down to someone ur not fully committed to. I realize life will be peaceful without any kids I’m just worried who will take care of me when I get old that’s why I’m hoping I’ll die young like in my 50s from cancer or my low iron. I know my invega will cause cancer my prolactin is already very high currently. It’s not depressing knowing I may die young it makes me happy to know I have a way out of life that won’t involve suicide. I wish life was different though all I can do is hope that life can get better despite what might happen to me as I get older due to medical complications that will ultimately end my life. I hope cancer isn’t too painful and I hope dying from low iron isn’t too painful as well.",

The science is not out yet, but basically the theory is based on the fact that people with schizophrenia have issues with mitochondria, and there are studies being done in China that could show positive outcomes. There are also other benefits for using metformin in schizophrenia besides mitochondria, but I was wondering what you guys thought of a drug helping the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. ",

My most disturbing symptom is a feeling and sensation in my head that is like I’m losing my control or sanity . I can’t describe it but by taking antipsychotics and mood stabilisers it becomes unbearable so I don’t take them anymore. Antidepressants are helpful but not really. Constantly ocd like vivid images that seem real. My question is I have never been diagnosed with personality disorders but I have this sense real actual sense of losing control in my head like a headache but not head ache I don’t know how to explain it . Have u ever experienced this feeling? Do you think I am schizophrenic?

        "Text": "Lately, I’ve been dealing with some intense feelings of paranoia and anxiety as well as hearing the voices of seemingly judgmental neighbors at home but also people around my neighborhood. \n\nI live in an apartment next to another, with a gap between where I feel like my neighbors are watching me. I smoke weed daily, and while I know that might contribute to my feelings, I’m still experiencing a lot of distress even when I’m sober. I’ll hear voices that sound like they’re coming from my neighbors, and sometimes it feels as if they know exactly what I’m doing, which makes me bring in the psychological aspect of it. \n\nI do know for fact the neighbors know I smoke because I used to go outside to do it, especially at some absolutely deplorable times of the day/night, but after noticing them watching/seeing me I opted to just smoke from my window and then even further reduced it to using a really good muffle so I can do it inside with no smell. \n\nAt times I can think something and hear that voice react/reply, to the point where it/they taunted me to come outside to my balcony facing their window, which I did, to no avail. Just stop there sorta talking out to this window like an idiot if it wasn’t actually someone there replying. My sister even came out and confirmed she could hear it but it was so faint to her but clear to me so that put me back on the fence. \n\nI’ve spoken to one neighbor who’s bedroom has the most direct view of my window, but even he could only see a tiny slit in the blinds where there’s some stuff they definitely wouldn’t be able to see that the voice I hear still happens to know somehow. They \ndidn’t give any indication of having bad intentions, but the proximity of their apartment makes it feel like they have a direct view into my space. I’ve got myself covering my laptop camera and blocking motion sensors in my room looking extra silly if this is nothing. \n\nWhen I hear these voices, I try to ignore them, but they can be persistent if I listen and engage, often bringing my anxiety between like 5 and 10 on a scale. And it’s always worse when I’m in my room or any other room with a direct eye-shot of their building. I’ve experienced similar feelings outside my apartment, like when I thought the security personnel for the area I live in were pointing me out and discussing me, as if I were the subject of gossip. ( At least that’s how it came off to me. ) \n\nI’m trying to manage these feelings and would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has had similar experiences or who has advice on how to cope. I’m starting by going cold turkey today. ",

It's a way to express things we think but we don't want to see or hear, so that things just materialize. They do that because it's our own opinion we MUST see or hear that things in order to evolve for the better, in order to adapt to the change, give our best and survive by overcoming our fears and changing a sick perspective on the world. \n\nWith that being said, the hard part is to overcome being afraid of delusions and to keep delusions apart from actual reality. No one should ever be ashamed of having a tool to understand ourselves better. \n\nI think the most useful thing we can do is to treat delusions as our allies, because they are actually here to help us upgrading. As soon as I changed my perspective in this way, my mood improved so much and my occasional delusions (because I'm on a med that is really working) with me. Asking them questions about why they behave in that way, prove them wrong, and so on. I think negative voices actually want to be proven wrong, do you know what I mean? And seeing things is actually a way to purge our subconscious. \nLike vomiting something wrong for US that the circumstances put in out minds. Maybe it's banal, but I think everyone should keep all this in mind. What do you think?\n\nBest wishes people, we are so special and gifted \n",

        "Text": "My old therapist (who I had a bad falling out with when I was a teenager) doesn't believe I have autism despite getting professionally diagnosed with autism through extensive psychological testing by someone who works under him as an education specialist therapist who also focuses on neurodiversity. My old therapist's reasoning is that my symptoms could be attributed to schizophrenia (which he diagnosed me with at age 15) and that my mother's revised reports about my childhood didn't include social deficits (which I believe is because my mother didn't think my frequent daily/weekly meltdowns and lack of friends were notable, for some reason...) Although, surprisingly, her initial reports about my childhood DID include the fact that I struggled to make friends and was greatly affected by that, she decided to send in a second report omitting this, for reasons I do not know.\n\nOnce I was diagnosed with autism, instead of validation and relief, I felt anxiety over the fact that my mother would likely not believe my diagnosis, because she values the old therapist's opinion very highly. I know for a fact that you can have schizophrenia and autism at the same time, I've seen many people who say they do, but am I wrong for being annoyed that my old therapist isn't considering comorbidity for me? Is it really that hard to recognize both? Why does schizophrenia rule out autism?\n\nI haven't spoken to my old therapist in years beyond basic emailing for the psychological testing that he had to send me. He most definitely isn't getting updated information about my mental state. He sees my mother as her own therapist now, though, which is why she is so set on his word over mine and others.\n\nI feel defeated. I went through all the hoops of seeking a autism diagnosis, doing the testing, and providing all the information I thought the professionals needed, but my diagnosis is still debated over. I thought that having a diagnosis would mean the end of me constantly second-guessing and gaslighting myself, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of imposter syndrome, despite the official diagnosis. What should I do, in this situation? I'm tired of constantly trying to defend myself and trying to get people to believe me. I feel like people DON'T want to believe me.",

I usually see patterns of faces and eyes on walls or floors, but that hasn’t happened—even when I try to look for it. Pretty promising so far! The acid reflux and heartburn were about half as bad and only lasted for an hour or so. The new medication seems to be kicking in quickly and is much more effective than Abilify at reducing my symptoms. Also, my memory feels sharper. (Which is wild because I have a crazy good memory already, I’m a software engineer so keeping track of the state of data as code manipulates it is important.)\n\n-Update-\n\nDay 3:\n\nToday has been pretty good. The nausea and heartburn side effects have completely gone away. I felt anxious a few times, but I think that was from drinking too much caffeine. I’m still seeing improvements in my cognitive functioning and fewer psychotic symptoms, which is promising. I’m now on my third day of taking only 2 mg of Abilify alongside Cobenfy. So far, I haven’t experienced any major withdrawal symptoms, but it might be too early to tell. Next week, my doctor and I will decide whether I’ll stop Abilify entirely or take 2 mg every other day for a week.\n\nI’m already noticing weight loss, probably from lowering my Abilify dose. Before I started antipsychotics, I was in peak shape—165 lbs at 8% body fat—but over time, I went up to 220 lbs. I’m still athletic, but I really hope the theory that Cobenfy may help with weight loss holds up, as I’d love to get back to my six-pack.\n\nAt work, I noticed I was able to focus for longer periods today. I’m already a strong software developer, but if my performance improves further from getting off Abilify, that would be great, as I’m very success-driven. I’m seeing a new therapist next week—my sixth attempt—and I’m hoping this one will be a better fit. I have a lot of past trauma and PTSD, partly from my psychotic episodes. The big milestone will be if my psychotic symptoms stay away for at least a month after I’m fully off Abilify. In the past, they would usually return within one to three weeks after stopping.\n\n-update-\n\nAfter one Week:\n\nAfter a week on Cobenfy, things are going well. I’m off Abilify, and I’m losing weight quickly—about 5 pounds a week—even though I haven’t changed my diet. A few days ago, I went out and drank quite a bit, and I didn’t notice any negative reactions. Honestly, if I can get back to my pre-antipsychotic weight and keep the psychosis at bay, it’ll be like living the life I’ve always dreamed of. My memory feels sharper, too. I’m finding it easier to remember words and make connections, which used to be tough—I’d often have words right on the tip of my tongue but couldn’t get them out. That’s happening less now, which feels really good.\n\n-Update-\n\nAfter two weeks:\n\nStill losing weight, over the weekend I went to the bar, then the strip club with the wife and friends. I killed it socially and didn’t dissociate as much as I normally do. I drank quite a bit and didn’t have any psychotic symptoms the next day which is a good sign. Over all I feel more normal and like I can relate to other people. My sleep is getting better as-well. I still sometimes get bad heart burn after taking cobenfy but Pepcid alleviates it. I’ve also learned about cobenfy co pay assistance program so the medication is now zero dollars a month!",

And no one will change my diagnosis. \n\nEvery time I close my eyes, images of the dead and demonic forces enter my sight. I dream of dead people. And when I wake up they’re still in my room talking to me. I’m so sick of this.\n\nThe only thing that helps is olazapine, but it made me gain 40 pounds so fucking fast. I take metformin now to try and help reverse it but that doesn’t seem to work.\n\nI have not being able to sleep. In high school I loved sleep. I could do it 24/7. Now? I sleep maybe 2-4 hours, filled with nightmares, only to wake up to visions of death. \n\nWhat the hell? This illness sucks. The more tired I am, the more voices I hear. They’re like angry whispers arguing over my soul like demons and angels. Or more like two armies of demons. Idk. It’s all a mess, and it’s so loud. \n\nAny advice?",

I've improved significantly over the years still will never be free of this ever. But like I said earlier. Is it common to get diagnosed at that age?

In addition to weight gain, I also feel like I have some restlessness and akathisia from Abilify.  These are all great reasons to switch!\nCobenfy is a cholinergic drug.  I read that it can be very expensive.  Looks like the most common side effects are constipation and nausea. It’s the first novel treatment for schizophrenia in decades!",

        "Text": "I’m 30 years old, and I lost my younger brother (28) five months ago in the most traumatic way imaginable. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and possibly bipolar disorder, but unfortunately, that didn’t spare him from being jailed for five months for a mistake he made, even though he was mentally unwell. When he finally came home, we thought we could support him and help him heal, but that peace lasted only two months before things took a devastating turn.\n\nOne Saturday, he sent me a long, chaotic message that ended with him saying he was going to end it all, even urging me to do the same. I could tell he was going through an episode, but I had no idea what was coming. I rushed to where he said he’d be, only to discover he had set himself on fire in public. His bloody footprints were everywhere. The ambulance took him to the hospital, and on the way there, we got the call saying he wouldn’t make it due to the severe burns all over his body.\n\nI couldn’t accept it. I screamed at the doctor on the phone, refusing to believe that my brother was dying. When we got to the hospital, I saw him lying there, barely breathing, covered in burns from head to toe. I’ll never forget that feeling – the helplessness, the disbelief, and the overwhelming grief. He was able to say he loved us one last time before passing away peacefully after a few hours.\n\nIn the days that followed, my family and I had to prepare him for burial. Because of our faith, we needed to wash his body, and even though it was painful beyond words, I decided to do it with my friend and cousin. Pouring water over his burned skin and saying goodbye in this way is something I’ll never fully come to terms with.\n\nSince then, life has slowly returned to some kind of ‘normal,’ but I still see his face every night before I sleep. My heart breaks thinking about his suffering, and while I know he’s free from his illness now, I just miss him so much. I’m sharing this here because I know grief takes time, and sometimes it helps to know we’re not alone.\n",

Mom had Alzheimer’s as well as metastatic lung cancer that spread to the brain.  \n\nMy sister was her primary caregiver since sis was out of work (terminated due to excessive absence, constant sickness due to an autoimmune disease).  Mom was a normal average person but she turned violent with my sister.  There were days sis had to hide in the bathroom.\n\nSis suffered hallucinations both audible and visual.  They were mean hallucinations.\n\nShe’s under control thankfully.  She takes other meds to combat the TD, and also a drug to help alleviate her night terrors (reliving moms dying at hubs moments constantly).  However, I have noticed that she spends most of her time sleeping.  \n\nShe never seems the same as the sis I grew up with.  She has forgetfulness and doesn’t seem to be able to focus.  She used to do all the bills and tax prep and it all literally fell in my lap (I was very unprepared to deal with it but made it through).\n\nI have done some reading and it sounds like this is often par for the course.  \n\nI just would like to know from others if this is the meds or the disease or a combination.  I just want her to get the best help possible.  \n\nI heard about Cobenfy but alas her insurance doesn’t cover it.\n",

I’m pretty isolated and have been for years should I just continue, anyone else have issues with family ? ",

        "Text": "Hello people,\n\nJust to share about something that works a bit for me. I have a relapsed few month ago and negativ symptoms increased. So I am doing again my adapted cold shower the morning and it helps me get my stuff done for the morning hours. The effect get less strong as the day goes, but it gives me some hours of effective motivation.\n\nRegular cold shower do not work for me and increase my disorganization. Maybe because schizophrenia is stress related and that cold shower is actually stressfull for the body. So here is the protocol that get me working and not lost in mental confusion :\n\n* First, I take my usual very warm morning shower (i dont dring coffee, warm shower during the morning is what wake me up). \n* When my body is warm and I feel I got enough warm water (can be 10 minutes, or 20 minutes. Dont juge me please \\^\\^') I reduce warm water to have temperature were I feel OK but that is not pleasant. \n* I put water on my back and from this point I will look for the temperature that is cold enough to make me gasp. Not more. My purpose is really just to provoc a gasp for air, not colder.\n* When I get the right temperature and I gasp for air, I expose my back and my chest with it during 10 to 20 seconde, then stop my shower and begin my day.\n\nIf I go too far and get colder, I trigger disorganisation and I can not work nore focus on anything. If I get the good gasp, I can focus.\n\nHope it helps. \n\n",

I'm delusional more often than hallucinating, and I'm paranoid as hell. \n\nHere's my main concern, I have stopped taking my medication for around a week now. (Before you come for me, I have my very valid reasons. I can explain more if you need.) \n\nSo far, the paranoia, delusions, and voices and stuff are about the same as they were on medication. My only problem is there's *something* on my back. I know it's not real, but I feel like a demon or something is literally clinging to my back. I can't get rid of the feeling. You know that feeling when you're being watched, and you can feel the hairs stand up on the back of your neck? Or when you turn out the basement lights and have to run as fast as you can up the stairs because you feel like something is following you? I have the feeling 24/7. I'm trying not to let it bother me. I survived for years with this as a child before I was diagnosed, so surely I can make it again? I just can't shake it! I've been rotting in my bed for the past 4 days just trying to distract myself from the horrible pressure on my back. I haven't seen the sun in over a month. (I have an overnight job and I sleep during the day.)\n\nIs this something I should be concerned about? I was completely fine for years and I only had my first psychotic episode this year. I keep trying to convince myself that I can survive without medication. Maybe I'll learn to live with this creepy feeling and I'll be fine. What should I do? ",

The cries seem endless, resonating in the hollow void, unanswered.\n\nThere is no light in this place, only the gnarled grin of a malevolent god, one who offers deceitful promises and feeds on despair.

I’ve already been diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety. \n\nFor the last 5 months I’ve felt like there is bugs infestation in my house, I feel them crawling on me, and my skin burns. It feels so very real to me, but I’m the only one that feels this. I thought maybe allergic reaction so I made sure to take every allergen known to man out of the house & begin using hypoallergenic everything. I’ve spent my whole paychecks on this infestation, and removing allergens (cleaning products) to top it off I collect the “findings” on lint roller pieces and use my phone magnifying app to study them FOR HOURS. \n\nI feel as if everyone is against me all the time, and I’m scared to get help due to my son. I’m scared he’ll get taken from me. I feel as though my boyfriend is plotting against me with my grandmother. Or that everyone at work hates me or is talking about me behind my back. \n\nI hear voices, but I cannot seem to make them out, it’s more like as though you are in a separate room or inside and you can hear someone having a convo in the yard. I smell like something is BURNING but there’s not. \n\nI’m so angry and depressed all of the time I don’t find joy anymore whatsoever. I just want to lay. I have no energy, I hate socializing and phone calls. I avoid phone calls at all cost. I feel like my phone listens to me & is recording me. Or they can see me through my camera. When I do have energy I spend it doing a cleaning ritual of steam cleaning everything and rewashing clothes that I just washed due to paranoia. I have to wash my son’s toys multiple times if he drops it once I’m scared there’s some life altering germ on it that could kill him. \n\nI wasn’t too big into religion until this, I wouldn’t say I’ve become obsessed, but I have found a bigger interest in Christianity, or if I do something that may upset God Ill be sent to hell. \n\nSounds overwhelm me. I cannot have too loud of sounds or tv. I need to be aware of all sounds at all times in the house. I cannot seem to get my words out at times, or they jumble together.\n\nI had a good bond with my son until all of this happened, now I’m afraid something in the house in contaminating him like black mold, the “mites,” or bugs, or that if I’m affected by them then I’ll transfer them to him. I cannot be left alone with him I have severe panic attacks. I called 911 5 times in one week. \n\nI’m at a loss, and I feel so hopeless. I just needed somewhere to vent where I won’t feel as though I’m mostly judged or misunderstood. For the last 5 months I’ve slowly been deteriorating mentally & physically. Like I said, I’m PETRIFIED to go to the doctor due to my son being taken, but if you had to assume does this sound like any of similar early schizophrenia symptoms? Could I be delusional & in psychosis? I’m so paranoid all of the time, it makes me just not even want to be here. \n\nThank you if you took the time to read this.. I know it’s very long, but I feel as though I’m losing my boyfriend, son, and most importantly myself. ",

        "Text": "My best friend with schizoaffective disorder is living with me right now.  She moved in with me and my mum and sister because she was hospitalised twice and doesn’t have a job and she’s not in university anymore as she is taking a gap semester or two due to her mental health.  She is in an outpatient programme now and on medication, but her delusions seem to be getting worse.  I just pretend to believe her delusions when they don’t affect me, but she had a delusion where she believed she was Jewish and she named all these antisemitic incidents she’s allegedly faced.  I can’t go into complete detail here but I will say that she said she’s been called the k-slur all her life (which she didn’t know even existed until she met me) and the k-slur in Russian by her Russian ex-boyfriend (again, a slur she didn’t know existed until she met me).  She knows I am Jewish and that Judaism is very near and dear to me, and that I have grown up facing all kinds of antisemitism.  She insists that she has grown up Jewish and has practised Jewish holidays and was offended when I told her that I needed to bring up that I was being affected by this delusion.  Eventually, she apologised.  She still believes that she grew up Jewish, though.  \n\nBut now she has a different delusion.  It’s more recent.  In one of the hospitals she went to, she saw a black woman who was allegedly the singer Lauryn Hill and she apparently had a revelation that Lauryn Hill is her mother.  That means she’s half black.  She goes on about being biracial now.  Mind you, she’s fully white, Cajun French to be specific.  But she knows I am biracial and she claims the biracial card a lot and she’s even going as far as putting her hair in curls because it’s her “natural hair” and I think it might be more than just offensive towards me that she’s claiming to be biracial all of a sudden; she saw a random black woman in the hospital and she thinks it’s Lauryn Hill.  Maybe I’m being a jerk and holding her to the standards of a non-schizoaffective person, but this is really hurting me.  There have been other delusions where she has said that I was in a room while everyone took turns assaulting her and I did nothing, and another delusion that blamed me for something that I won’t get into.  She apologised for those, though.  \n\nMy mum told me to only “correct” her delusions when it actually affects someone negatively.  My mum says this doesn’t affect me.  We are both trying our best but don’t see eye to eye.  My friend is upset that I don’t believe that she’s biracial and that Lauryn Hill is her mum.  She constantly brings up that Lauryn Hill is her biological mum and that she has naturally curly hair and that she’s biracial.  I feel like it affects me.  Am I overreacting?  What should I do?  \n\nEdit: She also knows I’m autistic and that I have Tourette Syndrome, POTS, and dyscalculia and now she thinks she has those, albeit she has thought she has had autism since she met me and has said I made her realise she’s autistic.  She also started having tics when she met me, and she has started having the exact same tics as me recently.  They trigger my tics.  She doesn’t even know what POTS is and she claims to have it.  My mum has us go on walks with her every morning and I can never make it on the walk, meanwhile my mum and her are able to go on runs.  It doesn’t make sense for her to have POTS if she’s able to exercise so easily and go on runs like that.  And like I said, she doesn’t even fully understand what POTS is.  \n\nI also don’t want it to look like I don’t care about my friend.  When she was first hospitalised, no one had any idea where she was or that she was hospitalised.  It was like she went missing.  I was the one who jumped through hoops to get a missing persons report, get the university involved so we could check the cameras on campus to see how she disappeared (she seemed to disappear on the university campus), and I called every hospital in our city once I found out she was hospitalised to find out where she was.  I’m sorry if it looks like I’m being a jerk and holding my friend to impossibly high standards.  ",

Instead I just go through my day doing the minimal amount of things that allows me to move to the next day: eating, taking long naps, taking a shower and so on. I kind of feel like I'm just a sentient rock in a sense, devoid of the kind of emotions and thoughts that drive most \"healthy\" people. In the face of this massive illness it all just starts to seem kind of meaningless to me, to be honest. I feel like I'm less than a \"normal\" person and my experience of the world is somehow skewed and tainted. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying this and many of you can relate to some degree at least. Despite all of this bleakness and negativity how do you guys find things to be passionate about? What force motivates you to pursue your hobbies? I'm genuinely curious and I'd love to hear about your experiences.",

I don’t even know what I’m asking, but I guess I’m more so confessing that realizing I’ve been living in my delusions for the last 44 years (because, honestly I don’t believe I ever lived a day without them) so, realizing this, and all the other dots connecting (I know I know), well, to say I’ve been going through it today, mentally and emotionally, is a serious understatement. Because this has certainly been one brutal day.

This community seems wonderful and understanding, so thank you all for making this space what it is.\n\nBut anyway, I stopped medication a little under a year ago, and ever since then, I have had a very difficult time with emotions. It feels as though I never experience them, and if I do, they feel very numbed down. It’s hard for me to find joy in the things I used to find joy in. It’s caused me to isolate a lot, because I feel as though I cannot experience things the same way other people do anymore. I have lost a lot of my hobbies, or just engage in them much less. My family has noticed, and they’re worried I’m depressed, it just feels like such a complicated concept to explain. I really don’t feel depressed, I just feel nothing, or next to nothing.\nDoes the anhedonia ever go away, or lessen in effect? I’m considering starting meditation again, just so I can actually feel things, more or less. Is there any advice anybody has? Anything that can make me feel again? I feel as though I’m stuck this way forever, in a cycle of seeing things through dull and tired eyes.\nThank you for reading this far, if you did. I’m always open to advice. ",

I was in a ongoing very stressful situation that have seemingly triggered \"schizophrenia-compatible symptoms\" as the doctors put it. Since then, these symptoms are still present and I have regular appointments with a psychiatrist, as well as other form of therapy. Since this first breakdown, I feel like I have changed a lot, especially in the social domain.\n\n  \nWhile in the hospital, I met this girl via a dating app. We'll call her L. I didn't fell in love with her, neither did she, however we became great friends. \n\n  \nShe is currently on holiday with one of her friends, and that friend wanted me to send L a cute message so she'd have a genuine smile for a picture. I wasn't in the mood, so I just told her that. Later, she told me that she didn't took it very well. She was obviously fine for me to express my boundaries but that my message was a bit blunt.\n\nAnd this morning, as we were discussing how I was feeling, she told me that she was glad I was sharing these informations with her to help her understand me better, and that these infos will help her know that my actions are not her fault. I answered saying that she absolutely will make mistakes and do things that'll trigger me and it's ok. Re-rereading my message, I feel like it's kinda harsh and insensitive. She hasn't answered yet.\n\n  \nDo y'all have any tips to avoid this kind of situation ?\n\n  \nThank you very much\n\n\n\n(I have a doubt on the right flair to add, since I'm undiagnosed, but it would be more relevant putting a \"Relationships\" flair maybe ?",

(the worst they got was chanting \"stupid! stupid!\" at me bc i had an off-hand thought about calling myself stupid) so i called my mom who was out at the time. i had her in my right ear and then the incoherent noise coming from my brain in my left ear, which was... REALLY weird. cool, but terrifyingly weird.\n\nmy mom ended up taking me to the ER where i felt very rudely unwelcomed bc (TANGENT INCOMING, what might be a mildly triggering ER experience, you can skip it)\n\nnot only did they rob me of all of my possessions (stuffed animals, my purse of knick knacks and fidget toys) that i brought with me for emotional support + my clothes, the room they put me in was fucking awful, discomforting and threatening???? blank, empty walls with ominous punches/shags/cuts/scratches in the wall, a bed attached to the floor that wasn't even a bed it was a fucking table, and then just leaving me with nothing but the thing that's trying to kill me--- MY BRAIN???? if my mom wasnt there with me i would've lost my patience and bashed my head into the wall just to prove a point... even though i really didnt have to. the evidence was already there. you can't 'stop' people from hurting themselves--- but you *can* offer them comfort and support. instead, i opted for very passively aggressively saying things like \"why are you giving us cups of water? i thought we can’t have anything in here. whys my mom still wearing shoes?\" whenever they brought something in there LOL\n\n(END TANGENT)\n\nit is worth mentioning that we upped my dose of wellbutrin a week or so before this happened, and apparently a side effect it can have is auditory hallucinations. we immediately went back down on the dose, and i havent heard anything nearly as loud and clear since... however, if i sit in silence and stop and focus, i can very faintly hear the lyrics to a song if i know it well and sing it in my thoughts. but it's very, VERY faint and much more deliberate than the \"sweet and sticky\"s were.\n\ni did some research online and found out about \"musical ear syndrome\", but that is typically only found in people with hearing loss... not in 18 year olds, which just makes me even more curious about wtf happened in my head on the 21st.\n\ni was just wondering if anyone on here might have any insight, advice, ideas or thoughts about any of this?",

        "Text": "**TRIGGER WARNING, FAMILIAL SA IS MENTIONED** this is going to be long because it's such a deep rooted and long, ongoing story. \n\nHi all, my (f23) brother who's 28, about to be 29 in a week, has been suffering for a very long time. He's had many, many, many episodes over the last 10 years when everything came to a head. He was kicked out of the house at 17/18 for sneaking into my room at night, lifting my blankets up, with his phone flash light on. Long story short, he broke all his phones and computers afterwards, has vaguely admitted to doing 'this' to all of me, my younger sister, and my mother for many years. I remember him being in my room at night before, but he'd always have an excuse and I NEVER thought anything of it. Even when actually weird shit happened when I had friends over. I never even imagined or went there.. but I've come to terms with the fact that he's very possibly touched/looked/ or taken pictures of my body and I'll never really fully know what all he's done because he's always tried to justify it in some freaky Sigmund freud bs. I am as healed as I can be, but it still bothers me of course, and because of his reoccurring delusional surrounding this situation, that me and my family are out like secretly bringing the cops against him and things of that nature. There's been many other delusions and I mostly just hear thru my mom or family who deals with him regularly, because he's made a lot of us uncomfortable a lot of times, ina. Sexual manner, and we are his victims. So we keep our distance-- but that doesn't mean we don't hurt and worry for him. I see him at family events but like for instance, I'm pregnant and won't be inviting him to my baby shower this weekend which happened to fall on his bday. It's just such a complicated relationship and I love him unconditionally, deeply, but I won't jeapordize my healing process for someone who has --knowingly or not-- been my predator. \n\nHe's really unwell. He has done dangerous things before including driving into traffic, and once wrecking into someone's house while drunk. He can't keep jobs but he somehow manages to keep an apartment. For the first time, he's shown his true mind to ME personally, and he texted me not making any sense at all, asking me if I'm allowed to talk about what I did today and yesterday, not believing me when I told him I hadn't traveled anywhere. Weird stuff, but like, he genuinely doesn't trust me and thinks someone is controlling me. And he's had very open talks to my mom about hearing voices and that my mom's voice is a trigger and antagonist to him. \n\nWhat can you do? When someone is so unable to realize that what they are experiencing is not real and he needs help. But he's also not a safe person for us to be around all the time, and my mom is a big trigger for him --something they've talked about openly, when he's well. Today I told him I loved him very much, and I'm always here for him to talk to and that Ive got no motive or reason to lie to him, always will keep it 100% and to take deep breaths because I could tell he wasn't okay, he told me he wasn't. My aunt and uncle have taken him under their wing, even to an extent it's caused tension at times between my aunt and mother because it's as if my aunt is entirely blind to the fact that we are also his literal VICTIMS. We live in the states and mostly it seems like you can't force someone to get help 'unlwss they're deemed a danger to themselves or society,' and to me, I understand why you can't just get someone taken to get help, but what, do we wait until he hurts himself or someone else? I always feel like something bad will happen eventually and everything comes to a head eventually, and I'm scared for that. My heart aches for him because I grew up remembering being kids together and I ache for the fact I can never have that normal relationship with my brother. And I hurt that there's not more I can do as his family. Any advice is helpful, sorry for ranting. ",

        "Text": "I'm so confused. On one hand I know things I experience are not things other people without this kind of mental illness experience, but on the other hand I feel with my whole being that there is nothing wrong with me. I feel truly that I have just somehow misrepresented my experiences to myself and others in a way that has made it seem like I am sick when I am not. But then again if I am sick the way my psychiatrist and therapist and everyone thinks then I WOULDN'T know, would I? That is so weird to me. I am so uncomfortable trying to think about all of this. I am so confused and I wish I could figure out. I am torn. Half of me thinks \"There is nothing wrong\" and I'm so close to stopping all my meds. And the things that people might think make me disconnected from reality are things that if they experienced then they would know it's not all coincidence. Stay with me. I know it sounds insane. But there are too many coincidences and I don't think I'm reading too much into it. \n\nI see the same numbers over and over again everywhere every day and then I was looking at license plates and they all began with \"A\" or \"Y\". They were A until I noticed and then they were all Y (not that they changed, those were the ones I began to see). And then I was thinking \"I don't see messages in them the way I did before medication as often, and I don't need the medication. It is coincidence that they have stopped being messages as much and that's what they want me to think--that it's the meds working. When Really I am sedated.\" \n\nSo I was thinking that and then right at that moment I tuned back into the music I was listening to, and the lyrics were \"Am I going insane?\" And that felt like a message but it wasn't like the radio was creating a message to speak to me, it was like it was the conduit of something else that was speaking to me. So it wasn't the radio talking to me, it was something else. And that is what I can't explain to people. They think when I say the radio is talking to me that I mean the radio is talking to me but what I mean is that \"coincidences\" appear in front of me in a way that I think they could for anyone, but I am noticing them in a way not everyone does and when I do notice them it is clear they mean something together even if that meaning isn't obvious to other people. \n\nI told my psychiatrist I hear voices but I don't hear them constantly. It's only sometimes and I haven't heard them in a while (a few days) and I think it's because the medicine is keeping me from receiving things the way I'm supposed to. I'm not sick, it's that my brain is working in a different way and I want it back like that I don't want them to change my brain around. I want to be able to hear things the way I'm supposed to. And when I take my meds I feel like it stops that and it shouldn't because they are rearranging me. \n\nNone of this is the kind of thing I think is truly disconnected from reality in a way that would require me to take medication or that means a diagnosis would make sense for me. I am taking up too much from other people who actually need it by taking my medication and I am tricking everyone. It is the exact evil that those messages warn me about. They all are warnings that I am an evil person and it is a manifestation of the inside of my true self appearing externally and the voices are right when they tell me that I am destined to die because of it. And I hear them inside my head most of the time anyway--not outside, out loud. They whisper mostly. They whisper my name and I don't know how to make anyone understand that when I say that I hear voices that it isn't how they think usually. It isn't like most representations, but I know others experience it this way too. It isn't that I think I'm better than anyone. in fact I really WISH I WAS SICK because then it would make everything make sense but I just CANNOT accept it because I just KNOW so deeply that I am not and that is almost worse because it means I am just an evil liar who has tricked my psychiatrist or worse she is giving me medication because the pharmaceutical company just wants us to fit within a certain standard and I am outside of the normative deviation and that is all that it is. \n\nNo matter what I do no one believes me and I don't know how to explain I am perfectly in touch with reality and that I am just not explaining myself clearly because it is so hard to explain. \n\nAnd sometimes I even ask my friends if they think that they can tell if I am sick or not and sometimes they don't know and then I can know that I am not actually sick because if they would observe it then maybe it would be but it isn't. \n\nSomeone help me please",

[For example, if he is just barely awakened and scrolling through TikTok, lazy in bed, but doesn’t pick up on WhatsApp— I assume he is talking to someone else].\n\nWhen we first started dating, I opened up to him about my biggest fear: betrayal, whether it’s being cheated on or being talked about behind my back. \n\nPart of this also comes from not feeling good enough for him sometimes, even though he constantly tries to tell me that I am. Our love languages are different—mine is more words, while his is physical touch, like hugs, which makes it harder because of the long distance. I know he’s doing his best, but these feelings are still there.\n\nHow can I stop feeling this way and let myself trust in the love we have?  I genuinely love him, and I’m afraid that if I let these feelings grow, I might lose trust in him and end up self-sabotaging our relationship. \n\n!!! As I’m typing this, I realize it might sound ridiculous, but as a schizophrenic who’s been through SA and betrayal, this is the first relationship where I genuinely don’t want to sabotage things or become toxic.\n\nAnd the truth is, whenever we talk and there are gaps in replies or change of tone, I have a panic attack.

Like i’m probably going to try to get a girlfriend once im having less side effects on new med and will probably have to drive to see her and who knows how far of a drive that will be. You would think that since I have SSI disability, they would encourage me to get a gf since getting married means they stop paying you SSI and medicaid. I would find it hard to believe that they would discourage this. But that’s what i would like to know. \n\nTldr: how many of you US folks have ssdi or ssi disability and drive (and the Social Security Admin knows you drive)?",

I really want to lose the weight I’ve gained on this medication, but the main issue is that these meds cause me to feel hungry 90% of the time + I get insane cravings, when I was on quetiapine I’d wake up in the middle of the night (2 am) to go eat something because of how hungry I felt. any tips on weight loss while on these meds? any help would be really appreciated!",

        "Text": "Hi, I'm 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 18 and that was also around the time of my last med change.\n\nI've been over a year and a half without a hospization and psychosis but because of my past with mental struggles and hospitalizations, my parents have been monitoring my meds every night since I left treatment in 2023 (and actually before that now that I think about it) but I've talked with my psychiatrist and my parents and they've agreed to give me control over my meds again so I can take them without supervision, without waiting for them to give them to me, I can call them in and know when to get more, I can spend the night with friends and not have to ask permission to bring a dose with me, I can do it all on my own!!\n\nI've been on meds since I was 16 and specifically an antipsychotic that did not help and actually made things worse. I would forget to take meds or the opposite and was not able to trust myself then. I've been hospitalized four times since 16 and this year (2024) I've gone without any and very much hope I can make it to 2025 without any visits too!!\n\nI'm very happy that I've rebuilt the trust with myself and my parents. I'm proud that I can have this part of my independence back and so thankful I'm doing better than I have been in awhile. Having literally graduated highschool in a psych ward and not going to college, I often get down on myself for being behind compared to others my age but I'm trying to be patient with myself and find what works for me at my own pace. Overall still so so grateful. Might seem really silly or small or unrelatable to others but I'm very excited at my growth. :))\n\n\n\nTLDR: I can take my meds without supervision for the first time in 2+ years and am very proud!",

I’m a f21yo college student now, struggling more with my negative symptoms than my positive ones. I just lost my last friend after coming out as a lesbian and now I’m completely alone. I’m in my 2nd year at a major university abroad, but I struggle so badly with anxiety and self hatred and low energy that I can hardly leave my room and I haven’t made any friends here at all as a result. I don’t have any siblings either, so once my parents, who are already aging, die, I just won’t have anyone at all. I’m taking a host of different meds for my condition, I’ve had years of CBT and social adjustment therapy and it just feels like none of it matters. If my parents pass away and I’m still all alone, I will probably end up taking my own life. There’s a chance it’s the schizophrenia, but I consistently feel that the strangers around me hate me and are burdened by me and I just can’t take it for another 50 or so years. \n\n    I do want to be better, I’m just not sure how or where to start. It feels like everyone already has a friend group or just doesn’t like me. If anyone my age/recently my age can drop some tips on how to get over the social anxiety slowly, I would love to take them. Words of encouragement would also be appreciated, I’m at the end of my line and would just like to be talked to. Thank you to everyone in advance, American in the UK if that helps",

Financial help stopped (I live with my parents and got a small but considerable stipend of the equivalent of 135 USD every week.

My dad vowed to not give me a single cent. I deserve it and should probably not have received a stipend in the first place. Irresponsible and selfish. My psychiatrist has offered me a government rehab program and I want to either ask her to check me in to that or choose the psych ward… I’m not entirely sure which one to choose at the moment though.

This is the 6th time in two years he’s had to be hospitalized, each stay being a month minimum.

There is so much I could say, and am happy to if anyone is interested.  Let’s just say that Jeckel and Hyde got nothing on my baby… he doesn’t get violent, not in the 10 years he’s been suffering from it, but unfortunately I play the villain in his delusions and he makes life pretty rough.

He paces back and forth often & has insomnia. If you have a conversation with him you have to be careful with what you say because he will twist your words or try and decipher some meaning behind them. \n\nHe’d been going into mine & my roommates room & took my knife. He’s never been violent, he’d just been playing with knives. I was worried about him going through with his plan so I had a mental health team & the police take him in. They cuffed him. He doesn’t know that I read his journal or know about his plan and is confused on why he’s there. He doesn’t understand that it’s just a hospital stay and not him being arrested even though he’s been told he’s not in trouble. \n\nHe said he was told I called him a threat. I never said that. He was very angry and probably still is. He doesn’t like me or any of our family. He’s asked the social worker assigned to him for a lawyer. He thinks everyone is lying to him.
