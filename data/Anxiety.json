        "Text": "Hello friends!\n\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/Anxiety  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\n\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\n\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\n\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\n\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\n\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\n\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\n\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\n\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. Here is a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fanxiety)\n\nStay safe out there!",

I was prescribed Lexapro last week and I was so excited to try it because I’m so desperate for relief. I only took it for 2 days and my experience was TERRIBLE. Whole body skin flushing, dilated pupils, mild nausea, eye pain, increased anxiety, panic attacks. So bad that I went a day and a half without eating or drinking and couldn’t get out of bed for 2 days. My doctor told me to stop immediately and she said to take a few weeks off and then I can try Zoloft. \n\nI’m absolutely terrified to start another SSRI but I again am so desperate for relief from my anxiety and my brain constantly trying to convince me that I’m going to die. I realize I can have different experiences with each medication but I’m afraid to go through this again.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences? How has Zoloft worked for you?",

I remember the 2016 election cycle, and the next four years after that, I was deep in my doomscrolling and it seemed like every time I refreshed or opened an app, some new ridiculous, dangerous, ugly thing was being reported.\n\nIt affected my mental health so much and drove me into having panic attacks, aggression, nihilism, and even suicidal thoughts once in a while. I know this time will not be any different, and in fact, will probably be *much* worse.\n\nI told my wife as soon as the results were out that it's a great idea to get off of social media as much as possible, as it's only going to make things worse. So I advise you all, for the sake of your mental health, limit your screen time. Go outside, read, exercise, play music, hang with friends, do what you gotta do to escape this reality and do what's best for you.\n\nWe live once, and things like this are usually outside of our control, so it's best to focus on you and the people you love and care about. I love you guys, good luck to you all out there, and take care of yourselves and each other.\n",

When i doing strenous activity for a job or just simply working out my raised pulse makes me spiral and start thinking about all the things i have to worry about which makes me pulse even faster.\n\nFor me at least, mental stimulation is best, not physical. Laying in bed doing nothing makes me anxious but doing so while gaming or watching youtube relaxes me. \n\nIs this normal? I literally see exercise everyone where as something i should be doing to help my anxiety but it seems to be counterproductive to the point i have to calm myself down afterwards.",

I try to rationalise, but my mind won’t stop obsessing.\n\nFew minutes later, my heart feels weird, and I mistakenly check my pulse to find out it’s skipping beats. This sends me into a panic, even though deep down I know palpitations are normal. \n\nI convince myself I’m going to go into cardiac arrest, and spend at least an hour in panic checking my pulse constantly, looking up symptoms online etc.. before my body gets too tired and I fall asleep.\n\nWell, I woke up today, and shocker, no I wasn’t having a heart attack or going into cardiac arrest. I felt a bit off this morning thinking about last night, but I’m 100% fine now..\n\nNow I’m thinking, did I literally just jinx myself into an attack? And has this happened to anyone? So annoying.",

Whenever I’m in situations like sitting on a train or being at school, I start feeling like I urgently need to go to the bathroom (either to pee or poop). It feels like I’m seconds away from an accident, and it becomes this overwhelming sensation.\n\nBut then, if I get to a bathroom, I often don’t even have to go at all. It’s frustrating and stressful, especially when I’m in places where a restroom isn’t easily accessible.\n\nFor example, today I even left a lecture, telling my professor I was sick—even though I wasn’t—because I felt so nervous and afraid that I wouldn’t make it to the bathroom in time. I know it was mostly my nerves, but the feeling was so strong that I didn’t know what else to do.\n\nIt really hinders my school because i’m afraid to go too lectures because of this.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it some kind of anxiety response or something else entirely? Any advice or tips would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

Everything becomes too bright and too loud and if I’m in public the panic becomes 100x worse.

Sometimes I just think why to keep going. Or, why can't i just enjoy life?\n\nWhat helps? swimming hard. Swimmers probably know that swimming is not like gym, because you are forced to apnea and crave for air when you do hiit or do long sessions.\n\nI mean, when I swim, the rest of the day is ok. Like the curse has been lifted. unfortunately I can swim only twice a week because of shoulder problems, and pool is only opened in the evenings.\n\nSo here is my question: what could this mean? This knowledge may point to something that may solve my anxiety? maybe I lack some X that could be supplemented another way? what could be that X? what happens when I swim? could I replicate it another way? any doctor, people with knowledge?\n\nThanks",

        "Text": "Hi, I've been on 1.25mgs of Clonazepam (.25 in the morning and 1 in the evening) for a long time, probably close to ten years.\n\nI have wanted to go off it for a long time but have put it off due to fear, not of my anxiety but of the withdrawal symptoms, which I know can be very bad even when you're tapering slowly. Frankly I feel a lot of anger that I was prescribed these drugs in the first place, without understanding what I was getting myself into. I would have made a different choice if I had understood.\n\nMy doctor has never seemed very keen when I've brought up wanting to taper off. During my last appointment, I said I wanted to discuss it seriously and asked how she recommended tapering off. I thought she would suggest switching to Diazepam as I have seen people do when I look this up online, but she basically just told me to take a quarter less of my dose for a few weeks and then reduce again every few weeks until I'm done. She said she has had patients go off this way but they struggle with the anxiety they were prescribed the meds for in the first place (I'm guessing a lot of this anxiety is actually withdrawal.) This sounds like a very fast and loose way to taper to me, does anyone else have any advice? To be clear I'm not asking anyone to make medical decisions for me, but thoughts from people who have gone off Clonazepam before, or have tried, are appreciated.\n\nFor context I am in the US and I don't have health insurance, so that's a factor.",

I've developed an extreme fear of developing schizophrenia or psychoses (and feared of having to be taken in in a mental hospital) because of all my stress. I know that symptoms of psychoses/schizophrenia are hallucinations, hearing voices and believing in complottheories. So I've been checking myself for having these symptoms every day and it's stressing.\n\nSo this happened tonight: my parents were watching a show and when it ended, I saw shortly a commercial of the Dutch mental health care being in a bad state passing by. A woman told something about losing her humanity, I didn't quite get the context but I was afraid it was aimed at the bad health care. My mom told my dad quickly \"I thought we'd watch show X\" in a way I interpreted as if she knew this commercial would potentially trigger me. She kept looking at me to check if I was okay. Then the thoughts I've been so afraid of popped into my head \"what if people in health hospitals don't take care of us but are against us\" and thoughts like \"is my mom part of me too, are they out to get me in a mental hospital\" or thoughts questioning what is reality etc. I got instantly dizzy and nautious of fear and the back of my head tingled and hurt. I have never ever believed in complots like that and have always believed in the mental health system and my loved ones have only the best interest at heart for us all. Please tell me these thoughts are my OCD/anxiety screwing with me. I catch myself having these paranoid thoughts and it's sooo scary!\n\n(I once watched Shutter Island which probably didn't help)",

I've never felt this intense anxiety last for this long - the sort that paralyses you and makes you brain just whirl out of control (literally feeling physically attacked by crazy intrusive abstract thoughts that make absolutely no sense) to the point you're out of breath, you feel like you're moving a million miles per hour but you're literally just frozen, sitting still.

Does anybody have any advice for me on how to get through this? Any rituals or mantras? Films to watch? Podcasts to calm someone in panic mode? Stories? Audiobooks? Meditation and breathing is great but I'm not sure my brain can keep that still right now...but I could try if anyone knows something good. Writing this has calmed me a little...Thanks in advance.

It does spike whenever I talk about family or we have a hard day with the kids (the 2 stresses in my life).\n\nI'm not sure if this is at a level that I need to medicate. I've seen my doctor and he has in the past prescribed me Valdoxen / Agomelatine. I took it for a few months and I swear i did absolutely nothing. I doubled the dose half way and still no change.\n\nThat was a year ago. Yesterday, my doctor prescribed me escitalopram or zoloft. From reading around, these can have side effects such as weight gain and loss of sex drive... Not something I'm keen on.\n\nSo I'm trying to understand at what point does anxiety get where it should be medicated. To me it feels like those side effects are not worth it.\nI wish Valdoxen worked as the side effects sound minimal. Is it worth trying it again? Maybe I didn't take it long enough?\n\nAny advice would be great. Thanks \n\n",

The next thing I know, I'm hacking oddly and the insect is coming out of me. I hate to admit it, but it traumatized me. It shook up my sense of safety in this home we rent.. And .. It's been so hard to get back to where I was.\n\nFor three separate weekends to follow, (save for the third one), occurred not only back to back, but while I was high on edibles. I had this thought I couldn't get out, that something was in my throat that shouldn't be.. And I was coughing a ton, hoping I'd induce vomiting, anything until I felt secure that my throat was clear. My fiance' tried hard to reassure me that I was fine. It was so challenging to calm down, to see he could be right.\n\nThe last ocassion happened just a few days ago. On Monday. Except this time I was sober. And it terrified me that my mind could overwhelm me so much to the point of being terrified of so much.. And I feel in a way to analyse what is driving this fear.. It could be I have lost my sense of security and safety in myself, and in my home.. I already have wanted to build my sense of self.. But this incident really shook me up..\n\nSince all of this happened, I have been .. :\n\nmainly eating soft foods\n\nif I eat more solid like foods, I eat small bites, and chew almost too carefully where I feel I am not enjoying the experience of the food, as we might, and more going through it mechanically.. \n\nI keep making soup to help my throat (but how on Earth is that a lose? Soup is amazing!)\n\nif I am too alone with myself, I start thinking intrusive thoughts over upcoming events: Like when we go home to visit our family for Thanksgiving.. If it's been hard for me to kick the anxious thoughts out .. How will it be for me to socialize? I've had to tamper on that fast before I get too caught up in them..\n\nIn all of me.. Trying hard to be rational with myself, reassure myself I am safe, this home is safe, our neighbourhood is safe, people are super vigilant on the community Facebook groups for the small town I live in .. I'm trying to remind myself this is a trying incident.. It will take me time to get past it.. I WILL get past it. I've had to get past way more troublesome events, issues in my family, and so forth.. \n\nBut it's one thing to say this to myself when I'm distanced greatly from the anxious thoughts.. When I'm feeling kind of close to normal before that incident in October.. When I think I'm finally past it.. and I can go back to how I was.. But then to tell myself this in the throws of the anxiety.. \n\nIt's like swimming in ice cold water to the sunshine paradise island. And you try so hard to swim, but you're drowning.. And you can't reach the sun no matter how hard you move.. \n\nI'm okay right now. I know I am. I can feel it in my body.. My easy rise and fall of breathing. My thoughts telling me I am okay. My fiance' being right outside working on our car.. \n\nI pray it doesn't come back.. \n\nI wonder if anyone else has felt like this before. I wonder how you worked pas through your own traumatic issue. \n\nI pray I find peace sooner than later. \n\nAnd as for that rule \"no reassurance..\" How lame!\n\n",

I've noticed it happens mostly when I walk into a \"new\" space, or I'm outside walking for exercise, or when I am driving.  I recently drastically cut my caffeine intake, and this was little help. I was hoping it would help more than it did, to be honest. \n\nI made a point to really try to pay attention to the times when I feel dizzy.  Today, while walking, I realized I was clenching my teeth and not breathing.  I was listening to an audiobook, but I also had some anxious thoughts running through my head.  Then again it happened when I was driving, and I also wasn't breathing.  I am unintentionally holding my breath.  It's so strange.\n\nHas anyone else ever experienced this?  Do you have any tips to make sure I remember to breathe?  Or, do you have any tips on how to just calm my mind?  \n\nI can NOT afford therapy.  I have no health insurance right now and I am between jobs.  I can't afford insurance through the ACA because I do have some savings, so I can't get a stipend.  \n\nTHANK YOU for any help.",

I haven’t been to a doctor in over approx a decade from now, and I constantly worry about what might happen during an appointment. I often fear that my ears might be infected or something could be wrong (it can also be a wax buildup, which is kinda unlikely because I make sure my ears are clean most of the time, I still kinda fear that though), I've had this fear of doctors for as long as I can remember, and I've always avoided seeking help because of it. It makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed, does anyone else experience this kind of fear or anxiety? And if you’ve seen an ear doctor, what was your experience like? Is there anything I should know when seeing an ear doctor? \n\nAlso, I forgot to mention that I'm gonna be seeing one this Saturday so apologies for mentioning that pretty late.",

I'm exhausted and can barely do anything, except maybe walk a bit, fill the dishwasher and do some stretches. My OCD and anxiety is through the roof and today I have mostly cried, felt hopeless and unsure what to do next.\n\nI'm about to buy a somatic healing course which I hope helps me heal my traumas and unprocessed emotional pains from the past, which I'm pretty sure are the root of my anxieties. I've been having intense anxiety attacks for the last few weeks about losing my mind, disappointing my family, getting psychosis or having to be taken in a mental hospital. For the last three weeks, my head's been burning - the feeling of tinglings in the back of my head, the feeling of an electrical wire around the back/crown of my skull and these sudden sharp sensations on the sides of my head. It's been troubling and tiring me.\n\nThank the lord I've had SOME reasonably okay days and nights last week - even though my dreams have been intense and I wake up several times a night. I take 1 oxazepam calming pill only once a week to help me sleep if it really gets out of hand, that works a but for me. \n\nMy doctor prescribed me citalopram to try and I'm too scared to take it. What if it will make even things worse? And will I be able to have the energy/strength to deal with that? Or what if it represses my feelings and the somatic healing course won't be able to do its job? I'm already talking to a therapist - who redirected me to specialists to have me diagnosed and probably on either schematic therapy or EMDR I guess.\n\nMy relationship is wobbly, my job is wobbly and my mental health is falling apart. I feel like it's just too much for me. But I do want to get out of this state desperately and get my life back, there is so much I want to do and experience in life...\n\nI'm unsure which path to take now. I'm so tired, sad and afraid. I know I can't do nothing, but I don't know what. So some advice or experience would be great <3",

I play sports, go to uni, diet is okay but I don't drink enough water. \n\nI have health anxiety diagnosed but I'm not talking any medications for it. \nI'm a but confused / scared at the moment. \nFor 4 days now I have this fever without any other symptoms other than being slightly sleepy but not something major to stop me from being very active during the day. I have suspected vitamin D deficiency (diagnosed one in February but after that basically I didn't took my prescribed dose cuz in the summer I though I don't need it) and maybe the tiredness is coming from there. \nThe fever is running from 36.8 till 37.7 (mostly in the evening). During the day it stays around 37.2-37.4. \nMy anxious brain of course decided that this is cancer as this is my main fear. I went to a doctor and he did a blood test and everything turned out normal no signs of any bacterial infection and he said the numbers were good. \nYet I have this fever. And now I fear lymphoma. \nMy confusion came after I googled and it scared the s...t out of me that persistent low-grade fever is the first symptom of lymphoma. Buuut.... people in the Reddit forums that I found describe a fever around 37.2.... like you can imagine it was getting more and more horrific for me. \nMy doctor tho told me that 37.2 is normal body temperature. In Google also is described that technically until 37.5 or 38 is not actually a fever. And I'm very confused and scared right now. If 37.2 is normal body temperature and doctors are not concerned about it then why is it a symptom of lymphoma? Is it actually like that or these people (god bless them to be healthy) just had it by coincidence and think it's a symptom. \nMy doctor explained to me that I should be worried if it was above 38.0 but now with everything that I saw in the forums, the fact that I don't have any flu symptoms and just this fever is making me very scared. \nI don't have any itchiness, night sweats, weight loss or lack of appetite (sometimes when I'm stressed tho I have). I can pretty much do everything I walk a lot during the day go to uni and work and I don't have problems with that. I don't have any swollen big lymph nodes. I have only few very small and palpable ones in the groin are but as far as I know these are normal. \nAny thoughts on this? Should I be worried about lymphoma and push it with more tests? Are these the fevers that lymphoma patients have? My doctor suggested it could be viral infection but idk why only fever and no other symptoms? Today my throat is a bit scratchy but nothing more..... Any help will be appreciated.",

Así se resume mi ansiedad y seguro la de muchas otras personas, una frustración por no poder controlar situaciones de la vida.\n\n**La nostalgia provocó mi ansiedad,** recordar los días en los que llegaba de la universidad y en la casa me esperaba mi mamá con algo de comer, que mientras comía le contaba como me había ido y conversabamos de muchas cosas.

Salgo a caminar, veo series, colecciono legos. \n\nVivo desconectado del mundo, he tenido días tranquilos, pero otros muy malos en los que todo lo percibo gris, sin sentido, como si no valieramos nada, sintiendo que todo es prestado, los padres, los hijos, la salud, etc... me siento desesperado y desconsolado...siento tristeza por no poder estar al 100% para mi familia. \n\nGracias por leer.",

I suffered from this in 2021 as well, but back then I didn't have a car and somehow I was forced to walk until I recovered again. And even though I work out at home and theoretically expose myself to the triggering symptoms (like a racing heart) and my body manages to handle exercise very well, when I have to go outside it's like the greatest effort.\n\nNow, most of the journeys I make are by car. If I go to the store, to the mall, with friends, I take the car. It is very difficult for me to return to the old habit of walking. Has anyone been through something similar and has any advice?

I know it's the fear and stress of being too exhausted to successfully interview that's causing me to be too exhausted to successfully interview, but I don't know how to stop it. ",

I’m currently dealing with intense anxiety, and I’ve had anxiety basically my whole life (diagnosed) without getting the help I needed. I can’t function in any way anymore, can barely leave my bed and house, and if I do I have to use all my energy to force myself through it, which makes me really DRAINED. Both the anxiety and exhaustion are ruining every aspect of my life at this point, so I definitely need some kind of help as soon as possible.",

I've been trying my best to push through it and not focus on it but that doesn't seem to alleviate the sensations. The only time I feel somewhat okay is when I'm completely calm and away from the situation thats making me anxious. Has anyone else felt the same? What has helped?

I’m in recovery at the moment, I have phases where anxiety still grabs me hard and I can’t even get out of bed some days but thanks to the help of my amazing therapist and medication I’m getting through it.\n\nI have a fear surrounding food, eating out, being in places I cannot escape e.g restaurants, trains, cars, aeroplanes, small rooms, appointment’s etc.\n\nThese places often induce panic attacks HOWEVER… I’m currently sitting on a plane on my way to Thailand from the UK. A whole 13 hours on a plane. I’ve been sat here for 6 hours so far, and I feel great. \n\nI had quite a few hurdles to overcome, I was anxious about the car journey to the hotel in London, anxious about eating dinner in the hotel, anxious about the transfer to the airport, anxious about eating in the airport, anxious about getting on the plane and eating on the plane. \n\nI did absolutely everything. Yes I felt anxious, and nearly fell into panic at some points but the mindfulness I’ve been practicing has helped me so so much.  I ate what I wanted when and where I wanted and it was all fine. Something I never thought I’d be able to do.\n\nI’ve gotten into the practice of SHOWING my brain that these “fears” are (for lack of a better term) all in my head. Rather than just telling myself “it’s fine, it’ll be okay” I need to show my brain that it’s fine and all these things are perfectly safe. It’s difficult but things have gone so well. I do hope I’m not speaking too soon. \n\nI now have 8 days in Thailand in which I’m celebrating my birthday. I’m so pleased with myself and wanted to share with others that even though you’re struggling right now, this will pass. I’ve had times where I never ever believed that. I thought I’d be stuck in this viscous anxious cycle for the rest of my life. \n\nThank God I now see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTo anyone out there reading this who feels hopeless in the recovery journey of anxiety, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. You’ve got this 💪",

Once we signed i inmediatly regretted it and it unchained this reaction. Well, the same thibg has happened with own new dog. I thought about this new addition to owr family for some time, was very excited about it, bought many things for him etc. But now that he is here it has sparked this ibtense anxiety worse than ever before, i had to take two days off work and had to go to a psych guard where they prescribed rispirodone. Im constantly worried about him, thinking what hell break next (he has only broken very minor things until now) worried of leaving him alone and constantly thinking about him. Im startibg to thibk i should let the shelter know this but my partner is very much against me sayibg something.

Friday morning last week I woke up with a bit of a moderate pain from toothache from one of my bottom molars on the left side, I didn't think much of it took some painkillers but oh boy when I tried sleeping that night I realised this is no joke as the pain became unbearable, throbbing feeling like my heart beat with a bit of a annoying swelling underneath the jaw. After a night of pretty much no sleep I tried ringing 111 hopefully getting an emergency appointment that day but no luck, until Monday when I finally managed to get one booked for Tuesday while in the meantime the pain was so severe and the swelling remained the same. After my appointment the dentist told me l have an abscess, and that I will need to take Amoxicillin 500mg, 3 times a day for 5 days before extraction is possible. That day I started my antibiotics, now my concerns and the reason I am writing, looking for some guidance, are:\n\n1. After 24 hours of taking amoxicillin, being on my 4th dose right now, waiting to take my 5th one when time comes, during those 24 hours, the pain is better, small peaks of pain randomly but bearable. What I am worried about is the fact that the area of my face where tooth is pretty much located has started swelling to the point where you can tell and feel, while during the weekend, Monday and Tuesday was not. Is this normal? Considering I have started the antibiotics over 24 hours ago because after reading online about so much stuff to do with infections, abscess etc I started feeling a bit anxious as I do not wish for this infection to spread.\n\n2. Is the amoxicillin not doing its work properly? I know some bacteria over time have developed an immunity to some antibiotics. This is the first time I take amoxicillin also. I know it's only been 24 hours and that I should just wait and finish the antibiotics first but you know, better making sure earlier rather than later about some of the stuff I'm worried about.\n\nThank you.",

        "Text": "TW: very brief mention of an abusive relationship.\n\nHey folks,\n\nI've struggled to a degree with anxiety, especially social/relationship anxiety, since I was in middle school. Since the end of a long-term relationship last year and the loss of a few friendships connected to that breakup, my relationship anxiety has really spiraled out of control and is starting to take over my life.\n\nTo sum it up: I am constantly looking for evidence that my friends, coworkers, and family hate me. When I leave work or a social event I ruminate for hours over whether or not I did or said something awkward or wrong or that could have hurt someone. At work, I'm scared that I am too slow/that people think I am awkward or stupid, and that I am doing everything wrong. When my friends take a long time to text back I am so scared that it is because I am annoying them or pissing them off. I'm afraid that everyone in my life thinks that I am too much or a burden. I am just paranoid about being a bad friend, child, sister, coworker, etc and the thoughts I have surrounding this are near-constant and painful. \n\nIt rears its head the most in romantic relationships/when I have a crush on someone. I was seeing a guy for about five months earlier this year and entire days would be consumed with anxiously waiting for texts back, trying to figure out if he was talking to other girls, and analyzing his behaviour for hints for reassurance or loss of interest I felt like I was going insane. I think it is relevant to note that the longest (and first) relationship I was in was abusive. Among other things, my ex would freeze me out and not acknowledge my existence for days (and we lived together) until he wanted something from me. Despite being years ago, I think that relationship is still impacting me. I have a crush on my best friend now and that same anxiety is starting to form around him, and I am really scared that I am going to hurt our friendship.\n\nThe funny thing is that I know my friends, coworkers, and family care for me and enjoy my company. I have so much evidence of the love that surrounds me. I've been told by all my managers that I am a very strong employee, old coworkers at past jobs are always excited to see me, and I have great friends and a very close family. I just don't \\*believe\\* any of that evidence. It doesn't stick.\n\nI just want to feel secure in my relationships and in myself.\n\nI am thinking about going to the psych again to talk about this issue specifically. I received a secondary diagnosis for anxiety on top of a primary diagnosis of an ED, so the anxiety was never a priority in my treatment. Now that I am doing better in terms of my ED, I really want to prioritize treating my anxiety. I am also considering medication.  \n\nAnywho, I just needed to vent and for reasons above, felt like I couldn't vent to my loved ones. Thanks for reading!",

Then I had a massive panic attack and afterwords I started struggling a lot with my anxiety basically feeling nervous shaking and out of it all day, so I went back on my citelopram 40mg . I've been on it for over two weeks and have not been feeling much better other than my panic attacks going away. I still feel out of it, obsessing over every illness, and can barely leave the house. Ive been to the ER a couple times for High bp dizziness and panic attacks but I went again recently for feeling out of it still( can barely focus). I just feel so out of it still and my memory sucks. All blood tests and ct scans of chest and head have been normal. Recently in the last couple weeks think it's causing dry mouth as well. When I went to the ER this last time the doctor suggested i switched to Zoloft right away, like taking that tomorrow rather than citelopram. Anybody have any suggestions on how not to feel so disconnected, and is that wise to just switch over to Zoloft instead? I realize the medicine won't fully work right away but I've been on citelopram for over two weeks and it hasn't really done much to make me feel better? It's just been almost three weeks now and I don't feel any significant changes from when I started. Only thing I've noticed recently is dry mouth. I also didn't get the same onset of side effects I would when I'd start on this medicine in the past, as I go on and off. Should I keep at it and see if it makes me feel better with more time? I literally do not feel better whatsoever other than my panic attacks stopped. It's hard to navigate daily life because I feel so out of it ",

This idea of being \"schizophrenic\" was influenced in me through social media– I had no idea what schizophrenia was, however now that I've been informed of this terrifying condition, I've now subconsciously(?) began drawing conclusions of different reasons why I could be. No evidence of the outside world has provided that this is to be true, yet my anxiety tricks me to find reasons as to why it might be. It was a gradual process, I slowly began to make connections to the possibility more and more over the course of about a year. It seems so silly in hindsight, like I said, logically I knew it not to be the case; yet the emotional trigger was so strong its almost compulsive to make the jump.

Me and my roommate who’s also in the group went to visit some other friends (These are highschool friends btw I’ve had a pretty good relationship with them for like 3 years up until this event). \n\nWhile we were sitting in the guys dorm, they all looked at me and started confronting me about lying about vaping, which I definitely had hidden from them for a bit because I was embarrassed about not being able to quit. I understand lying about it was the wrong thing to do, but their reaction really surprised me. It felt really hostile to me, so I said “I don’t understand why you guys are making such a big deal out of this”. \n\nEveryone went silent. They immediately started a new conversation and for the rest of the time I was with them I felt super fucking on edge about everything. On top of this, one of them straight up said they didn’t want to be my friend anymore, but in a really joking manner (he replaced song lyrics about hating someone with my name). No one said anything at all after this, no one questioned what he said, some of them just were glancing at me to see how I reacted.\n\nSince then, I’ve been really closed off for the most part with them. I’m still vaping, but planning to quit someday soon and I’m very determined I can do it. I kinda feel like I’m forcing myself to stay with the group, even though my mind is always telling me they just hate me deep down. They’re constantly just making jokes about me ‘crashing out’ and generally just insults.\n\nIm really trying to be cool with everyone again, but I can’t hold my own in a conversation at all and usually just can’t think of anything to say to them. I can be funny with them, but our conversations always just end up back at silence or jokes about me.\n\nIt’s literally mental torture at this point.

Now, once puberty rolled around, when I was 19 (21 M), things kicked into a state of constant anxiety that just kinda didn’t leave for the better half of a year, and this was when I thought things were getting better.\n\nAnyway, my some of my extended family (along with some brothers and sisters) went on a trip to Disney world. Knowing my anxiety history, I at first just decided not to even plan to go, but through encouragement I finally decided to take a swing at it. \n\nThe anxiety was some of the worst for the whole week. And you know how it is: panic, scared to eat, scared to not eat, hyperventilating, feeling tired and wigged out; I even scratched my neck so much as a tic that my auntie told me to stop before I drew blood. It was bad.\n\nNow fast forward, puberty and hormones seem to have evened out a bit, and I faced a lot of fears in terms of doing new things without too much debilitating anxiety. Thank God for His help, and for perhaps moving my body development along so that it can handle stress more.\n\nThe question I have is this, and I’m sorry for going on, but, Disney still haunts me. I regret being so anxious and not participating in so much rides and unable to have fun and coping non-stop. It’s been two years and that trip still hurts to think about. I want to try again and have closure, but it still freaks me out that what if, just what if I can’t handle it again, or the memories flood too much, and then it’ll be terrible again… I want to try again and do what I missed out on, but the memory of just, how IRRITATED I am at the anxiety and the NO APPARENT REASON of it just cripples me.\n\nI’m scared.

But it just takes some encounter with someone who is doing better than me to take it all away. For my mind to crawl back into its familiar territory if blaming me to do a better job. Guilt for not being successful (whatever that means), not earning a lot of money. Idk. Whenever I achieve the peace of being enough, it is fleeting. \n\nIt is not that I am a failure. In fact, a lot of people would think of me as that \"successful person\". And yet, knowing this, knowing that joy lies in the little things, my mind forgets it. Time and again. I can't hold on to that realisation that my happiness and mental peace matters more than fame or money or anything else. \n\nAnybody else experience this? How do you manage these emotions? ",

I constantly feel this tension in my upper abdomen, almost like a sense of agitation or a bubble of air that extends up to my throat. I just went for a 1.5-hour walk in the cold, then sat outside my building for another 20 minutes. While sitting there, feeling cold made me feel a bit better, but overall, I just can’t keep living like this. Only for the first hour after waking up do I not feel this. I feel like no one understands what this is; I haven’t met anyone who’s had anything similar.\n\nI miss the feeling of NEUTRALITY. I feel like crying from it, but I can’t even bring myself to cry. It’s a physical-psychological feeling, but it mostly bothers me physically. Distracting my mind doesn’t help, and keeping my body busy doesn’t help either. I don’t know what this is, but I’m exhausted from it to the point that I’m wondering if I’ve somehow imagined it.\n\nIt’s not anxiety, because I can tell the difference. Often it even makes me feel nauseous. I feel a little better after drinking an energy drink. I just can’t go on like this. I had a period of calm for a few months, but it’s come back again, lasting another week, and I’m so incredibly tired of it. I can’t even properly describe it.",

I have had insomnia and poor sleep for almost a month and have been going to bed at 4am mostly. (and I am writing this at 4am right now). I told the doctor I am experiencing really awful intrusive thoughts when trying to sleep which keeps me awake for hours, unable to stop thinking about them. My doctor said he could prescribe me the medication and it would help reduce the amount of intrusive thoughts I have and hopefully alleviate some symptoms. today i took two pills, one at around 7pm, and one half an hour or so at half 3 in the morning. I am writing this unable to sleep because my intrusive thoughts are more vivid and detailed and i don't know what to do. does propranolol actually help with intrusive thoughts? My main problems with sleeping are the fact that I'm too anxious to start going to sleep, partially because that means I'll have to wake up the next day, and partially because actually trying to get to sleep is difficult and I usually get anxiety attacks at night due to the types of thoughts I am having. I haven't been on the medication long enough to give a proper review of them but I can definitely say that for me my intrusive thoughts have been worse tonight than previously when I was not on the medication.\nwhat should I do? how do I stop these intense intrusive thoughts? I can't even tell people what they're about because they feel so graphic and realistic. I feel so lost and like I can't be helped. I have a therapist, I have medication, I want to sleep, but I can't.

And as of recently, I developed a fear of men. I can't be around them for long without being anxious, being in school I have no choice. Before I recognized that the stuff that happened to me was not just a part of life, I never had a fear of men.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is if anyone is so afraid of something from their past happening again that they completely avoid situations where there is a possibility that the situation could happen again (ex: avoiding talking to people in fear of being bullied or not adding men on any social media in fear they may do something even if they are harmless) \n\nEven with things that have never happened to me or probably never will happen to me I will constantly be fearful of and will even develop phobias if it gets to a certain point. \n\nIs this normal for general anxiety? Does anyone else experience this? \n\nI'm sorry if it's not very clear or didn't make sense, I'm not a good writer when comes to asking things online 🙁 \n\nThanks for letting me share. ",

I tried Effexor and it made my health stuff worse so I didn’t do it long.

We try to text or chat on the phone every other day for a bit. In the meantime, I find myself stressing mainly about the weekends alone. I don't have many friends in the state I live in now (we moved recently) and tbh I am very much a homebody and introvert even when he's around and home. I have a big dog and we are living in a small house. My routine is very set during the week which keeps the anxiety at bay/makes it manageable. Wake up early. Go to work. On lunch drive home let dog out to potty, go back to work, go to gym make dinner bathe and sleep. The week days go by very fast. It's those weekends. The quiet in the home. The \"now what\" feeling when I wake up. Too much time on my hands makes my mind wander and anxiety flare and I start to worry, like, is he ok? Is he alive? What's he doing? When will he come home?

That because the mind is so powerful that it can create physical symptoms, I was just thinking them into existence and therefore making it all up. My labs kept coming back normal. My heart tests were good too (but my GP would like them to redo my monitor). My X-rays showed nothing. But on my last appointment, I told her a weird symptom that I thought she would for sure dismiss. It’s ok if you ask what it was. She sent in for one more test and it came back positive for an autoimmune disorder but not which specifically. Now I am going to see a specialist and look further. \n\nThis is the first doctor I’ve had that made me feel comfortable telling her all those little weird things. Most write it off as anxiety and dismiss. I feel so validated and so excited to move forward. I know not having a chronic health condition would be the best, but I am so happy to maybe finally figure it out and start taking steps to aid and prevent future issues. \n\nI’m just sharing this because it feels like a win over something that has caused me so much anxiety and like I said, made me feel crazy! I really need to learn how to start trusting myself again because I’ve completely stopped. Maybe I’ll feel better once I figure that out a little bit I\n",

        "Text": "I've had anxiety since like middle school. It used to be a lot more impactful in my life (could not make phone calls or order at a restaurant), but I've been \"doing it scared\" for a while and really improved, which is great. I don't experience what I would confidently characterize as panic attacks - I get nausea, fast heart rate, sweating, and tremors when I'm in certain situations that trigger anxiety, but I look outwardly normal unless you know me fairly well.\n\nToday I got prescribed propranolol for as-needed use, for those predictable times of heightened anxiety. That's something I'm really happy with and think will definitely benefit me. I was also offered to look into paroxetine to manage my baseline level of anxiety if I want to.\n\nIf it were a magical drug with no side effects and adjustment period, I'd take it. I know the anxiety I experience in my day-to-day isn't normal even though I manage it well and function mostly normally. I wish I could experience a life not limited by anxiety. I always feel held back by a constant nagging sense of self-consciousness and shame, and it makes social situations I feel like I should be gung ho about difficult to navigate. It feels like every conversation is a series of quick-time events lol, and group gatherings have me hanging back in a corner, nervous, waiting for someone to talk to me, not knowing what to do with myself, and thinking I probably look like an idiot. I want to feel free from that.\n\nBuuuut it's not a magical drug with no side effects and adjustment period. I'm not sure I want to face a couple months of increased nausea and anxiety just to find out it doesn't help me very much or that it isn't a magic fix and the anxiety I have can only be solved by working through it. And I'm not sure weight gain and decreased sex drive (which... mine is practically none already, so I really don't want to see what's left obliterated) is worth it either. I'm also hesitant about the idea of becoming dependent on an SSRI I have to take every day and experiencing withdrawal if I don't feel like it's helping. It's a pretty big six month commitment for not being sure I'm anxious enough to warrant it, you know?\n\nI really appreciate any perspectives you can share. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n\ntl;dr My baseline anxiety levels don't interfere in my life very much. Do you think paroxetine would be worth the trial period, commitment, and side effects?",

Go SLOW. Slow as you need. For me, a 10% taper was too fast most of the time. And I had to get down to .04mg before I could get off.

After she passed, I joined college and got into a relationship. But soon, I realized that I couldn’t focus on my studies the way I used to. I was an excellent student before all of this happened, but college brought a lot of challenges, and I found myself losing focus. I don’t know if it’s due to anxiety or something else, but gradually, things started to get worse. My grades dropped, my confidence hit an all-time low, and I began to feel unintelligent. My conversations became more negative, and I started experiencing severe mood swings.\n\nIn 2024, my girlfriend broke up with me. She never gave a clear reason, but I’m pretty sure it was because of my negativity. Now, my grades are low, I’m dealing with the loss of someone important, and I still carry that guilt. It’s like I can’t grasp whatever I’m studying anymore, and focusing has become nearly impossible. The breakup hurt me a lot, as I was very serious about the relationship.

Then on Thursday I cut my nicotine Intake from almost a pack a day (20 ciggs) to 6 a day.  Saturday night i felt like I couldn't breathe randomly and the panic attack got so bad I thought something else had to be wrong.  Called 911 for the first time in my life.  The emts said my lungs sounded great, my heart was fine, i was at 100% blood oxygen and that it was for sure a panic attack.  They told me to go to an urgent care the next day to get an xray on my lungs and do some tests.  We found an emergency room that could do way more tests that has a program for uninsured so it keeps the bill down. But before we went I had a virtual visit with my psyc who upped my lexapro from 15mg to 20mg and prescribed propenalol(sp?) For emergencies.  Next, at the ER, They checked everything and again, everything is fine unfortunately.  Gave me some lorazepam to take that night so I could get some sleep, and a script for 15 0.5 mg for sleep and emergencies. \nSince the panic attack, my sleep has been horrible.  The first two nights I woke up in cold sweats(was told likely from nicotine withdrawal) and my anxiety has been near a 10 at least once per day to the point I need to go to my cold bedroom and calm down.  \n\nAfter a really bad panic attack how long did it take yall to feel normal again?  \nHow long has it taken yall to feel the effects of increased dosage on an ssri?\n\nSorry for the super long post just wanted to include a lot of details.",

If you check my previous post, you’d know that I was having trouble sleeping because it felt like my body would pulse any time I’d lie still and I didn’t like the feeling. I thought it might have been related to an energy drink I got for free at the gym (it’s called free rein), and it had 300 mg of caffeine. I’m usually used to only about 110 mg. \n\nAnyway, I couldn’t sleep or eat for 24 hours because of this. I finally got some sleep last night after taking a vitamin d pill (and 2 benadryls to try to knock me out). Idk if the vitamin d pill or just the caffeine finally passing through my body helped but I did stop feeling that pulse feeling. \n\nI don’t feel the buzzing anymore, but I am still nervous to feel it, which I’m sure is only increasing the chance of me feeling it. I’ve been nervous about it all day, which is showing up as like an icy-like feeling through my chest.\n\nLong mf story short I’m tired of losing it. How do you guys suggest I’d deal with this? I already contacted my psychiatrist but they won’t be able to get back to me until tomorrow and I still need to sleep tonight. \n\n(More background: I do have OCD and depression, am nervous about a big exam in 5 days, school registration, just life in general. I’m sure it might’ve contributed, but mainly I think it was that devilish drink.) \n\nIf you made it this far into my post, thank you so much for reading. I also think the past election may have affecting me. Bro IDK i’m TIRED of this and just want to go back to sleeping NORMALLY!\n\nThank you <3",

The past year was the worst one yet, went through several things that made it worse. For information I have social anxiety with agoraphobia. I have anxiety for getting anxietysymptoms in social settings. My worst fear and biggest problem is that I feel like im going to pass out. I get dizzy, numb in my hands and feet, hear drumlike sounds in my ears and see dots everywhere (just like im about to pass out). I am now in contact with therapists and next week I have this big 4-day-treatment that will be exposure therapy with others that struggle too. \nAnyways, I dont feel like exposure therapy helps. The more bad experiences I get with a situation, the more anxiety it gives me. I can have 99 good experiences with a certain task or situation, but the 1 time I get a bad experience it will ruin things for me. So im afraid that this exposure therapy will make me worse. That I get a bad experience in a situation that I didn’t before and ruin that situation for me. For example if they make me go to a store and I get a panicattack, I will be afraid of going to all stores. About a yr ago I had a really bad panic attack while driving and now I dont want to drive anymore. Two years ago I had a panic attack while introdusing myself in front of a group of people, and now I can’t even say my name in groups hahah.. I just realized that this may be my anxiety talking, but can you pls share your experiences woth exposure therapy, thank you<3",

I don't really know how to put it into words as I've never really talked about it out loud but I kind of plead for everything to be okay? lmao     Like for example every night I say things like \"Please let everything and everyone be okay, (insert names) please or please don't let this certain bad thing happen\" ya know stuff like that. I used to believe that if I didn't say these that things would go badly, In the past year or so I think I've been getting better at realizing that that is not how it works but also if I forget to say those things then I do panic so maybe not. D: I also find myself doing it randomly during the day whenever I get a chance to think about something not so great. I don't even know who I'm asking to please not let it happen but I started doing it a few years ago when some not so great things started to happen with a person close to Me's health. Things aren't as bad now but I feel like I'm still in constant panic about things.  I don't have like physical panic attacks with a racing heart or anything like that unless something big happens so I don't know. Can you still have a form of anxiety without them?  I guess most of the things I worry about are valid, like peoples health, nothing bad happening and stuff but is it normal to worry about them for what feels like all the time? I'm horrible at explaining things so I don't even know if this makes sense. Another thing I've never told anyone is that when all the things with this persons health was going on I convinced myself that if I did anything \"Bad\" (like bad behavior) that bad things were going to happen. I was between the ages of like 14-16 during this time but not sure if that matters. I do think it had a a lot to do with how I turned out behavior wise because my siblings are completely different in behavior compared to me, love them though.

        "Text": "If anyone has any tips on managing this, it would be greatly appreciated. I have already been evaluated by a doctor and am coming to a cross roads.  \n  \nI've had a degree of anxiety my entire life but recently things have gotten out of control and I don't know why. For the past two months I have been overwhelmed with anxiety and panic attacks everyday. It doesn't end. There is nothing pressing on my mind that is causing this, as my life is the best that is has ever been. I am not depressed, have a great support network, good job, nice residence etc. but everyday I am randomly breaking into panic and am unable to be myself because I am so tense.\n\nI have been seeing a therapist that I love on and off for several years now and he has never seen me like this either. I've had bouts of high anxiety and panic for at most a few days in the past, but these were a result of excessive alcohol consumption. I have no problem being sober, though in the past I definitely used alcohol as form of self medication for my anxiety before I knew I actually had anxiety. Ever since this recent episode started happening, I have been completely sober for almost two months now, but things are not getting better. I try to exercise daily but nothing seems to help. I have never experienced anxiety this bad in my 28 years of life.  \n  \nThings have gotten so bad that I went to the doctor for the first time in my life and was prescribed medication to treat the symptoms: Hydroxyzine - an antihistamine to make me sleepy, and Propranolol - a beta blocker that blocks adrenaline. These medications are to be taken as needed but I need them everyday to function and even then, I still have severe anxiety while on the medication. My doctor says that if I continue to need these everyday, SSRIs are the only option. I really don't want to be on SSRIs but i don't know what to do to make this all stop. The anxiety/panic has put severe strain on my newfound relationship  and is impacting every part of my life. I cant even drink a coffee without breaking into a panic. I cant drive without breaking into a panic. My palms and feet and constantly sweating. My body is stuck in fight or flight mode.\n\nAgain, i don't know why this is happening. If anyone has any tips for managing this, it would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Text": "I have been going through a tough phase and have been experiencing insomnia for past few months. So my parents took me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressants, clonazepam and omega 3 meds for 20 days. But within a week of being on these meds I felt very unfocused and couldn’t concentrate on work. Basically I took 0.5 mg for 8 days and decided to take 0.25 mg on 9th day. So the next day after I took 0.25 mg I had a submission deadline. And I found myself very dizzy and unfocused. So I got really anxious and decided to stop the meds totally. Because I felt really unnatural and not at all myself while being on these meds. So after 9th day I have totally stopped the antidepressants and clonazepam. I was worried about withdrawals but I still decided to go ahead and stop completely as I didn’t want to get addicted to it by taking it even for one more day. \n\nIt’s been 4-5 days and I didn’t experience any major withdrawal symptom. But today before I went to bed sometime ago, I started to feel like my heart started racing really fast, like it would explode. I felt really uncomfortable and felt like screaming with my full capacity. I also felt nauseated when I was on the peak of this experience. This may be the first time I have felt this level of panic attack without any reason. For the first time I have felt and seen what a real panic attack feels like. I am not sure if it’s a panic attack or not but it did feel like one. This later turned into me continuously crying for like half an hour to an hour I guess. After which I slowly started feeling better. Although my heart is still beating faster than normal.\n\nNow I am worried about future withdrawal symptoms. How often can I experience such episodes and how long in total this withdrawal period can last. Till what point or time in future I might feel the last withdrawal symptom. Please help me I am really worried. \n\nI want to focus on my job search but the uncertainty of the future risks related to withdrawal is making me anxious. I would really appreciate some clarity on the possible future risks if any so I can be prepared. Thanks in advance.",

        "Text": "Im a 21 year old male. I got anxiety at 18 from drugs. Anxiety to me is not that scary but what freaks me out the most is how we don’t control our brain/body as much as we think we do. I always think, what if my brain just decides to make me go crazy? What if my brain decides to make me go schizophrenic just because i am thinking about it?\n\nI was doing fine just a few months ago, until my gfs nephew had a real bad seizure. His mom was yelling and i ran downstairs and i saw him limp. That triggered so much things inside of my brain. (The nephew made a full recovery) Now ever since that day, all i think about is how our body can just fight us at any giving moment. And that is where my current anxiety is stemming from. Health Anxiety better known as Hypochondria, i have severe health anxiety now. If my breathing starts sounding weird i start thinking about my lungs failing. If my head just hurts out of nowhere, i start thinking about a tumor. \n\nI do get over my anxiety/panic attacks before they start getting worse, i realize i’m breathing heavy and hard so i think to myself, “If something was going on, you wouldn’t have the same feeling as a panic attack, You wouldn’t breathe heavy it would just happen.” Once i start breathing heavy i know it’s just a panic attack AND IM IN CONTROL of that panic attack. Keep thinking about the panic attack and it’s going to get worse. And i know some will say, “all i can do is think of it” I totally understand that, but you can switch your brain to think of something else. Start breathing through your nose, breath in through you nose and hold it for 10 seconds, and let it out through your nose. My anxiety comes back due to tragic events and it stays for a few months. I slowly feel my anxiety leaving again and i’m going to be back to normal. Well anxiety really never leaves but i’m starting to control my body again.\n\n\nThat is my experience with anxiety, if anyone has any questions feel free to comment. \n\n",

I can't pinpoint where it began but it was somewhere during my extreme anxiety episode in 2023, where I thought I was both dying and going crazy for around 10 months. For a while I've not enjoyed and sometimes putting off eating because of this sensation I get in my throat when I do. I can feel the food and it feels stuck. I don't know if it is though, and I might just be hyperaware. I feel like I eat and swallow so manually. Everything I eat is followed by like 3 glasses of water to get rid of this sensation. During all the hospital visits and stuff that happened because of my breathing problem last year (anxiety), I had a whole endoscopy and I WAS diagnosed with a schatzki ring (narrowing of the lower esophagus) however it was described as non-obstructive. Honestly I feel since that diagnosis the feeling has got a bit worse because the idea that I have it is just stuck in my head when I eat. I honestly don't think there's a massive chance this is medical because previously I've spent months on end researching why I couldn't breathe when it was anxiety. It's just something I deal with 100% of the time I eat and it's pretty miserable. Wanted to know if anyone else has had this experience.",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "TL;DR: (I’m in NJ, for reference in case that’s relevant) On my dad’s health insurance policy for years (as a dependent) that he gets through his big union job. Started vaping a few months ago; am in a group therapy program that drug tests patients and might need to go to a doctor due to health concerns as a result of side effects from a medication. Paranoid that a urine or blood test would test positive for nicotine/cotinine or that I’d be asked if I vape, my insurance would find out, and that I’d either have claims rejected, be dropped completely, or be thrown in prison/taken to court. Everyone I talk to (including people from four different subreddits, including the health insurance sub) says I’ll be fine, but everything I’ve read from Google has made me feel otherwise. Feeling suicidal about this. What in the everloving fuck do I *do?* \n\nThe details:\n\nSo here’s some backstory (lots of text incoming)\n\nI started vaping nicotine several months ago. I also haven’t been to the doctor, besides a psych doctor, in a long time. I’m on my father’s health insurance as a dependent until I’m 26. I’m an adult and of legal age to vape.\n\nI wasn’t sure if my dad listed me as a non-smoker on his plan (I was assuming he did because if it renews at the start of every year, I wasn’t vaping last year). He said however that his insurance never even asked about a dependent smoking/vaping, so I’m confused and concerned (which I’ll go into later). \n\nI started group therapy this week for my severe OCD and anxiety issues that have, for the most part, rendered me unable to do most things due to paranoia and running thoughts (if you know, you know).\n\nI was told that all patients of the group therapy mental health program are to be periodically drug tested; I was told this drug test would be urine-based; according to one of the program coordinators, the test is to look for “any other drugs we may not know about, and to make sure that you’re consistently taking your prescribed medications”. I told them I occasionally drink alcohol (haven’t in a few weeks) and that I used to smoke a lot of cannabis but that I stopped last year. I told my therapist I vape, but due to HIPAA, it’s doctor-patient confidentiality.\n\nLikewise, I recently started taking a new antidepressant that I believe has been messing with my menstrual cycle (TMI, but whatever) so if I schedule an appointment with an OBGYN or PCP (of which I have neither), they’re going to ask if I smoke or vape and I’m going to have to tell the truth.\n\nI asked a friend of mine who was in the program before me if they tested for nicotine, and she said “no, they don’t test for nicotine” but when I asked her what they *do* test for, she said “I actually don’t remember what they test for” so I don’t think I can trust her judgment. \n\nI asked my dad if he had me listed as a smoker or non-smoker, and he said “I don’t have you listed as anything; they only ask those questions for life insurance, not medical; you’re only listed as a dependent”. However, all the sources I’ve been obsessively reading online on both Google and Reddit say that most insurances ask the smoker question about both the policy holder *and* their dependent(s) upon applying. So once again, I feel like I can’t trust what he’s saying. I’ve never taken a look at what the plan asks cuz he fills/filled it out himself. I’ve been on his plan for years and it covers pretty much all of my medical expenses. I’m pretty sure he gets the insurance through his job. I asked him again today if he was *totally sure* and he just said “they don’t ask; most of my coworkers smoke; it isn’t like life insurance”. I don’t know what to believe. \n\nMy mom likewise told me that I’ll be fine and that nothing bad is gonna happen and that I’m “sabotaging my mind” by ruminating on these thoughts. It’s been on my mind for over a week. Out of paranoia I stopped vaping a few hours ago, even though I’m 100% sure that if they test me for nicotine within the next week that I’ll test positive for either nicotine or cotinine, depending on what/if they test for that. When it tests positive I feel like they’ll inform my insurance of the results, and that my insurance will think I’ve been hiding this from them. If I go to an OBGYN and they ask if I vape, I can’t lie cuz I’m sure they’d find out somehow. Likewise, lying to insurance is a felony, and I’m terrified of potentially going to prison, to the point that everytime I think about it, I start crying and having suicidal thoughts.\n\nI told my therapist and program coordinators yesterday about my nicotine use, as well as the other adults in my therapy groups, and everyone has either said “that’s a bitttt of a stretch” or “that’s just needed for life insurance” in regards to my worries. Either way, I feel trapped and like there’s nothing that can be done. I’ll get the urine toxicology test at therapy and/or my blood tested at the doctor; it could test positive for nicotine/cotinine, my insurance could deny my claims, drop me from my dad’s insurance, or potentially put me behind bars. \n\nI never intend to withhold information; I only found out recently that this is a thing. I never mean to lie and would never want anyone to think that I’d be willingly doing something bad. I mean, I didn’t even fill out the form!\n\nAt this point I’ve talked to dozens of people about it and they all are saying I’ll be fine, but I already feel super paranoid. I’m tempted to just cancel group therapy altogether, but I know that I need it because I’m really struggling. I feel like if I drop out of the program that my OCD will get worse and I’ll end up ending my life soon, because it’s starting to become unbearable. However, if something bad does potentially come out of this, I’m going to end my life anyway, because I’d rather kms than have a potential criminal record. \n\nI don’t know what to do or how to cope. I’m continuing to spiral. If you have any knowledge or advice *please* help me. \n\n(For reference, I live in New Jersey if that helps for any context).\n",

I just mostly felt sleepy. My shoulders and neck feel a lot less tense, but yesterday and today I didn't even feel the need to take another dose (which is great cause I don't want to take anything like I said lol)\n\nI googled how long it lasts in your system and read maximum of 8 hours for the effects to wear off, but even two days after taking the .5mg my body still feels much calmer than normal.

Maybe a little dizzy but not really?It’s hard to explain. \n\nCan’t forget about feeling restless and feeling this wave that takes over you, leading to a fast heartbeat and shakiness. \n\nWhat are yours and do you have any similar to mine?",

Mine id get thoughts that are constant. everyday it would be whatever thought it Is until something else happens and it transfers into something else. if I get told something my OCD constantly replays it and replays it. now im 18 and yes I still have this issue aswell as anxiety. I recently developed panic attacks because once again I ate something and had an allergic reaction to it. and my OCD has gotten worse since that aswell. My doctor said my vitamin D levels could be the problem since they are horribly low but now I take meds for it. Im just so confused on why a single food can cause this much issues. unless its not food and its just me?\n\nEDIT: I also recently discovered back tension. sortve like something is on my back or in it if that makes sense?\n\ncan someone explain?",

I go to therapy and I'm talking about the things that are making me anxious there. But in general life I'm struggling with not shutting down.

        "Text": "I’ve been dealing with tonsil stones for several years, and it’s really impacting my quality of life. One of the hardest parts is feeling like I have to avoid relationships because I’m constantly worried about bad breath. I’ve tried everything I can think of—diluted 3% hydrogen peroxide (which helps temporarily), gargling with salt water, vinegar, avoiding dairy, taking vitamins (K2D3 and K2 alone), oral probiotics, and keeping excellent dental hygiene. But nothing has worked long-term.  \nIn these past three years, I’ve scoured the internet and haven’t come across a single person who’s solved this problem long-term without surgery. I’ve also seen multiple doctors, but they didn’t have any better solutions other than rinsing with sage and hydrogen peroxide.  \nTomorrow, I’m going to schedule surgery to remove my tonsils, and I’m really anxious about it. The idea of general anesthesia scares me to the core, especially since I’m naturally anxious. Where I live, the procedure requires that I arrive at the hospital 36 hours before the surgery, and I’m worried that my anxiety will get so bad I’ll want to leave before it even happens.  \nI’ve never had any kind of surgery before, so the thought of lying down and letting someone put me to sleep is overwhelming. At the same time, I desperately want to resolve this issue so I can live without constantly worrying about my breath. Has anyone here gone through something similar? How did you manage the anxiety? Any tips on staying calm and prepared for the hospital stay would mean a lot to me. Thank you so much in advance!",

While I haven't hurt anyone, my actions are haunting me badly. As a result, I viewed myself as a subhuman creature, and sometimes I couldn't eat, sleep, or do anything to distract myself. I'd have panic attacks (constantly sweating, pain in my chest, and shortness of breath) and even had multiple emotional meltdowns (a month ago, I cried for the first time since I was 12 years old). I don’t want to kms because I feel like I have so much to live for but at the same time if the general society thinks what i did was beyond redeemable then that might push me to off myself.

My first pet unexpectedly died at a very young age (5 months). I was a wreck, was not behaving like myself, and this almost cost me my personal relationships and friendships.\n\nI then adopted a stray who was diagnosed with canine distemper and unfortunately passed shortly after.\n\nI now own two dogs, and currently, one of them has started coughing suddenly. I took him to the vet, and blood tests are showing signs of a parasitic disease, so we made a second appointment tomorrow to get additional tests done.\n\nEver since receiving the phone call about the results, I have been spiraling. I’ve already had two panic attacks; I always think of the worst and have gone through all of the articles on every search about parasitic diseases in dogs.\n\nEveryone’s advice is the same: to not worry too early, that I am overreacting, etc., but I seriously cannot help it. The only way for me is to constantly seek distractions; otherwise, I have full breakdowns at the thought of my pet being diagnosed with something serious.\n\nI am tired of feeling this way every single time they have even a minor issue. Anyone who has the same experience, can you please tell me how you cope with this tremendous anxiety? I’ve sworn that I will no longer adopt any more dogs after these two because I feel like my health is deteriorating because of them. ",

She was sad because she was the only single one in my group of friends. The problem is that every time I did something with my boyfriend, there were complaints and complaints. I was with him and she ALWAYS sent me messages, super angry with life. Every time we went out to party, it was an argument. Because she got super rude and violent. Maybe I didn't have the maturity to handle it back then. The fact is that the situation began to wear me down. In the end, to avoid conflicts, I did what she wanted. If one day I didn't want to go out to party, she got angry. I lived in another city and every weekend I went to our town to see her. But her boyfriend lives somewhere else, so I spent the day going from one place to another. She always complained that she was bored with our friends and she hammered me over and over again with the same thing. I found it exhausting.  That was combined with my low self-esteem, so I took everything she told me personally. If she complained about my friends, but I was comfortable with them or simply had more tolerance, I felt bad. In short, a very, very tiring frustration of hers was combined with my low self-esteem. So the dynamic was translated into calling her by phone always just to worry about her, to make plans to please her. But, due to this low self-esteem that has nothing to do with her, I never proposed things, for fear of rejection. The fact is that for a year her life changed, she moved, she has new friends and she is happy. Therefore, she does not complain to me as much anymore, which makes me happy. But when that changed, we do not have as much of a relationship. I was like a handkerchief of tears. She also told me the good things, but I did not tell her, because I felt her frustration Completely incapable of telling her about good my day to day. I felt bad about myself and judged. And today, we no longer call each other. I feel that the relationship is strained and I do not know how to solve it.  She is also very \"family-oriented\" and is frustrated that she doesn't know my boyfriend better. But they live in different cities, and they are not going to like each other. They are very different. And knowing that she is not going to like my boyfriend, I feel overwhelmed. I don't know how to make the relationship work and have a normal bond. ",

What I thought was going to be a fun casual game where I’d shell out 50 dollars for fun ended up with me “needling” (making fun of) people I beat, and earning money back which just added to my inherent guilt. I talked to the guy I upset most and resolved everything (because I’m good at diffusing) but also it just sucks knowing I upset someone again. Roped some other friends into it and now I’ll be worrying about whether these guys are mad at me for a month or two…\n\nUniversity is the worst. I’m apart of 15-person music ensemble of which I have a reputation for being hard-working but unreliable.

My ex girlfriend’s joining the group soon as well, even though we’re on good terms, I just know I’m going to have a miserable time for the next few years, but I have to persevere because I can’t disappoint my parents.

Knowing you’re an unstable wreck that craves romantic and social connection, but you want nothing more than to disconnect and rethink your life strategy to overcoming this hell of a mental disease. The unrivalled empathy for others, I always can see from their perspective, when I’m upset all I need is a sorry, but I never get it. This is just a small part of what whirls through my mind every single minute. I look through other posts on this subreddit and everyone else seems like they have it worse, but the other threads seem to external, like not leaving the house or being afraid of certain things. My life just goes forward and I seem to have it all together, but the inner chaos is just so loud and I don’t see anyone else talking about it. Does anyone understand this? Completely and utterly internalised social anxiety? \n\nI just wish it would all go away, and my mind could be at peace for once. \n\n",

        "Text": "Hey guys… so lately I’ve been increasingly aware of just how susceptible I am to isolation and loneliness, and the extent to which I’m like… right on the brink of pretty intense anxiety as a result of it.  \n\nI just became particularly aware of it tonight; when my roommate was out until around 7pm and I was all alone while it was very windy and spooky.  I live at around 9000 feet altitude in Colorado, on about an acre and a half of land - so it’s fairly isolated and you don’t really see or hear the neighbors unless you try.  And we do have 5 cats up here which definitely helps, but when you’re all alone up here, it can feel VERY lonely.  \n\nNow, I’ve been all alone here in the past plenty of times before in the last 4 years while I’ve lived here, but the big difference is that my mother passed away about 6 weeks ago of cancer, and she was…. Really important and special to me, and the person I called when I felt lonely or anxious who would always make me feel better.  So in the past when my roommate was gone, I could just call my mother - or even just text with her - and immediately feel way less alone, way less anxious, way less isolated.  Now she’s gone, and when the wind is howling and I’m all alone up here, I feel TRULY all alone, and a little scared.  And I don’t really have anyone I can turn to - at least nobody I know will always answer and always be there for me, and be kind and comforting.  \n\nAnyway, I guess the good thing is that I’m mostly quite emotionally self-sufficient, and it’s rare I feel truly alone and distressed.  It just brightened me a bit how alone I felt; and how relieved I was when my roommate did come home.  ",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "So about 4 years ago I was diagnosed with a shellfish allergy. It was my second allergy test (the first one was negative.\n\nI had eaten shrimp and other shellfish all my life, and approximately 4 times over the course of 15 years, I ended up getting hives, flushed, and once I started wheezing a bit. Every time it was cleared up with regular allergy pills.\n\nWell, since my official diagnosis, I am terrified of anaphylaxis. I’m on atenolol for an unrelated heart issue (low dose, 25mg), which I have heard can cause EpiPens to be less effective. My allergist and my family doctor have reassured me that it’s not a huge issue, but they have prescribed extra EpiPens for me to carry just in case.\n\nThis has all come to a head recently as I am headed to Mexico on a trip and staying at an all-inclusive. I have been assured that the resort takes allergies very seriously, including testimonials from others with shellfish allergies who have stayed at the resort. Basically I’ll only be eating at a la carte restaurants, and informing servers of my allergy. \n\nI recently had a major setback after a lunch stop on a road trip, where I started to feel flushed and was convinced I was having an allergic reaction, which escalated into a full-on panic attack on the road. Of course, it was nothing. After about an hour of panic, I managed to calm myself down and continue the trip.\n\nI feel like I’m going to freak out in Mexico every time I eat in fear of a possible allergic reaction. I’ve thought about canceling the trip. But I feel like if I let my anxiety win, I’ll end up backed into a corner mentally and I’ll just do less and less until I’m just sitting at home making my own food for the rest of my life. \n\nMy main fears are having to use the EpiPens, as I don’t know what it will feel like, and secondarily them not working at all. I’m also now stacking anxiety on anxiety, as I’m now fearful of having a panic attack in Mexico, perhaps even more so than having an allergic reaction.\n\nI try to tell myself I’ve never had an anaphylactic reaction, even when actually consuming shrimp. Of course I won’t ever be doing that ever again. I just can’t get it out of my head the thought of having a reaction and dying at the resort in Mexico.\n\nI don’t really even know what I’m asking. Maybe for reassurance? Maybe for some coping mechanisms? Maybe for advice from other people in similar situations.\n\nThanks.\n\n",

But over the summer I faced a stressful time and ended up taking it 5 days a week for about 6 weeks. There was a time or two where I was flying so I increased the dose to 0.5 (maybe two times). When I got home I weaned down by going to 0.25 for 5 days and then to 0.125 for 2 weeks then off. During the withdrawal I started developing rebound anxiety. Like I started having anxiety doing things that I would normally comfortably do before the summer. I stayed off the med for about 12 days. My biggest symptom was all day anxiety and I started avoiding going places because of the anxiety. My doctor told me to take it when I need it. But now I’m always nervous. Another doc( friend) told me I should increase my dose to 0.5mg for 7 days then slowly taper. Over a month or two. Will this fix my new anxiety problems? I’m getting depressed through this process. Any advice? ",

It can make it last all day and well into the afternoon, until night time when it usually goes away and then by then im so exhausted that i fall asleep early just for it to start again. It’s like it comes in spells.. sometimes i feel like im free from this feeling when i wake up with no anxiety knowing that i feel fine and have no anxiety at all during that day, and then sometimes i will be like this for days at a time. its literally ruining my life. i have really bad health anxiety and i just feel like im constantly looking for things to be anxious about no matter how badly i want to not be. no matter how many times i say to myself that im fine, i just can’t seem to truly convince myself. i’m writing this from bed in the dark because the dark is the only thing that helps me feel any sense of calm anymore. i don’t know what to do i feel like im trapped in my head and it’s like im being tortured. Can anyone relate or does anyone have ANY tips or advice on how to deal with these feelings? i was like this before for a long time and one day it all just stopped, and then my grandma died a month ago and since then ive been a ball of anxiety convincing myself something is wrong with me constantly. im so tired 😭😭😭 please if anyone can give me any advice i would be so grateful ♥️",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "First of all time and healthy living. Then I would try to reframe how I think about these things. But don't get stuck on something and ruminate, you can't intellectualize  everything, sometimes just feel. if you get stuck search outwards for help instead of inwards. You have to decide that no matter if things seem meaningless to you, a happy life is better than an unhappy one and you can do things that makes you or someone else happier, healthier, better off, that's meaning.\n\n\n\nI mainly had social and the big one for me existential anxiety, fear of death etc. Ironically the existential one helped with my social one, the thought that being afraid of people as nothing compared to the existential one. The Social one was probably not as bad as many have it but I just exposed myself a lot, really made an effort to go out there, make friends and see it as a challenge or an adventure. I really tried not caring about what people think of me, as I can't control that and that it won't be the truth of who I am and just enjoy myself.\n\n\n\nThe existential one, the big one for me. First I knew that some days I would be very scared and other times I wouldn't even think about it, so I knew that it was I that created the fear, nothing is scary it's just our interpretation that creates the fear. A person could freak out underground with walls closing in on it, while a mole would love his cozy little den.\n\n\n\nI would have these fears of dying of a heart attack while sleeping. Ironically what helped was thinking it's just as likely to die of a heart attack when awake, chance is actually lower when sleeping and I will wake up from it so i might as well sleep. I was scared that a comet striking me or a bullet flying would kill me. All these things are manifestations of fear of death and loss of control. Truth is that we are never in control and that we will die with 99.999999% (repeating of course) certainty. What we can control is how we feel about it and that is where my next tip helps.\n\n\n\n**I adopted a we know nothing attitude**. That the universe and life and death is so complex that we can't begin to fathom it and then try to be excited by the unknown rather than scared of it. Imagine how boring it would be if you knew all ends(actually you can enjoy that too, like when I keep rewatching lord of the rings) it's the uncertainty that adds spice. And in that uncertainty wouldn't it be better to assume something positive than something negative? That we are here is truly something special and we can't know if we go to heaven after or that we're reborn, or whatever we haven't even thought of yet. \n\n\n\n**the way I see it we are all connected,** all living things are one, we are existence, so in that sense we are immortal. If you think about it the way life is laid out is pretty perfect, we all get our personal story to tell with highs and lows. In my opinion earth is heaven or hell, it's just a matter of perspective.\n\n\n\nFor philosophers to listen to I like some of what Carl jung and Alan watts says. Hope some of my ramblings helped you somewhat, now go out there and enjoy yourselves and spread the love the best you can.",

        "Text": "Sorry for the dramatic title, but I have no other way to phrase it. Since about early September, I've been convinced that something is wrong with me. it started with abdominal pain, convincing me I had colon cancer and culminated with a trip to the ER, at which point they found nothing wrong with me. They referred me to a gastro who emphasized that there was probably nothing wrong, but we scheduled a colonoscopy all the same. I had hoped the anxiety would ebb after that, especially when my gyno ended up identifying a potential issue.\n\nI realized how bad my anxiety was, so I made a psych appointment and got put on Buspar. I was told it would take a few weeks to work, and to hold tight.\n\nThen came the tingling. It started in my hand and arm on the left side, which told me I was having a stroke or heart attack. After convincing myself that wasn't the case, I then became sure that I had a brain tumor and was dying. Talking to my doctor resulted in some reassurances and a referral to chiro/PT (not the \"realign\" you kind, but nerve therapy combined with rehab). In the leadup to that appointment, the tingling moved into my head., and then on both sides. When I got seen, the chiro immediately noticed a lot of tension in my shoulders and neck and wasn't surprised by any of my symptoms. She got to work with several plans of attack.\n\nWhile waiting for this to work, I asked for a referral for an MRI on my neck (and hoping it'll snag parts of my brain to put my mind at ease).\n\nIn the middle of this, the buspar started working, but not enough. I asked for an increase from 5mg to 7.5mg. Shortly after, some major brain fog kicked in. I can't concentrate, and I feel like I'm stumbling on my words or reading them wrong. Logically, I know it's the Buspar — I've read the threads here. I asked my pharmacist and she said it was normal, but should stop at the two week mark. I'm almost there, and so my brain is running wild with the fact that I almost definitely have a tumor. I know that I'm misreading stuff because I'm normally a fast reader, and now I'm going too quick for my brain to keep up with. But it doesn't change anything.\n\nI'm convinced that I'm dying. Even if I logic it away (the tingling is bilateral, so it's probably not a brain tumor; the tingling is going away with the PT/chiro/rehab; the brain fog and concentration happened with the increased dose), I'm convinced that I only have a matter of time left.\n\nFor the most part it feels like the buspar is helping my anxiety, but I have these breakthrough moments that I just can't shake. I have a therapist and we're working through it too. I'm trying so hard but I feel like I'm still not there (which also further triggers my anxiety because hey maybe that's a mood/mental change)\n\nAnyway, I don't know what the point of this post is? Just to get the thoughts out of my head? Thank you for reading if you made your way through here.",

I miss that bright-eyed fearless kid who was up for anything and had creative solutions for every problem.\n\nThese past few days I've been skipping meals and doing nothing  but work and sleep again. Every morning I startle awake and lie in bed dreading work. I feel so silly and weak. Am I ever going to get used to the pressure or should I just give up and find an easier job?",

It feels like a light feeling sorta like you were lifting a heavy weight and put it down and then picked up a light weight. I most of the time feel like I sorta can't feel my limbs too, especially the top of my scalp. Been to the doctor and they seem to think its related to anxiety. I've also have alot of trouble sleeping things like I won't ever wake up again or that my perception of reality will be diffrent if I fall asleep. Can anyone relate? I've looked around the internet about the lightness in the limbs but can't seem to find much about it.",

It still affects my daily life. Sometimes it will kick in and last for 30-45 minutes because of this or that. Of course some days are easier than others and there’s more symptoms and situation and what not I can go into. My question is on this symptom or tick or habit whatever it might be. When I’m talking to people or doing something I usually take mental notes on things I say or do or think about the  impressions that these things can give and just analyze a lot. It makes it hard to just relax man it’s so exhausting. It’s hard to live in the moment and be present. I know that the things I ruminate about don’t matter I’m 100% aware that I’ve done nothing wrong and that literally literally everything is ok but still the habit persists. I’m aware that this is a classic anxiety like thing but I’ve always wondered if this could be ocd related. I’ve read a little bit about this and have displayed other symptoms of ocd. I know mental health is a mixed bag of crap so idk I’m not looking for a definitive answer just looking for thoughts from other people who could understand. I types this up quickly so excuse the grammar and punctuation. ",

        "Text": "Never thought I'd use Reddit in my life but here we go.\n\nAs you read the title. I'm just another 18 year old, scared and complaing over life.\n\n(or what I've read so far. Also sorry for any terrible grammar mistakes, and my sentences just jumping all over the place. all of this is new to me. Sorry!)\n\n\n\nI just can't gauge on what I feel anymore. My body feels like it's on autopilot, just getting up to do simple tasks, which then ultimately leads me going back to playing video games all day. I hate it. I hate myself because of it. \n\n\n\nI say I wanna do more, but all I do is mindlessly scroll on TikTok or whatever the latest dopamine rush. I just can't take it anymore. I hate having this heavy heart, I hate being such a burden to my parents. They work so hard for me and my brother's. and what do I have to show for it? Nothing... \nI try not to cry every day, but deep down this feeling of being utterly worthless is just what I bear. I want to be happy. I want to feel normal, and proud of myself. But I lack any self-worth.\nIt probably doesn't even help that own brothers don't talk to me. (At this point they aren't even brothers, more like roommates.) So any motivation from them is nada. \nYet, I don't bother to ask for my parent's help. Why? Because I just end up crying like a pathetic loser. I hate being so emotionally weak in front of them. I'm no man. I just get overwhelmed so easily... Hell, I almost cried during my first interview at my first job. (The interview went pretty okay nonetheless, still haven't heard back tho.)\n\n\n\nIn high school, I've never been the outgoing type. Sit down, complete your work, and don't talk to other kids. That's all I was. Just the introverted silent kid. Sure, I had \"some\" friends back in middle school and \"some\" in high school, but of course I ruined it all. I don't have real irl friends anymore. I love my online friends, but it's just not the same. I just wanna connect with people my age. If it's online wise, I'm the loudest, goofiest player. I don't strike up convos, but when someone speaks to me with a microphone, I have no problem speaking with them as well. But irl? I'd rather teleport back to my room and scream in my pillow of how awkward I am. I know this needs to change, but I just can't bring myself to change.\n\n\n\nBack to school, I used to be a bad kid. I'd always disturb the class, throw paper balls at friends, laugh loudly in class... but I did change my ways a bit. My years through middle school and high school, I've focused more on my schoolwork. I'd become a straight-A student for a couple of years. Some B's and C's here and there, but who cares?\nI've also gotten some achievements like \"student excellence,\" but over time they feel like nothing but stupid paper to me now. \n\nI haven't gone to college or university. which just makes me feel more worthless because now I'll just work some soul-killing job for the rest of my life. \n\nI'd like to be financially stable or \"free\", I've read through most Reddit posts about that. But just reading through it all, knowing that I won't ever become financially stable, just makes me look stupid for even trying. Just reading through it all about stocks and 401k's is just so exhausting. I shouldn't be feeling this way, I shouldn't even be reading any of this stuff at all. I should be a normal 18 year old, enjoying life with friends. But I'm not. I just want to help my parents out. Spoil them from all the hard work they've done for me and my brothers.\n\n\n\nBut then again, I have no passion, no hobbies, and no connections with irl people. For crying out loud, all I do is play video games. Sometimes I boogie board at the beach, doodle and draw some digital art, make stupid gaming YouTube videos, and sometimes I work out. But is all of that gonna help pay the bills? I don't think so.\n\nIt also pisses me off seeing stupid TikTok videos of \"locking in\" and \"your parents aren't getting any younger.\" I already feel terrible, you don't have to rub it in. (lol)\n\nHonestly, I'm making myself feel MORE worthless by reading Reddit posts about kids with the same problem as I do. I know I'm not the center of the universe, everyone has their trauma and or suffering in their own ways. I know I'm just being hypocrite for even complaining here. Just complaining to get some little validations from strangers I don't know.\n\n\n\nYet here I am. Wasting my life, your time, and my time. I know I won't get any \"professional\" answers here, nor will this post ever help me in any way shape or form. I should just go seek a therapist, but I don't wanna be more of a burden to my parents... so speaking to online strangers it is :)\n\nI never wanted to commit suicide or try cutting myself, just based on religious reasons. Either way, Why would I even do so anyway, that'll only make me more of a burden than I already am.\n\nI just don't know what to do with my life. I just wanna go to bed and never wake up. I'd rather be in hell, so then maybe it'll take some stress off my parents shoulders.",

As, I assume sex is a big part of almost everyone’s life, I feel like it’s a big risk to take. I’ve been hearing stories of people experiencing PSSD and it’s making me worry about long-term side effects as well. I’ve read that some people even regret ever taking SSIR‘s because of this condition. Anyone have any personal experience? Any men out there with similar thoughts?

        "Text": "18y M - father diagnosed with MS.\n\nI’ve always had health anxiety, even as a kid. I remember thinking I had melanoma because I noticed a freckle that was slightly larger than the others, and I once convinced myself I had diabetes because I pee a lot. So, this isn’t new, but this time, it feels more serious and genuine.\n\nI’m experiencing a wide variety of symptoms that may simply be due to anxiety or stress about possibly having MS. These symptoms include things like pins and needles in my hands or feet—especially if I have my feet up while watching TV for too long, or if I’m crouched for a while and then stand up. I also feel a prickly heat sensation when I’m warm, but only in certain situations. For example, it happens if I’m in a hot house or wearing clothes that make me too warm, but strangely, it doesn’t happen when I’m out in the sun.\n\nMy eyelids have also started to twitch and feel droopy. They don’t visibly twitch when I look in the mirror (at least not enough for me to visibly notice it), but I can definitely feel it. My friend mentioned about a month ago that her friend with MS (unrelated) has a bad eye twitch, and now, four weeks later, I’m experiencing it too—it’s been happening for a few days now. If I drink, it seems to go away, or maybe I just don’t notice it. It is very noticeable and distracting and I can't avoid the feeling without getting drunk, frankly.\n\nIn the past month or so, I’ve also woken up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty, and twice now, I haven’t been able to lift my limb. It felt like dead weight. After sitting for a moment, it sort of “woke up” and returned to normal. The first time, it was my hand (which I had been sleeping on), and the second time, it was my leg, which wasn’t being compressed by anything as I was lying on my back.\n\nI also feel slight muscle twitching in my legs, mainly when I’m sitting. It’s random and frequent, I’ll suddenly feel the smallest twitch in my calf, quad, or hamstring. It isn't painful or long, just brief, common, twitches. Also recently, I had really bad hand twitching. If I made a flat palm, my ring and pinky fingers would twitch. It affected my left pinky the least, followed by my left ring finger, then my right pinky, and finally my right ring finger the most—essentially in line with how much I tend to fidget with each finger, as I used to flick my chapstick with them. This made perfect sense, so I stopped flicking about a week ago, and it has improved a lot. It’s not fully gone, but I’m pretty convinced that was the cause. I’ll give it more time, so I’m not too worried about the hand twitching.\n\nThe reason I mention all of this is that I’m not sure if I’m just bringing these symptoms on through stress or if they’re actually MS symptoms, made worse by the stress of thinking about it. I feel I am going down a deep spiral.. I’m afraid to see a doctor because of the long wait times for an MRI. I’d probably die of anxiety waiting. I don’t normally experience anxiety outside of health anxiety, but if I had to wait weeks or months to know if I have a life-altering disease, I don’t think I could handle it without becoming an alcoholic, lol. It does not help my father having MS increases my odds exponentially, and that makes me even more worried.\n\nAny advice or reassurance? I’d appreciate anything. Thank you for reading my long, anxious rant.\n\nEdit - Just to provide some more info, my left leg, above 7 inches above ankle to the side, keeps twitching and has been for about 5 minutes, a twitch per second, then pause, then come again. Unsure as to whether it has stopped or is gonna come back. The left eyelid has twitched a lot more in the past 20 minutes, and then stopped about 10 minutes ago. ",

Concerned, I visited the doctor, who ran a series of tests and confirmed that everything was normal, advising me not to worry. However, as the symptoms persisted, I returned to the doctor. After more comprehensive testing, including a heart ultrasound, everything once again came back clear. I was told that anxiety might be causing my elevated heart rate, and I was prescribed Concor 5mg, which I’ve been taking daily ever since.\n\nSix months later, I began noticing new symptoms. I felt increasingly forgetful, cold sweats, frequently confused, and especially disoriented in crowded places like malls. It was as if I was in a constant state of brain fog. Concerned, I went back to the doctor. After more tests, which all came back normal, the doctor recommended that I try Ashwagandha.\n\nWhile I was taking Ashwagandha, I noticed a gradual improvement. However, once I stopped, the symptoms began to return—although they weren’t as intense as before.\n\nNow, a year has passed, and I’m still taking Concor (as without it, my heart rate spikes to 140-150 bpm). While I still experience occasional confusion, it’s not as severe as it was initially. I’ve also noticed some weight gain during this period.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice or insights on how to manage these symptoms, as they have been taking a toll on my daily life and well-being. I am 34 years old, with a wife and child depending on me, and I’m the sole provider for my family. Any guidance or suggestions you can offer would mean a lot.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n",

        "Text": "Hi everyone,\n\nTW!!: Suffocation/DV\nFirst off I would just like to preface saying I know this will be a long read, and I know I can only receive accurate recommendations and absorb others experiences, however I truly feel at my wits end. Just for some background, I just turned 19, I have always had low iron/anemia issues, and I have a family history of hole in heart and murmur issues (heart in general) and I am a smoker, I just quit nicotine disposables but engage in 420 friendly activities often.\n\nOver the past couple of years I have had some extremely scary instances passing out. The first time this happened was years ago, I am not aware of how long I was out, however during me passing out I had experienced a loss of bladder, which I know is usually uncommon. These symptoms came and went over years, with me only ever feeling “super super” dizzy once every 6 months (if that) and before this year only passing out/fainting a couple times after the original spell.\n\nIn the middle of January, I experienced suffocation and hypothermia at the hands of my ex partner. In late January/Early February I had a bit of a hardcore night partying (only 420 activities were engaged in, nothing else.) and passed out after going to school and then standing for about 30 minutes the next morning. About 2 months later, about a month after I had got free from my ex relationship, I had been standing around a fire with my family for about 20 minutes and passed out/got sick to my stomach.\n\nAs summer came I became VIOLENTLY ill. Dizzy every time I stand up, heart beat as fast as a race horse even when just laying in bed, chest pains, passing out and shaking, sweating x10 more than ever before, increased anxiety and worst of all extremeeee fatigue mixed with anxiety induced insomnia. Not going to bed until 2,3,4 am and not waking up until 12,1,2 pm. I have the feeling of impending doom and my chest caving in constantly. It’s the scariest feeling I have to live with. I have been to doctors, the ER, Urgent Care, and worked with a neurologist. I have experienced loss of sensation in my left side (eye and reflexes) and as of mid July my Iron test came back at a…get this. 4!!!!. I have tried a mix of vitamins, iron, magnesium, etc…, have switched diets and tried to decrease anxiety but, nothing helps.\n\nI’ve been told I don’t have POTS, but I know how hard a diagnoses is to get, especially at my age. I have heart issues in my family history as mentioned, but after EKG’s and having my heart checked numerous times, I have never had any abnormalities, skips, or irregular beats. Im really hoping someone (even though I hope you haven’t lol at the same time) has experienced this so I can have some sort of feeling that I’m not letting myself get worse and worse if it’s something serious. Idk if I’m overlooking an issue that could be caused from the physical DV aspect or I’m completely overlooking an actual medical condition that I haven’t thought of :( I don’t want to give up and say it’s just stress and smoking.\n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR ANY HELP❤️❤️❤️",

        "Text": "I am at a crossroads in life, on the outside i am doing  alright, but I feel lost especially when it comes to life and it's purpose for me. \n\nFor some reason I'm worried about the long term, constant anxiety around the future. \nMy job is fairly average, enough to live by but nothing extravagant and definitely not something I can afford a house or family on. \n\nWhat I think is the purpose of life keeps changing \n\nA few years ago if you had asked me,I would have said that my purpose in life was to see as much of the world as possible. But now I'm not so sure. There are a few places that I'd love to visit but I don't think it's as important for me as it used to be. \n\nMy friends have all moved away for work or marriage. So the loneliness of adulthood is now hitting me. \n\nMy parents are getting old and although they do not want me to worry about them, I have constant anxiety about their future after they retire. I think subconsciously the new purpose of my life is to take care of them when they are older and not working. I know they want me to be successful but deep down they would also want me to be around them. \n\nThe same goes for relationships, I am not quite sure what I am looking for in a relationship, my preferences in a partner keep changing, so much so that I really don't trust myself in a relationship. More so after a heartbreak last year. Sometimes i'd like some outgoing or outdoorsy, other times someone nerdy and now someone calm and introverted. Even when it comes to physical characteristics I can't seem to have a specific type. \nI've examples around me of both amazing and awful relationships and that further confuses me. \n\nI've got two neighbors both of them retired divorcees. Seemingly doing nothing and it depresses me to see what could be a possible future for me. They live by themselves and I can't imagine how lonely it must be for them. \nThis adds an urgency and anxiety to my search for a partner. \n\nMy job is fairly simple and straightforward and I think it gives me too much time to overthink and constantly stress about things out of my control. I need to find hobbies that keep my mind occupied. \n\nI know I'm still young and have a few years left, but it's hard to function with no clear purpose or goal in mind. School and university offered structure and clear directions and there was always someone telling me what to do and I think since I've graduated the loss of that direction has affected me more so than others.\n",

The people that live above me are not exactly the quietest people in the world and my bedroom is also on the first floor next to a big window right next to a parking lot. Every creak, gust of wind, anything makes me jump or is extremely bothersome. Even new smells. Its driving my anxiety up and making me nauseous and have chest pains and Im struggling to relax at bedtime. This isn't my first time on my own or in an apartment but it's for sure a different living experience. Does it just take time to get adjusted and feel safe? Any tips or suggestions would be so appreciated. ",

His food always looks better than my own lol. An hour and a half later he said he started getting really cold out of no where. So i just thought my house was cold, cause tbh it was! We cuddled for a little bit after and then he left. I felt him before he left and he had no fever at all. An hour later he told me he has an elevated temp of 100. I have anxiety about being sick for my own personal reasons, but this year it has been at the highest it's been in YEARS. Due to having covid, being sick a lot, having surgery, and now being underweight so I worry for my body sometimes. Of course my immediate reaction is to freak out cause I do everything in my power to not get sick and he doesn't take the precautions I do. I know that this is out of my control and was is done has been done regardless if I get a virus or not. I felt terrible because when he called me to tell me he wasn't feeling good, he started it off with a \"i'm so sorry.\" I want to be a good partner and support him to feel better but at the same time I get nervous. I know I was exposed since I saw him/kissed him before any of his symptoms started, but he probably wasn't as contagious as he is now. I'm trying to reassure myself while also being a good partner. This is HARD! any tips would be nice, I want to be a good partner while also taking care of my own mental health!! one thing I've been using is chat gpt as a mini therapist and it kind of helps a little.",

I constantly fear and stress of stuff like “what if I can’t control my emotions and I unravel really bad” which leads you to do that exact thing and start spiraling, basically worrying about those symptoms causes those symptoms. That’s always been my anxiety, I worry so much about my mental health and what if this becomes real which makes it feel real, it’s a really annoying and frustrating cycle that’s hard for me to break. Like one thing I have is fearing about getting a headache that could lead to something worse (I have bad health anxiety) which me fearing those headaches causes me to get a headache but now I’m fearing this headache truly isn’t a headache but some type of disease or cancer. I just want to know if someone gets what I mean and has something similar. Recently I’ve been fearing what if I have depression and end up driving myself crazy but I don’t think I feel hopeless and the last thing I want to do is die, I’m not suicidal at all, fearing depression makes me depressed because I’m constantly worrying about that fear.

I had my heart checked out multiple EKG, Echo all were normal but because of that im having constant anxiety i can barely get off the couch because my heart rate goes up and anything that makes my heart rate go up i dont wanna do so i dont go outside i actually cant thats how anxious i am this all got worse since the last 2 months earlier this year i was still able to go outside without panicking. Ive been inside since lockdown and now its getting very bad for me. I dont talk to ppl and dont have disctractions I cant even do simple daily tasks i barely do anything all i do is sit all dayy. Im in a bad spot and i dont know how to get out. My doc gave me propranolol as needed but im starting to take it more often 20mg couple of times a week for over a month so not everyday. Recently i got super anxious like i cant get up to do anything without taking propranolol its very bad. Im already going to a therapist but i cant even get to him because of the anxiety its like very severe. I dont know what to do anymore I got two options 1. wait and see if i ever get better 2. take the propranolol daily. But the thing with propranolol is i dont wanna take it my whole life just for a couple of months till i get my life together but ive read that some do have withdrawal symptoms and i sometimes even feel a little rebound from it. So basically i dont know what to do i feel like my life is getting worse everyday has anyone been in this situtation like to the point u cant move because ur anxiet is so bad. Any advice will it ever get better? this is my first post btw im just typing what i can think of sorry for the long text i just had to get it out.",

        "Text": "I hope this article finds you well. \n\nFor most of my life, I could eat anything without any issues. Dairy, gluten, alcohol, and processed sugar never bothered me, and I enjoyed everything without worrying about an upset stomach or brain fog.\n\nIn the summer of 2023 (when I was 25), I started experiencing wisdom tooth pain, leading me to schedule surgery. I underwent the procedure under anesthesia and recovered fairly quickly. My doctor prescribed *amoxicillin* and *extra-strength ibuprofen* for pain and swelling. The nurses advised me to take *amoxicillin* with Greek yogurt to protect my gut bacteria. At the time, I didn’t realize how essential that advice would be or just how vital a balanced gut microbiome truly is.\n\nA week or two after surgery, I began experiencing random bouts of nausea. I didn’t think much of it initially, but by January 2024 (6+ months later), I was increasingly concerned about the recurring nausea. It was also my first encounter with extreme anxiety.\n\nI hadn’t been to a doctor for a checkup in about five years and didn’t have a primary care physician nearby. Eventually, I went for a basic blood panel, which returned normal results, and was prescribed a probiotic. I began taking the probiotic and tried elimination diets, cutting out dairy and gluten, but neither provided lasting relief from the nausea and anxiety. My research into these symptoms, both online and through anecdotal stories, only added to my confusion. I quickly learned that, while Google and Reddit can be valuable resources, they can also provide a lot of misleading information. \n\nAfter not finding relief with initial medical advice, I continued researching and documenting my own findings. I decided to try *Saccharomyces boulardii* and *Berberine*, which gradually yielded the best results. (As always, consult your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.) I also stopped strictly eliminating gluten and dairy, instead consuming them more moderately. During this time, I read about rising peanut allergies in children, attributed in part to a lack of early exposure. This made me reconsider extreme restriction and take a more balanced approach with my diet.\n\nProgress was not immediate; it took months to see real improvement. But now, I can enjoy Kefir and dairy without stomach issues—so I must have been on the right track. I also experimented with the Seed probiotic, which has excellent reviews, and took Thorne’s Gut Health Test with the Microbiome Wipe. Out of all the tests and doctor visits, Thorne’s test provided the most comprehensive and beneficial insights. If you have similar symptoms and can afford this test, I recommend it.\n\nFor anyone struggling with gut issues and the accompanying anxiety, I understand how exhausting it can be. Here’s a list of supplements that I take now, which have helped me feel much better:\n\n* Berberine\n* Multivitamin\n* B-Complex\n* Vitamin D\n* Magnesium and Ashwagandha (on alternating days)\n\nI also highly recommend incorporating physical activity into your week. Running, lifting weights, or even outdoor work can help your body manage real stressors and release tension.\n\nBut most importantly, what got me through the darkest moments and my most anxious times was praying deeply, reading my Bible, practicing gratitude, and memorizing verses. One verse that comforted me profoundly was Psalm 23:4 (ESV): \n\n“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.”\n\nThank you for reading, and may you find relief and peace on your journey.",

This also means that anytime my heart beats differently, I can notice it because I can literally hear the difference. About a year after the surgery I began to have crazy high anxiety triggered by the heart ticks and an obsessive fear of having some sort of medical crisis with my heart. The never ending anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks where I would sometimes go to the hospital because I literally thought I was dying. \n\nIn the last 5 years I have managed to get these panic attacks under control somewhat, but I still sometimes have them, for example right after a workout when my heart rate is really high. \n\nFast forward to today, I am traveling outside the country for the first time and I just had a panic attack for an entirely different reason. It just struck me that I left the US with a very robust and established healthcare system, and I am in a country that has healthcare but I’m not sure if it is the same quality or even how easy it is to receive help if I need it. We were out seeing the sites this evening and I literally had to bail and come back to our AirBNB because I couldn’t stop thinking about that.\n\nI don’t even know the point of this post but I just needed somewhere to share my fear hopefully with some people who might understand.

        "Text": "So I (26F) have been diagnosed with anxiety for about 5 years now. To put myself into context Im an extremely rational person  that loves academic validation. \nI was treated with therapy for anxiety for about 2 years but I stopped my treatment 3 years ago when I moved to a different continent. I’m currently being paid to study something that I love and I have lots of projects coming up. And yet my great anxiety has comeback worse than ever. \nI struggle on planes, I hate being on a car, I’m going on crazy rabbit holes. For example the other day I had a cramp on my left arm and I immediately thought I was having a heart attack and I had to laid down to avoid fainting even though I knew I was being ridiculous. Lately I have starting to have extremely worrisome thoughts -like for example picturing myself dying on different ways including falling on front of the subway or maybe jumping ? I cannot tell what the thought is because my brain response is oh that’s stupid I don’t want to do that but the thought is there anyway. \nIt wasn’t this bad at the beginning of the year but I decided to break up with my boyfriend because I was tired on being on a relationship and I just finished a super demanding project so I’m finding myself with a lot of time in my hands. \nI think this might be related to my birthday? (I can’t tell) It was two weeks ago and I have always hated my birthday. As I moved away from home I have lost contact with friends but I decided to cut ties with them because I felt they were not adding anything positive to my life. And for my birthday most of them forgot/said hb to me late. \nI also almost never leave my place. I have always loved being inside but I think I’m taking it to another level (?). I dated for a while but then I decided to ghost this very nice guy just because I didn’t had the energy to deal with dating someone seriously. \nI’m also a person used to be busy all the time with lots of deadlines and responsibilities so not having much to do at the present moment is a punishment. Another thing is that it’s getting dark at 4.20pm so a lot of the day is dark and I barely see the sun. But then again I have never been a fan of the sun. \nI’m going to start seeing a therapist (but where a live -Canada- the health system is known for its long waiting times) because I know that I’m not depressed I’m actually very excited for many projects (books, conferences, trips) but still it worries me the dark paths my brain takes on its own when I have nothing to focus on. There’s also history of depression/anxiety on my family.\nI don’t know i just thought of sharing this here because sometimes it really helps to write things down or tell them to someone else so my brain can start processing the situation and find the rational course of action. \nanyway thanks for reading and comments are more than welcome",

It’s an up and down kinda thing some weeks I’m more paranoid and others I’m mostly fine. My parents don’t know about these thoughts. I know I’m just being paranoid and that my thoughts are very irrational, so I’ve never brought it up because it’s kinda embarrassing for me. However, they still scare me a lot because a part of me is still like “What if?” You know? I pray a good amount when I’m scared and in general and that does help, but it’s still very difficult to deal with and still very scary. Anyways, I was just wondering how to go about asking my parents if I could go to therapy or something. Should I tell them the reason or would it be ok to be vague and just say it’s because of anxiety? ",

        "Text": "I'm hoping some other GAD sufferers can help put my mind at ease because this last year has been hell in a handbasket with GAD, particularly health anxiety.\n\nIt all started in March of this year when I started getting shooting pains up through my skull at random times. It spiralled me into an episode of HA and during that time these weird random, very brief dizzy spells started. I had a head CT Angiogram in May and it was clear. After that I went on vacation and the dizzy spells went away for a few months. Fast forward to September and they have been back in full force. It's hard to explain, it's not really spinning vertigo, it's like someone grabs the room I'm in and shakes it back and forth repeatedly, very briefly. Its like very quick and brief zaps.\n\nIt is literally like someone pulls the floor out from under me at times. It seems to be exacerbated by being on uneven or flexible ground like a footbridge or second floor packed with people. Any little movement causes me to almost lose my balance for half a second. Isles at stores are bad, Looking at screens also gives me problems particularly at work. Other life events have happened too, like the end of a relationship and some work changes as well. I have been an anxious disaster for two months and am seeing a behavioural therapist starting on Thursday.\n\nIt literally feels like someone pulls the plug on my brain for half a second.\n\nWhen I'm having these brief dizzy spells I feel derealized and disassociated. I feel like I'm on a boat just bobbing and swaying. I know that's the anxiety setting in and taking hold.\n\nThe thing is that it comes and goes, and it happens at completely random times. Saturday was a disaster, Sunday I felt normal & great, yesterday wasn't as great and today has been terrible. After the clear CT I'm having trouble getting into an ENT to rule anything else out, but I guess it's reassuring to know that this isn't anything serious or terribly life threatening. I just want it to go away.\n\nThe only time I feel somewhat normal is when I drink alcohol and clearly that's not a viable solution, or when I'm too busy to notice it, but due to that and the actual nature of the vertigo attacks I'm inclined to think it's purely psychological, as I have no additional symptoms other than that. It could also be PPPD.\n\nWhen these attacks happen it raises my anxiety level even more. It's ruining my daily life. I can't sit at my desk looking at my computer for longer than 20 minutes before I have to get up and walk around and that's not sustainable for my type of work.\n\nAny anxiety sufferers dealing with the same thing and have some tips and tricks that helped you?",

My parents and I are extremely close, and i’m also just a total homebody. I’m visiting my grandparents house overnight which is only an hour and 30 minutes from my home. My brother and I drove down here together and i was a nervous wreck the whole time (we left way too late and i get way more carsick at night). I’m leaving tomorrow around 1-2pm and for some reason even though I know we won’t be here long, i’m just riddled with anxiety. I’m 20F, I feel way too old to be having such a silly fear, it has nothing to do with my grandparents, it’s just simply being away from my parents. I wasn’t going to come because of my anxiety but I had already told my Grandma i was coming and I hate canceling last minute, especially because she was excited, also, you’ve got to spend time with them while they’re still around, I’d feel so guilty someday thinking back on this if I didn’t go. I currently can’t fall asleep because i’m just so amped up from having non-stop anxiety for half the drive here, yet also exhausted, but I know if I fall asleep too soon i’ll just wake myself up again with panic, so I need to just calm down before I try to sleep. Anyways, I really just needed to rant about my stupid anxiety because it’s ruining my life.",

Two with men, one with a woman. Every. Single. Relationship. I would be so anxious to see them, but I would enjoy my time with them. Like during each relationship there was at least once before hanging out that I would throw up. My family members can attest to that. It ruined my last relationship, I couldn't be around him and not be anxious. He just made me anxious. He was also a drunk driver so I promptly ended things (mind you, he was my age) and I can't tell if the anxiety was a gut feeling or something else. \n\nBut for some reason, and now I'm in college, whenever a guy wants to see me somewhere, I pretend I don't see the text. As interested in them as I may be, I get so scared of nothing! I get scared that I will be scared in front of them, I think. Like I don't want to be anxious in front of someone, what if I puke? That'd be so embarrassing, I just choose to not go outside or see anyone because of that. This sucks. Has anyone else felt this way ever like even remotely",

I know we’ve all experienced school life when we had those monthly drills at school which were one of the three- lockdown/active shooter, extreme weather, and fire drills. Long story short, I am deathly afraid of the fire alarm. I’ve got ADHD and anxiety and it’s always been a thing for me to loathe them. Not sure why. It’s not the drill themselves that scare me but the alarm. The flashing lights, the noise… ugh.\n\nAs I’ve transitioned into high school, my fear has lessened slightly, but only because my high school is the only school that actually announces the drill minutes before they do it so you get a little heads up. I’ve figured out ways to avoid it. I’ve emailed the teacher to ask if I could step outside, I haven’t gotten a no yet, but it’s really embarrassing to do that because then they think you’re weird and you’ve gotta live with that for a year.\n\nI’ve got a fire drill tomorrow and I don’t know what to do. I’ve already played the “Can I go to\nthe bathroom” card twice, and this time, I can’t pull that. The teacher is gonna know what’s up.\n\nWHAT DO I DOOOO????\n\nIt gets so bad to the point where I can’t focus and all I can think about is the drill. Non-stop.\n\nSend help!!!!!!

I struggle with loss of control (feeling unprepared) and unpredictability, and I struggle to understand when an attack is coming, and this is not a good thing given that I have clinical responsibilities that are about to intensify both in frequency and demands.

I don’t doubt she has some severe untreated/undiagnosed mental health issues. I’ve never met someone like this in my life. \nUp until probably 2 months ago, I think I was doing a pretty good job coping with it. But things have fallen apart. She’s once again taking us back to court and my anxiety is absolutely controlling my life. Nearly every waking minute is spend in anxiety. \nI have no contact with her, I’m trying so hard to distance myself but I feel this constant need to control situations. \nI had a complete breakdown today because it hit me that I am absolutely miserable and I feel far too deep into this anxiety pattern to climb out. It’s my daily routine, anxiety. I don’t know who I am or what to do without anxiety. \nI can’t live like this anymore. I can’t settle for this anymore. I don’t even know how to begin climbing out of this hole. \nI’m in weekly therapy, i messaged my doctor today to discuss a med change. \n\nTherapy is giving me some good coping mechanisms but I am really struggling to even find the mental strength to follow through.\n\nPlease don’t tell me the answer is leaving my husband. He’s a phenomenal man. I need to learn to cope with my anxiety instead of running from it. I’ve spent my whole life running from anything that made me anxious. \n\nAny advice, recommendations or even support would really help me right now. ",

I'm having panic attacks, which is unusual, and this past week I started having visual hallucinations for the first time. I feel like I'm starting to lose my ability to tell what's real and what's paranoia. I also feel weird whenever I go outside too, like all the trees are fake and everything feels like Disneyland or the matrix or idk.\n\nI take meds (bupropion) which really helped me a lot until the last couple of months where election anxiety and then the job loss plus my partner's constantly having issues at their job that I'm trying to be supportive of and I just feel like I'm cracking...i have a therapist too but she's been unavailable the last two weeks. \n\nI have adhd too and am always forgetful but it's been like forgetting entire conversations and really basic things bad.\n\nToday I went through all my social media and unfollowed a lot of people and groups because a lot of it is fueled by social media. I am going to be more careful with other media I watch too because stuff gets stuck in my head and feels like it's going to happen to me or the world. \n\nWhat does one do in this situation? Call the doctor? Check myself in? I just feel really crazy and it's ruining my life and alienating me from everyone and I'm so tired of being like this but being unable to control it 😭",

It made no sense. I had never had one before. Ever since then, my heart has been checked out I'm physically fine. I cannot shake the anxiety. I've had repeated panic attacks and my anxiety increases throughout the day until I feel I wanna explode at night. There is no trigger. I feel it coming on with a feeling a blood rushing in the back of my head. I'm so scared I've never had any mental health problems. I cant focus on anything else I'm skipping exams. Currently on Klonopin temporarily which has controlled the attacks but I still feel Angry, Nervous, and Sad all the time. Sometimes I can distract myself but I just want to cry. I need to go back to Normal. I have an appointment with my doctor for long term meds but based on what I've seen it seems so unusual for this degree of anxiety to appear so suddenly and without obvious cause. I feel lost. If anyone has dealt with this please let me know. Thanks.",

        "Text": "Hi there!\n\nThis is more of a rant/open to contribution and discussion but I need somewhere to vent this and I feel there are many people in here who may have had similar experiences and hopefully be comforted that they aren’t alone. (Sorry mods if this isn’t allowed)\n\nI’m 22 and have struggled with anxiety since I was 18 (I’ve always been subject to it but 18 was when it started intensely). I had a MAJOR panic attack, I thought I was having a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. They misdiagnosed me with a heart condition and for a month straight I felt sick and dizzy. They did more tests and finally said that they misdiagnosed and that they no longer believed I had a heart problem and that it was actually intense anxiety. \n\nFrom this I’ve developed serious health anxiety where I constantly feel like I’m somehow going to die. Chest pain? Lung cancer. Stomach cramp? Heart related issues. Headache? Brain tumour. You get the idea. But I’m left in a constant state of what feels like wooziness, nausea. This in itself makes me doubt the anxiety itself and makes me worried that perhaps the doctors did miss something and I’m actually in the early stages of heart failure or lung disease. (Even though I’ve been back and forth to the doctors multiple times to have bloods taken etc all with them coming back clear. \n\nAfter my first panic attack and false diagnosis I went T total on everything. No more coffee. No more cigarettes. No more alcohol. No more 🌿. I started vaping just for something but vape on the lowest nicotine quantity.\n\nDespite all this, the worst of it all is the physical symptoms. Most occur even when im not consciously anxious or having a panic attack. The shortness of breath, the air hunger, the dizziness, the dissociation, the nausea, the overall gloom and feeling on edge. This all make health anxiety worse because I worry these symptoms are actually a serious illness. I wish I could just vape and not think my lungs will fall out and collapse or that I’ll die of a heart attack etc.\n\nI just wish I could enjoy life and stop thinking I’ll die at every turn. It’s absolutely exhausting.\n\nI tried CBT and therapy and I’m thinking of going back now.\n\nHas anyone else had any similar experiences? How did you cope? Did you take any steps to seek help and how so?\n\nTL;DR\nIntense health anxiety is exhausting. Physical symptoms of anxiety make me feel that they aren’t anxiety and it’s a serious Illness. I cut all vices out my life and now only vape low nicotine percentage and wish I could just enjoy it without feeling like I’m going to die. Any shared experience or advice much appreciated \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m a 29M, and about 6 months ago I did about 200mg of MDMA (only the 2nd time I ever did it), and about 3 weeks after I started experiencing loads of anxiety / sleep issues. Everything from depersonalization, to random panic attacks, and adrenaline rushes when I try to fall asleep.\n\nI’m not 100% sure that the MDMA was the cause. I was starting to experience sleep issues before this all started, but I’m pretty sure it didn’t help. Since then, I’ve had an MRI (which came back fine) blood work (also fine), and now waiting to see a neurologist for an EEG. I’m currently on no meds, but I may experiment with an SSRI soon.\n\nI wanted to ask if anyone has had any experience with healing their Serotonin receptors, or what I can be doing to help myself on this journey for recovery.\n\nThank you!",

        "Text": "Hello lovely people! I’m new to this subreddit but not new to anxiety. Scrolling through some posts, I see a lot of people asking for help, like, how did you stop it? What do you do when you’re in the middle of an attack? Will this ever end? Questions I asked myself for so long. YEARS of suffering with my own anxiety, here are things that I’ve learned. \n\n*Making it clear, I’m not a doctor and not prescribing. This is for people dealing with anxiety when all tests and doctors tell them they are fine but are still feeling symptoms. And always check with your doctor first!\n\nYou need to find the cause. \n\nIs it: \n\nMental health? Worry, stress, depression, etc… \nPhysical health? Chronic pain, autoimmune, hormones, food intolerance, GERD or hiatal hernia, etc… \nLifestyle: Job, family, friends, society, expectations, busyness, etc… \nIs it a fear or phobia like stage fright or social anxiety… \nUnknown\n\nSometimes these things keep us in cycles. I’m in pain and it’s giving me anxiety, which is giving me more anxiety and keeping me in pain…. We need to break the cycle by treating the root of the problem. \n\nCheck your medicines and supplements. Do an elimination diet, even if that means giving up the main triggers to start (chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, food dyes, sugar). Then move onto bigger changes like gluten free or FODMAP diet if you have to. Check for Candida and try that diet. Look into drinking ACV if you have GERD, especially if meds aren’t helping. \n\nDrink water!!!! \n\nIf you tend to have anxiety at night, if it wakes you up, if you have SVTs (palpitations and tachycardia), drink a little water before you go to sleep. Eat potassium and magnesium rich foods (if you don’t have kidney stone issues). Take epsom salt baths. Drink calming tea. Start a night routine that is comforting. \n\nIf you’re a biological female over 30, check to see if you’re in perimenopause. It can come on fast and last for YEARS and some doctors won’t check hormone levels if they think you’re too young. There are natural treatments and home remedies to help but the symptom list is LONG and causes all kinds of anxiety and palpitations. \n\nAlso, get your thyroid checked. \n\nExercise, even if all you can do is stretch or chair yoga. Just try moving!  \n\nBelly breathing is very helpful. When we’re having anxiety, we tend to chest breathe, which is shallow and not healthy. You don’t need to do box breathing unless it helps (didn’t help me) just normal breathing but be aware of it. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest and feel where it’s coming from.  This is a huge one for me and has helped so much. \n\nStimulate the vagus nerve. If you are having palpitations or tachycardia, bear down and cough. Hum/ Sing. Gargle or gag. \n\nLearn about EFT (tapping). Add that to your daily routine or when you start feeling something coming on. \n\nLive in the present! \n\nPractice intentional living. Create rituals. Do things that you enjoy. Try a hobby. Learn something new. Go outside and be in nature. Focus on others. Volunteer. \n\nAre you introverted or extroverted? Sometimes we need our comfort zone, other times we need to get out there. Figure out what helps you. Does canceling plans and staying home relieve everything? Find ways to live a more simple/slow living lifestyle. Be a homebody if it helps. Focus on doing good in your space. Does sitting at home make you restless and cause more internalized issues? Go out! Burn off that energy. Have fun! Do what you need to take your mind off it. \n\nPositive affirmations/mantras. Say them out loud. Talk about your goals and what you want in life. Talk about your anxiety and tell it to stop. Anytime you feel a hint of it, say NO out loud and redirect with affirmations. \n\nTrain your anxiety like you would an animal. If a puppy is sniffing around to eliminate, you have to redirect it outside and after a while, it learns to go to the door. If you have a kitten and it starts biting your hands during petting, you have to say no or make a noise to startle it and then redirect with a toy so it knows hands are not toys. You have to tell your annxiety out loud what you want from it and physically take action to remedy the situation. \n\nRead about Neuroplasticity and forming new pathways by redirecting. They use these types of therapies with neuro diseases but also helpful with anxiety. \n\nLook at the difference between mind and brain. \n\nRead about the Reticular Activating System of the brain and how it focuses on what you’re thinking about. Decide you want a yellow car and now all you see are yellow cars. It’s your manifesting area. What you focus on, is what you see/feel. Focus on anxiety and you will feel symptoms, especially first thing in the morning when it controls/regulates the sleep to wakefulness transition. Make sure your first thoughts are positive. \n\nSometimes we need to put more of a logic, scientific approach on things and less of an emotional one. Don’t ruminate over false scenarios. Have you had all the tests and they are fine? Trust it. Trust your own body. Don’t let your mind send the wrong messages and throw it into chaos. \n\nRemind yourself, the main cause of heart attacks is from coronary artery disease, NOT anxiety. Unless your cardiologist said you have a form of CAD, you *probably aren’t having a heart attack. Heart attacks on average don’t typically last hours, days, weeks, years… give yourself a time limit and then let it go. If after say, 90 mins, you haven’t had a heart attack, tell yourself you will be fine. In those 90 mins, if you can do something to distract yourself until the timer goes off, that is helpful. They say most of the time you WILL KNOW you’re having a heart attack or you won’t know because you’ll be unconscious or dead. You’re not dead. You’re just playing bad false scenarios of what COULD happen even though it most likely won’t. That is not a way to live. *I’m not a doctor, this is just what my docs have said and what I have researched\n\nIf you’re at a higher risk with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, etc… get healthy. Stress and inflammation can definitely cause issues and possible long term problems. These things don’t get better unless you take action! Start by making healthier choices. \n\nSorry this is so long but I could write a book on this. There’s a lot to unpack with anxiety, as we all know. Everyone has different root causes and ways to redirect. Anxiety treatment is not a one size fits all, unfortunately. But hopefully, we can learn and try and adjust to our own needs. Be well everyone! You got this!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It still hurts but so much less. \n\nThis week I’ve started noticing that I’m constantly tensed up. Like my shoulders are trying to meet my neck kind of tense. I relax them when I notice it but then not even 5 minutes later it happens again. I don’t know how to stop. I do meditations and visualizations and muscle relaxation already. I can’t live in those states though and if I do it too long I tense up without realizing it still anyways. Anyone with any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I have another week until I can ask the pain dr anything.",

I got back into school (am now graduating this December after dropping out with a bachelors!) got a license despite crippling anxiety, and had an amazing year overall. However, I made the grand mistake of when my life is going well, to get off medication and stop seeing my therapist and psychiatrist. For two years, I was fine and it was on and off but mostly manageable. This year I feel extremely restless, but even contacting my therapist I ghosted and my psychiatrist I haven’t seen in two years brings me immense anxiety. Does anyone have any tips? Does anyone relate to my experience?",

Now it's gone overboard. For months it has gradually worsened, and alongside this, I've been struggling with reflux and in recent weeks, stomachache. \n\nNow since I'm out of hospital, it's just surged. I can't just relax. I can't not feel fear or worry.\n\nI'm really unhappy about it and wish it would go away. I don't know whether to think it's gut related or not. I don't know whether it'll improve with meds, or how to even go about getting then in the UK without getting stuck waiting for months, if not years.\n\nJust feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed.

But usually my bp is 120/70s and hr resting is around 80s. Doctor wants me to try the ER 60mg but I'm afraid since I don't have high bp or a high hr all the time that this will tank me? He doesn't seem concerned but I am just because the 10mg (IR not ER) would take me from 120s to 70s-80s, didnt realy affect my bp though. The rest of my cardiac workup has been completely normal this is just some weird thing that keeps happening to me. I would like to add that I constantly feel shaky even if you can't see it, like full body shaky, which does not go away even after taking the propanolol, and have terrible acid reflux lately I can't get under control (working with GI on it) and I can't even drive myself around to get to work or I have this awful panic attack part way in with high hr and feel like im gonna pass out, it'll leave me shaking so much worse than usual for hours and hours after the fact, my prn xanax has not helped with those attacks (although it always helped my regular anxiety before). Even if i don't drive im still struggling in the passenger seat. Anyways, anyone have experience with the ER 60mg propanolol for anxiety when they usually have normal HR and BP?

There's only been one or two times where I didn't have a panic attack after taking an edible, so I'm wondering if there's something I can do to prevent it or if it was situational. Last time I had an edible was 5 months ago maybe. I was 14 and I'd had a really bad day. I was on my period and I ate it, sat on the couch watching baby reindeer, then suddenly my cramps started getting much much worse. They were deeper and more intense it was unbearable. Then I just got this panicked feeling and jumped up, running upstairs. I started feeling like I was blacking out and rushed to my dad saying \"Dad, I need to go to the doctor.\" Very frantically. He was like \"Honey, you're fine. Those things cant hurt you.\" And he just laughed and continued doing whatever he was doing. I collapsed onto the kitchen table and could barely move. My dad picked up my arm and dropped it back onto the table but I couldnt move it. I let my head swirl into the table, 100% convinced I was dying. After a minute I accepted my death, I was praying to die soon so that this would be over but I realized it was taking too long so I jumped up and started pacing around. I'd be in one spot then blink and I'd be in a completely different place. Like I was teleporting. I was trying to run around until my legs went jelly and I felt like I wasn't in a body. I made a song that I repeated to myself. It felt like I'd never escape. I'd be in the basement and blink and be upstairs. I was so nauseous and my cramps were so bad, I had to sit down but it was unbearable sitting down. I don't remember the rest except a dream I had which didnt feel like a dream it felt like..idk weird reality? I was eating a lullaby in it. But yeah I always have panic attacks like this which are really frightening and I want to know if my period or hormones caused it? Its not like I always have panic attacks on edibles, just most of the time.",

My experienced senior colleague went on maternity leave 6 weeks into the job, and the person covering her maternity has also never done the specialism before. As you can imagine this has been very stressful and the team can be demanding at times. \n\nI have had a bad flare up recently of my anxiety, where I am stuck in freeze mode due to overwhelm and sometimes spend periods of time struggling to achieve anything.\n\nI was honest with my work from the application and interview process, and throughout the job so far about my anxiety. I let my manager know that I am struggling to get work done because of my anxiety, I am still managing ward rounds and clinics, it’s more outpatient jobs outside of these that build up. \n\nSince then they have created a prioritisation list to try to help me. I understand the rationale but feel it has caused me more anxiety as my manager today asked what jobs were on there, when they were added, and when I was going to do them. My colleague is also now keeping a tally of who she has seen and who I have seen. Again I know this is a view to try to help, but I feel under the microscope and that if I’m not managing to keep up to speed I am failing. \n\nI have been working lots of extra hours over the past couple of weeks to try to get on top of things, and my anxiety has switched from freeze to high drive adrenaline. I feel more burnt out than ever. \n\nWe did discuss potentially me not being in work, however sometimes time off can make me even more anxious and depressed. In my mind I am still turning up and doing something which is better than nothing, but now feel it is a lose-lose either way. I am so scared if I have another flare up, I will be in the same boat again.\n\nManagement ask me ‘what can we do to help’ but often I’m not sure. I have counselling (booking in extra sessions at present), I tried to get a prescription for some beta blockers, I have annual leave booked and plan nice things in with friends on the weekend to keep me sane. I take noise cancelling headphones into work to help ground and frequently use hot/cold and visual grounding techniques. I’m not really sure what to suggest but I feel the pressure to come up with a solution. \n\nDoes anyone relate to this experience in the NHS/healthcare? \nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions?\nDoes anyone have anything that their boss/management has done to help? \n\nAnything would be really appreciated as I feel very lonely and again in a position where I feel like me and my anxiety are a problem for any workplace (which in turn makes me feel a bit hopeless).\n\nThanks all ❤️",

I share things about me that aren’t always true for everyone else because I want to be seen as “different”. I like for them to see me as some sort of dream girl. Does anyone else struggle with this?

I was traveling for a transatlantic business trip on Saturday morning. \n\nSaturday I woke up and could tell my heart rate was a bit elevated (around 90/100 bpm). I thought it was a bit weird but it continued on during my flight and the rest of the day. I was also very tired and started to develop insane anxiety. So bad, I even went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.\n\nThey did some checks and didn’t think anything was wrong with me, and said it’s probably a virus causing my symptoms and to take it easy. \n\nIt calmed me down a lot and felt better in the evening. I fell asleep hoping next day things would be better. They weren’t. \n\nThe entire day I had really bad anxiety and panic attacks and still an elevated heart rate, pretty sure I was going to die. I also had extremely low energy and couldn’t walk a set of stairs without being out of breath. My panic gets so bad I call my mother who is a nurse and generally I rather not alarm with any symptoms while I’m away, but she was able to calm me down again and told me what I’m experiencing is a combination of stress, anxiety, a cold virus and jet lag. \n\nAgain, I calm down from that and go to sleep, hoping next day things are better. \n\nYesterday was extremely difficult but i survived and didn’t feel extremely anxious but was still aware of my symptoms. \n\nToday my anxiety is back again and I am pretty convinced something is wrong with me. I have back pain, tired legs, can’t walk stairs without being completely out of breath, elevated heart rate while sitting (around 90 bpm) and have some water retention in my fingers and feel thirsty. I also have very low appetite. According to doctor Google I might have myocarditis which is all I can think of right now. \n\nI really don’t know what to do because I kind of know I am fine and all these symptoms can be tracked back to stress , but keep tricking myself into thinking ‘I might not be fine’. \n\nWhere to go from here? I really won’t be able to work until the end of the week feeling as miserable as I’m doing at the moment. \n\n\n\n",

I've been much better at stopping people before it gets too far. But it varies too on timing, it can be immediate, or I can keep it at bay for a few minutes.\n\nLike talking anything related to vaccinations I can't do it, anything epipen or diabetic is like an instant trigger. But its not just needles, even talking about medication and symptoms for a tick bite someone else had has done it to me. Blood pressure talk has. And the other day it wasn't even a person, it was my cat and they had to take a bladder sample. They said too much and said they had to draw it with a needle and that was enough to make me to go flush, luckily I held off until they left the room but I needed to lay down after that to reset myself. \n\nI always was scared of shots growing up, which fueled my fear of the doctors office. Which is also funny because the dentist is fine unless they're numbing with a needle.\n\nDuring Covid, I tried to exercise my fears a little more than usual thinking it may help normalize it, but I never improved and I actually think it made me more susceptible to being triggered.\n\nIt freaks me out because as I get older, I'm 30, well so do my parents and they don't live a super health lifestyle. There is no way I'd even be able to talk about anything health related, let alone manage anything for them because of this.",

She definitely does not like it and got really annoyed when that upset me. After a short while I asked her about her annoyance and she said she's sick of walking on egg shells around me and thinks that I freak out and worry about everything too much and she's tired of it. Tbh she's not completely wrong, I have a lot of anxiety but I thought she was a safe person to talk to about it, I didn't realize how annoying I was being and never considered myself someone people have to tip toe around.\n\nThinking about it some more, I've come to realize just how dependent on her I am. I run all my worries by her looking for advice and her opinion means way more to me than it probably should. I don't really have friends to talk to about these things so she's my go to person. Although I still feel that she was a bit insensitive, I think she has a point that I should stop caring so deeply about her opinion of me.\n\nI guess I kind of have two questions with this. 1. How can I stop caring when my mom disapproves of me? 2. What is a healthy way to deal with my anxiety if I can't talk to her about it?",

I have been diagnosed with ADHD by neuropsychologists, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and depression. Currently, I'm taking Strattera and Zoloft, but I'm facing some significant challenges.\n\nMy Current Situation:\n- Strattera: It helps a bit, mainly by reducing my urge to use drugs (I'm a recovering addict), but overall, its effects are minimal.\n- Zoloft: Despite being on it for 4 months, it causes severe insomnia. Additionally, it triggers cravings for drugs, which I haven't experienced in a long time. I will likely need to stop taking it.\n\nChallenges with Other Medications:\n- Stimulants: While they help in the afternoon, they leave me feeling extremely depressed later on, so they aren't a viable option.\n- Wellbutrin: My doctor advised against it due to its potential to worsen anxiety.\n\nWhat I'm Looking For:\nI need a medication that can help me manage my intense emotions and constant anxiety. I feel that if I were calmer, my ADHD symptoms might be more manageable. I've considered Buspirone, but I'm unsure if it's the right choice since I also need something for depression. My sadness feels chemical and without any apparent reason.\n\nMy Struggles:\n- I feel like a lost cause and don't know what to do next.\n- I need a medication that can help with both my anxiety and depression without causing severe side effects or cravings.\n\nHas anyone else faced a similar situation? What medications or combinations have worked for you? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n",

I absolutely love every bit of it. I told that to my parents, my psychiatrist and school. But they are forcing me to finish high school but i just wanna be home like what the fuck i dont need to be hospitalised there is nothing fucking wrong with me I never fit in with people and have panick attacks whenever i try to act like they want me to. Not even years of therapy would change my mind because I know who I am and what I want. I will be happy to lay in bed and do basic house work for my parents when they work and thats it.\n\nNone of them want me dead but when i tell them the only thing that can make me stop being $u1c1d4L and at peace is to stay at home, cook for them and do house work they dont let me and its driving me insane i cannot stop crying and having anxiety and each day I'm just trying to survive like I am normal I just dont like interaction I am a human being and why do the force me to do something if it doesnt make ME happy. Like if my child wanted to end it and that was the only thing thst could keep them alive i would let them. I would do anything to keep them with me.",

I’ve changed my diet and eat extremely healthy. Cut out caffeine and alcohol completely. I still vape everyday unfortunately but hope to quit that by the end of the year.\n\nToday, I’m feeling this really weird chest tightness. There’s no pain at all. It just feels extremely tight at the sternum and I’m also feeling a burning sensation right below breastbone/center of the upper abdomen. It’s kind of affecting my breathing too even though i’m taking deep breaths. Idk something feels wrong today in general. My heart rate while sitting is also ranging between 90-120 even though I’m not doing anything. No pain elsewhere. Is this my anxiety? I haven’t had any thoughts today except for sharing some stuff with my therapist during our session.\n\nFEELING SUPERRRRR quesy, can someone help me calm down!",

So I deal with pretty debilitating anxiety these days, mainly sleep anxiety (intense anxiety about not sleeping). Anyway, I've been on sick leave for a month and a half now and my mental health has been very bad. Had to call a crisis center last week and ended up going to a mental hospital emergency room. The psychiatrist at the hospital took me off Wellbutrin which my family doctor had prescribed cause I'm pretty sure it made my anxiety much much worst and instead put me on Pregabalin (Lyrica) 50 mg, going up to a 100 mg after a week, once at night. For now I feel 0 effects and I still need to take benzos to get some sleep. I was on Ativan 1mg and resistance kicked in pretty quick and had to take 5mg some nights to counter the panic attacks. Anyway, my family doctor changed my benzo to Clonazepam 1mg but it's also not working, cross-resistance and all. I'm having CBT therapy once a week and I've been working on it at night and I feel like I'm able to reassure myself and keep the panic attacks at bay but there is always still this like constant anxiety that just won't go away no matter how much breathing exercises, meditation and CBT I do and I just won't fall asleep. Again last night, I had to take more than my prescription of Clonazepam and now I'm just scared my doctor will cut me off. Even my pharmacy when we changed acted like I was very sus, but like I'm not seeking a high, I just wanna sleep. People are telling me exercise it will release endorphines and shit but like ya sure, but the anxiety will still be there. I'm just at a loss and getting more and more down. I just need to know it will be okay. ",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "TW: mention of panic attack\n\n\nFor context, I (22F) grew up in a family where my parents simply suck. They gave birth to me solely for the reason of having someone to care for them when they get old. They have no parenting skills and terrible emotion control. Also they have always tried to manipulate me to do what they want, sometimes it's actually good for me but most of the time it's just straight up selfish stuff. I grew up and have always equipped myself with the belief that I should deal with my stuff by myself first, I should rely on myself and learn to love myself properly before loving anyone else. \n\nBeing born to terrible parents also gave me depression and anxiety disorder, which I only got diagnosed 4 years ago when I moved out for uni. However, I didn't begin taking meds until 1 year ago, the reason being I barely had enough money to do loads of tests back then and also I wanted to find a trustworthy place(?) to redo the diagnosis and prescribe for me. A year ago I was recommended this mental clinic run by a quite well-known doctor in my area. I have been visiting this place every month since then. Every visit so far has been fine except for one, which is also the one that I have just had a few hours prior to writing this. The doctor asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said no and I wanted to focus on loving myself first. Then the doctor just kept shaking his head, saying the only way I can get out of this is to get close to other people, go on dates and have a bf. And I said \"while I understand that I should get outside and hang out more to let loose, it doesn't mean that I should simply have a relationship just for that reason. Having a bf or not doesn't change my depression because first thing first I have to learn to love myself\". And not even after I finished speaking, the doctor just straight up said nonononono, handed me the prescription, and shooed me out of his office. \n\nI went out of the clinic confused but I still had some homework to do so I temporarily forgot about what happened. But as soon as I was done, the thought of it emerged again, and I forgot what happened next but all of a sudden, I found it hard to breath and my tears kept flowing uncontrollably. Then my breath started to get heavier and heavier, my heartbeat went crazily, my body felt heavy and frozen, my muscles felt numb. I kept scratching myself, my head, my cheeks, my chest area. I rolled around on my bed try to find some way but I just couldn't stop whatever was going on. My brain felt empty and empty, and the strangest/scariest thing was that it was the first time the thought of jumping through the window just flashed through my mind WITH NO HESITATION. I just simply wanted to end all of that, and the idea of suicide just came naturally to me because nothing else worked. \n\nI forgot what happened in detail after that but after like less than 10 mins or so it kinda decreased and stopped. But then I thought about the strange events that had just occured to me and I felt my tears running down again. I decided to try to distract myself by googling what the thing happened to me could be, and the first thing I saw was panic attack. And I honestly don't know what even led me to this subreddit to write this post because I don't even write diaries. But I guess I would just leave this here as sort of a memo for myself for going through the most terrible day ever. \n\nHonestly speaking, I feel horrible right now. I regret letting this happen to me. Deep down in my heart, I'm deeply hurt, I thought he could have terrible opinions to himself, but he had no rights to disregard my opinions rudely like that, let alone such a sensitive topic to me. But the rational part of my mind is just going \"he is a terrible doctor, so more reason to forget about him, why am I bothered to shed tears for such thing?\" and this is making me regret even more. \n\nIf you made it here, thank you so much for reading all this crap. I genuinely hope you'll find peace wherever you are on your journey 🫂\n",

The problem is that I don’t like my personality, and I feel a strong need to change it. For the past six years, I haven’t been in a relationship, and I keep feeling like something is wrong with me. People tell me I should improve my personality. While my friends say others are attracted to me because of my looks, they also point out that my personality is lacking.\n\nI’ve been in three relationships so far, and none of the people I proposed to have ever turned me down. However, I feel like those relationships didn’t last because of deeper issues within me.\n\nRecently, one of my friends told me that her friend had a crush on me. I was really happy to hear that, so I sent her a friend request, which she accepted. We started chatting, but after a while, she lost interest and stopped responding. Curious about what went wrong, I asked my friend to find out what she thought of me. Her response was, “He has the looks, but his personality isn’t enough.”\n\nAnother situation that bothers me is my social awkwardness. For example, if I’m in a room with five people, I can talk, laugh, and have fun. But when most of the group leaves, and I’m left with just one or two people, I suddenly become clueless about what to say or how to continue the conversation. I also have trouble talking to girls I meet unexpectedly; I freeze up and don’t know how to engage in a meaningful conversation. I don’t smoke or drink, and while I don’t think my personality is toxic, I feel like it’s just not strong enough to make a lasting impression.\n\nA lot of my struggles come from issues in my past, especially family problems that have caused me emotional pain and left me feeling depressed. Even when I’m supposed to be enjoying happy moments, thoughts of my past come rushing in, stealing my joy. Because of this, I often have a sad expression on my face. Ever since I turned 18, it feels like I’ve forgotten what true happiness is.\n\nRight now, more than anything, I really want a meaningful relationship in my life. I know people say that it’s not about looks, but about what you do and who you are. Deep down, I feel like looks don’t matter as much as people think. I just wish I could develop the kind of personality that makes people want to stay, not just be attracted to the surface.\n\n",

Once I have one, I’ll feel off for days after. I guess I’m looking for more people who have similar attacks as I do. \n\nI’d like to add once the anxiety has passed the “ feeling crazy “ is laughable to me. But it’s scary how real it is in the moment. I guess I’m looking for support and positive stories and to know I’m not alone ❤️ ",

Laughing and enjoying it. This sounds crazy I know, and I know it's crazy. I logically know nobody would give THAT much of a fuck about me, but emotionally I STILL FEEL IT. Then I get angry for no reason and withdraw from them. I avoid them for a week sometimes. And that only makes my fear worse, because NOW they know they're getting to me and they're enjoying it. ",

I have been cramping pretty bad on the left side of my stomach/side of it for the past 2 days and recently started having brown and kinda pink discharge too (I don't know if the pink discharge is actually blood or not) I don't know if it is an infection or not because at the moment I am also ovulating and I know those 2 can be symptoms of ovulation. But the thing is, this has never happened to me before while ovulating, and another reason I'm scared of an infection is because I just got over a UTI, or which I thought I did, about 2-3 weeks ago. I don't know if it came back or if it never ended and then turned into something more serious. After a few days I thought I ended the UTI, my boyfriend and I had sex without a condom (I am on birth control and he pulled out), but I immediately went to the bathroom afterwards. I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday but I can't stop overthinking that I have something more serious and I am very impatient. Also, another thing to say, I don't really drink water a lot, I often forget to, so I don't know if that is contributing to anything.",

I just wanted to write something up and mention a little bit of what happened to me hoping maybe it could even help a couple of people. I will try to keep it short. \nFor years I was dealing with IBS (mostly C but D also), anxiety and panic attacks to no end, OCD, depression, derealization/depersonalization, vertigo, hallucinations. had no answers, my  doctor said there was not much to do anymore. So I did loose hope a bit.  Anyway fast forward years, I have diagnosed with Mold/mycotoxins poisoning, and Lyme disease with co infection. These both can look like literally so many other things. I had over 25 symptoms that they told me was anxiety. Mold and Lyme can cause ocd, anxiety, depression, amongst many many physical symptoms I had like no appetite, constant nausea, numbness, vertigo, etc. I guess I just wanted to say, it could be worth looking into Mold, Lyme, MCAS. Any questions I would love to talk. I wish the best for everyone \n \nTLDR: if you have countless symptoms but in tests you’re “healthy” Mold poisoning, Lyme Disease, and MCAS worth looking into for IBS, Anxiety, OCD, Depression and literally any physical symptom under the sun. We deserve to be healthy, and we deserve to be heard, not given pills and just be pushed aside. Again please feel free to reach out",

Last Friday I had sudden tightness in my chest and upper back followed by a panicked feeling. I took the day off and saw a doctor. She said everything seemed fine and it was a panic attack. She prescribed me Lexapro 5mg to start the next day. Over that weekend I had three other anxiety attacks and Sunday threw up all day. I took off again Monday and thought I was feeling calmer and less nauseous. Then this morning (Tuesday) I began to feel extremely anxious again before leaving for school. I was nervous I would have an attack in front of the kids and called out again. \n\nI talked with my assistant principal on the phone who was supportive and recommended I talk to my doctor about a two week leave or so to allow my new medication to begin working. I have lost of guilt about being out for two weeks. I feel like I’m being dramatic and should be able to handle the job I’ve done for the last 8 years. I am looking for other jobs and the stress of transitioning and being able to keep paying my bills is getting to me too. I know it’s important to take care of myself but what will I do for two weeks? And will it actually be better in two weeks? Any advice is welcome.\n\nThank you\n",

I'm seeking support outside of uni for my mental health but it's a charity that can't prescribe meds (and also hasn't got back to me for weeks) because my GP wouldn't listen to me the last time I tried to go and I've tried every other charity in the area. I feel as if I'd really benefit from meds and the CBT I'll be offered just isn't enough (tried it before and it didn't help).

I have GAD. \n\n\nSo,\nI got misdiagnosed in HS with ADHD and was on and off stimulants (horrible experience if u have anxiety). I had a feeling that I didn’t have adhd but I kept telling myself maybe I do and need to give meds more time(on and off them for 3years lol). \n\n\nTook me months honestly to go finally talk to my doctor and speak up bc I was so anxious to go in (he wasn’t the one who misdiagnosed me. Anyways I told him I want a lower dose bc the anxiety is genuinely unbearable and I also can’t focus in uni.. so I need the meds and need help. We talked more about my anxiety and symptoms etc and he agreed I may have been misdiagnosed so he prescribed me antidepressants (Wellbutrin) for anxiety instead.\n\n\nLet me just say I was so so scared to try the anxiety meds, as someone who is very scared of meds and used to be overly skeptical of them. when I did try it tho (I’m at a higher dose now) I truly felt so much better and a noticeable change!! Social anxiety, anxiety towards just anything just decreased!! Like it was easier to move past the feeling and the thoughts. And let me not forget intrusive thoughts, i rarely get them anymore!!!! It’s been almost a year now and i honestly wish i had spoken up earlier. I do have very bad anxiety but the medication make it so much easier to get through the day and push myself past things and show up more.\n\n\nTo anyone out there, it’s okay to reach out for help. Sooner is better than later and I promise it can get better, you need to reach for the help you need (while shaking in your boots) and find the right resources. You’re not alone!!!! You deserve the comfort in your skin and mind. Things don’t have to be so hard and you don’t have to do things all alone and you don’t have to stay in things that aren’t working for you.

Everytime I start to run or whatever and the symptoms kick in, shortness of bread, tachycardia,  chest pain , etc. I stop thinking I'll die. I went to cardiologist 2 weeks ago. I've been going to cardiologists like once a year and they always tell me I am ok. This time they make me run while checking my heart rate and they told me it was all normal even with the chest pain, that my problem is I have no condition. \n\nBut like, I keep trying but I still.avoid everything thinking this doctor is wrong and I might have something wrong. \n\nI got a perfect holter , a perfect blood pressure and a healthy heart ( that's what the doctor said ) \n\nBut it's awful that I run a few seconds and I start to feel like I will die. \nThen I started reading that chest pain during exercise = heart problems so I get more scared\n\nDoes anyone else have chest pain while exercising? Is not awful but enough to scare me a bit \n\nEdit : I am 26 years old that never smoke , do drugs or drinks alcohol. ",

I was cutting out sugar to lose weight but then I also read it can help with anxiety too, but so far these last 4 days have been a nightmare. \n\nHas anyone else cut out sugar and saw their anxiety increase before it got better?

Sometimes, I even question whether it’s just anxiety or something more serious.

After  that I started getting every symptom youve seen on this sub, heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, chest pains, muscle twitches, headaches, sense of doom, etc etc. Fast forward one month I went thru some therapy, a lot of talking to my brain and I got myself to a much better place. \n\nAt around week 2 I went to the doc and got ekg, which came back as a little quick but attributed to anxiety, and blood work\n\nFirst round of blood work came back with high calcium 10.5 (high is 10.3) TSH was 1.6 (range 0.45-4.5) and T4 1.73 (range 0.88 - 1.77)\n\nAlso had slightly high cholesterol for 23y/o which wasn't good for my anxiety lol\n\nSo the doc ordered more tests, Calcium, PTH, and vit D. \n\nCalcium came back to normal again (9.8) and PTH is 17 (not sure what that means) bit vitamin d is low (28.1) I get a lot of sun so that's weird to me.\n\nBeen reading a lot how thyroid issues can cause anxiety especially if it's sudden anxiety (me), wondering what these numbers might mean in that regard\n\nI also read how tsh and t4 at opposite ranges are concern for thyroid issues (my tsh was on the lower side and t4 almost too high, but both within normal range so not flagged) and also how vitamin d defiencency is closely related to thyroid. \n\nUnsure what the pth test is and what my numbers mean\n\nAny insight or experiences in any of the above greatly appreciated ",

(M, 34)  \n  \nI've been having a lot of thoughts about reaching out here on Reddit and hearing your thoughts on how you feel/experience your anxiety, cause I'm not sure if that is what I'm experiencing or if it is something else. \n\nSo, in 2018 I started (for the first time in my life) not feeling well inside. I was going through a very rough breakup which took me a year or so before I started feeling like myself again. The thing was, that my body afterward somehow got \"stuck\" in the fight or flight mode and I've been fighting with quite a lot of physical symptoms ever since. I've never had a panic attack, I don't feel depressed, I'm not stressed, but either way, I often wake up at night with my heart beating through my chest and a big cold \"clump\" in my stomach - this also occurs during the day, at the office, at home, on a walk, at the gym. I rarely sleep more than 5 hours and during my day it feels like I have a surge of adrenaline, but I don't know why. \n\nMy doctor tried to put antidepressants, but I couldn't really feel any difference and my sleep just got worse, so after trying a few different meds I decided to stop. \n\nDoes any of you relate to this? What the hell is going on with my body? Is this anxiety? ",

He lived on the other side of the country and when he passed we visited with my mom for the funeral and for support. Throughout that time I've felt ok, aside from being sad and upset about my father passing. Issues started once we returned home. My father passed away due to cardiac arrest. There seems to be a possibility of contributing issues but we probably won't know for certain. \n\nMy issue started when I returned home from our visit and I almost immediately started experiencing chest pains and some discomfort. I wouldn't say I go to the doctor regularly but I have been a few times within the last couple of years, no issues with heart or anything. I actually had a number of tests done previously because I had a single \"anxiety attack\" a few years back and was concerned and not sure what happened. This just resolved itself and I've never really had issues since...until now. My father passing away has put my mom in a tough spot, my brother is stressed, im stressed, my wife is stressed, etc. I can of course go back to the doctor and get checked out. \n\nI feel reasonably confident my discomfort is related to this whole situation, though I don't feel actively concerned about things all the time. The pain and discomfort comes on when I start to think about it, or sometimes when I'm communicating with my family. I've tried applying a cold pack to my chest when it starts to act up and it has calmed me down and realived the discomfort. I haven't had issues sleeping, but as soon as I wake up it's like I start to think about the discomfort immediately and it starts to act up again.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some experience with this and if it sounds like anxiety. Some of the typical breathing exercises and stuff tend to relieve me temporarily, and the ice as I mentioned, so I feel confident in this being anxiety. It's been going on for a week + now and no exactly sure what to do. \n\nAppreciate anyone's thoughts. Hope everyone is doing as well as can be expected.",

I personally don't want my teachers or people in my class to know I get panic attacks, which works pretty well, considering that mine are often silent, with only internal symptoms (and some shakiness). I feel really dizzy and stressed out and can barely say a few words. I've tried just asking my teacher if I can go to the bathroom but sometimes I can't even get those words out.\n\nHave any advice, but not letting people around me know (please don't say just talk to them, my parents will get told and I have the most terrifying parents)?",

A few weeks back I took an edible from a friend (having never taken anything before) and had a bad panic attack. I took a much smaller amount two weeks ago and had another panic but not nearly as bad as the first. Since then I was okay but these last three days I keep having the same thoughts as if I'm reliving the panics to a softer degree I guess? I keep checking my pulse and my mind is racing. I've tried methods to calm myself like breathing methods, exercise and focusing on other things but it doesn't seem to work for more than a few minutes. Is there anything I can do to make this go away or be a bit less harsh? \nPS I don't have any documented anxiety disorders so I don't know if I had some form of anxiety and the edible made it worse.

I suffer from GAD, MDD and BPD and lately my moods have gotten worse. I go between extreme depression/sadness to being supper hyper and happy. I haven’t been sleeping well as of late, due to nightmares and anxious thoughts keeping me awake and my psychiatrist says “it’s probably because of your weight” my weight has never stopped me from sleeping before and it’s just been lately due to depression, sleeping schedules being off, or nightmares. Her brining up my weight unprovoked triggered me as I never saw her in person because I preferred phone call visit and she assumed it’s my weight due to me being diabetic. When I tried talking to her she cuts me off and gets right into medication and ignores anything I say. I don’t like her vibe and don’t feel comfortable with her like I did my last psychiatrist, that listened to me and made me feel comfortable with her. I told her my feelings about wanted to unalive  myself, wanted to hurt myself and the only thing she kept saying was it is my feelings of extreme anxiety and it goes away with therapy. I know how an anxiety works and never has it had me wanting to unalive myself, hurt myself and not get out of bed feeling like I can’t move nor be productive. It’s so hard to find someone that fits my first psychiatrist was a resident and left the program which I’m so sad about. I don’t know what’s going on with me but the pain is getting worse.\n\n",

Anxiety isn't being concerned generally with how the future might pan out, or being in a state of nervous anticipation of something happening.\nIt's the feeling of mortal dread, in the pit of your stomach, every day, despite no rational reasoning. It's that feeling right as the rollercoaster tips, that turns your whole body inside out. For no rational reason. It's sweating uncontrollably, twitching or itching like a mother fucker. For no apparent reason other than you're outside amongst people. It's constantly feeling like a family member is going to die every time they step out the house, despite rationally knowing it's extremely unlikely.\nIt's a chronic and very debilitating issue that no one who's had experiences with it, would describe as a normal part of life. It turns people into fantastic actors though.",

I really don’t want to share my anxiety struggles with friends. I was offered the job  and accepted but with reservations if they would come through on promises they made. It was a leap of faith and they let me down so I’m back on the job hunt. Tomorrow is my first interview and honestly I am scared.

This last week though Iv been going through severe anxiety and panic out of nowhere. I went to bed last Tuesday and just kept waking up in a panic everytime I dozed off. There was a few nights I wouldn’t wake in a panic but would just keep waking up every 30-60 minutes. Iv been able to function during the day, at times I’ll feel really tired but it passes. I figured I might just have sudden insomnia from anxiety but now I’m scaring myself it could be bipolar. Iv had low moods at times and maybe mild depression episodes but Iv never had like major depression. Curious if anyone else has felt like this and it’s just anxiety because now I’m causing more anxiety for myself which I know isn’t good lol.",

Why could they not be nice to me? \n\nWe had an online class yesterday... the same DSA professor asked a question.. I knew the answer so typed quickly in the chat box... the professor gave no response... 3 min later another student replied the same thing and she went \"Yeah abc gave the right answer\"...

I feel I have to be perfect in others eyes, the perfect friend, girlfriend, sister, daughter ect. And even to strangers. My home has to be perfectly clean and organized all the time for my sanity and to keep up with the ‘perfect’ appearance. I feel very hyper aware of people’s feelings and I get anxious if someone doesn’t seem like they like me, thus causing me to bend and shape into anything I thing the other person wants me to be lol. Typing this out is making me realize how exhausting and crazy it is that I do this! I think I’ve done it for so long it sometimes feels like second nature to me, like this is just how I am as a person and sometimes doesn’t even feel like something I need to work on until i really think about it and compare to those around me. My friends don’t care what others think of them. For example, a friend and I got invited to a dinner party. The host said it is not required to bring anything, so my friend did not. She just showed up and enjoyed herself. Me however, I spent the week stressing about making a small appetizer, and what kind of gift I would get the host for hosting. I made it so much harder for myself even though we didn’t have to bring a thing but because I wanted to be liked and thought of as I’ll just be honest, ‘better’ than the average person I put this pressure on myself to stand out. It most likely comes from a place of ego but I also truly do enjoy doing things like this and making people feel special. So that’s where it gets confusing to me. I also have an anxiety around fast food and if someone sees me eating something that’s labeled as ‘unhealthy’. Like ordering takeout or like a pizza to my door and risking a neighbor seeing me grab my takeout from the driver and going back inside is like my worst nightmare. Or going and picking up food from a fast food place gives me anxiety because I don’t want people to know I eat it. I know it sounds insane lol. One more is keeping my house clean and clutter free at all times because 1. It gives me extreme anxiety when anything is out of its place, I can’t think straight ect. And 2. I do this just in case someone knocks on my door and they for some reason have to come inside and if I have any signs of me actually living I feel embarrassed about the thought of something seeing that. If maintenance comes over I’m deep cleaning so they don’t think im a messy tenant. I’m tryingggg to work on it but I don’t think I realized just how much it affects me until I typed it out. ",

I have high blood pressure, moderately high cholesterol and am pre-diabetic.  I’m classified as overweight (not obese).  Obviously weight does factor into the 3 risk factors I have.  But I slowly stopped taking my meds over the months & years.  Reasons: sure laziness & forgetfulness, but mostly fear of going to the doctor.  And going to the doctor when you know that your BP is going to be sky high makes you want to go even less.  \n\nSo that leads to 10 days ago-I had an ischemic stroke at age 56.  BP was 260/roughly 140 when they picked me up by ambulance.  I consider myself lucky: no apparent memory or learning issues.  Some coordination issues as my eyes still react slowly to walking (I started PT today).  Thank God I have a loving wife who not only didn’t question me but has taken a considerable amount of time off work to visit me at the hospital & appointments.  I also have good insurance which is rare.\n\nNo, most of the anti depressants never really worked for me & I begrudgingly will take them now as prescribed.  But I will also always take my health meds as prescribed.  I take my blood pressure twice daily, I walk more (even if the coordination doesn’t come back) and I will continue going to PT as long as they allow or improvement shows.\n\nI guess a TLDR is: anxiety alone is bad.  Allowing it to take your health away is worse & doesn’t reduce the anxiety.",

Basically, as I'm laying in bed and closing my eyes to go to sleep, I suddenly get really anxious about falling asleep. in the sense that I get nervous about just laying down and knowing at any moment I just slip out of consciousness. obviously, when I wake up in the morning I'm fine, and I'm always glad I ended up falling asleep. I even sometimes snooze my alarm and go back to sleep with no issue. but for some reason just initially falling asleep (or the anticipation of such) has been keeping me up. recently the only way I can beat this is by just staying awake until I just pass out from exhaustion. does anyone know if this is a thing other people have dealt with and if there's a way to deal with it? I've had no issue going to bed for the last 27 years of my life and I'm not sure why this suddenly started happening. ",

Anyways, I'm here to request tips about that type of social anxiety where I'm literally incapable of not overthinking and fearing what especially women will think about how I look and all my physical complexes when approaching them. I know it's a common topic, but it's literally destroying my life to the point where I'm incapable of getting that self-confidence boost necessary to approach women. I had a girlfriend for almost 5 years, but since spring of 2022 when she dumped me I haven't dated nor chatted a single girl. I got paranoid about how I was maybe ugly or whatever, as time passes I'm tired of being incapable of meeting a girl. The only thing I see on a daily basis is the acne I've been fighting for 10 years, my physical complexes such as my big nose, my ears and the fear of having bad smells coming out of my body directly linked to OCD (bad smells, bad breath, etc.) Always been a massive over thinker but I'm tired of that mental cycle that kills all the potential I could have. I've always been a timid guys when it comes to shining out of a pack, but on 1 on 1 situations, I know I could chat if I had the confidence to love myself enough and not have all those concerns.

And of course I did need it every now and again. \n\nI wrote a bit about my flare up in a previous post so I won't go into too much about it, but I have not been good lately. \n\nI used all my Ativan before my next appointment with my psychiatrist, because I usually only get prescribed 30, with no refill, even it's four or six months between appointments. This time I used all 30 within a span of 45 days.  So obviously I am not doing as well as I am used to. \n\n\n\nI have my appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow am I'm so nervous about what's going to happen. I'm hoping she will bump up my Zoloft, or give me something to go with it. I'm scared she won't give me any Ativan to help me while I'm going through this. \n\nI trust my doctor implicitly - she's got me through 19 years of anxiety. But I can't help being scared about what's coming. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this when you know a new dose or medication is coming? What are your positive experiences with it? \n\nI just wish I could jump a year into the future and joke about how anxious I am right now, but I'm having some trouble finding the light at the end of the tunnel. Any words of wisdom are much appreciated. ",

Last couple years though, with this year since May in particular, my anxiety is at an all time extreme for how out of wack it is. \n\nSpecifically I think it’s focused on medical/health and a fixation on allergic reactions. \n\nAfter having bad reactions to a few prescriptions, I am terrified of taking anything new. I’ve had an awful relationship with food and it’s a battle every day to eat because something that was safe yesterday or this morning may make me feel off now (if this makes sense), so on and so forth.\n\nAll this to say I dyed my hair today. Was already not feeling great (see weird food bs) but pushed myself to do it anyway. Problem is, I read the dye box. I have never done a strand test before and dyed my hair off and on for like 20 years now, so theoretically I should be fine, but the more I read about it the more I learn that an allergy can pop up at any time and if you have tattoos (I do) it can make you more susceptible (this was on the box for the dye too) to a reaction. I didn’t even let the dye stay on as long as I normally would, and basically had an anxiety attack while in the shower rinsing it out. \n\nDye has been out of my hair for over 3 hours already but I’ve read some people can still get reactions as late as 6 weeks after dying their hair! So I’ve been in a state of panic for hours and just need some help outside of my own head reminding me that it’s super unlikely that anything will happen and if it does I live close to a hospital and can just go there, it will suck financially but not be the end of the world. \n\nPlease. 🙏 and thank you! 🖤🖤🖤",

The big pain and the skipped \"heartbeats\"  that goes almost for 14-16 hours sometimes every 10 seconds every day and very strong can be only from anxiety? I was feeling just fine and nothing happened to make something like this happen, i was actually happy that i was feeling good. Should i go to ER or should i wait 3 more days and go to my doctor for some more tests? They tend to stop at 7 AM and i can sleep but they keep me up all night, playing Online Chess or something that distracts me a lot seems to make them pause for couple of minutes but they always getting back (during the day they can go away for a couple of hours).\n\nHope you guys are feeling better than me atm, some opinions on this would be nice.\n\nEdit: Also didnt drink any coffe past 5 days or alcohol, i am a smoker but i didnt smoke only did some light vaping because im stress out of this condition , i took MG and all types of stuff and nothing seems to help, also my lips are a bit dry and im drinking a lot of water/tea.",

Driving in a small town was so easy and people were so polite. Now I live in a really cool place but there's more crime in more populated places. Also the driving is TERRIBLE - this city is literally in the top 3 worst places to drive. Theres a lot of rude people here, too. Then on top of everything, my best friend took her life a year ago. My anxiety is so high that I've developed depersonalization, especially in big crowds and while im driving during peak traffic. I cant escape it, either. I work events that are very partyish. Outside of my immense grief and anxiety, my career has skyrocketed since leaving my hometown. I've technically reached a huge milestone but it's like my brain is finding ways to not let myself enjoy the fruits of my labor. \n.\n\nIt's insane that I'm like this. I've gone to New York City by myself and traveled alone for 4 weeks. I've driven to Alberquerque and lived alone for an internship for a month. I used to go to huge, crowded concerts alone. I was such a badass. It was just like 1.5 years ago this started happening. I know this depersonalization is temporary and I will get through it. I just need a little support. \n\n\n\n.\nEdit: for context, I am 34. I was more of a party girl/traveler in my 20s. Maybe I've just grown out of that confidence and my energy is lower? ",

Of course the pandemic has had an effect on everybody but what I mean specifically is a sense of confusion over what is troubling them. Like I will come out of a therapy session processing things from my past and then get hit with pandemic and environmental anxieties or vice versa. I struggle more often to know if what I'm dealing with is related to personal traumas and struggles or environmental stressors. Like before the pandemic I felt like I could more clearly identify what was bugging than I have the past few years where everything just feels like a mess. I've had a lot more feelings of confusion as to what what is bothering me because there has been so much to deal with. I've found myself start to cry for one thing and before I know I'm crying about something else. Its like the rate of change of stress is harder to manage. Like I'm bailing water out of boat slower than I'm taking on water. I've been more confused, doubtful, and frustrated. I'm not only had confusion about my anxieties but have also had more anxiety/ocd doubts about the good things I do to help myself. Like before the pandemic I knew what would keep me afloat despite my struggles whereas now I feel more doubtful and second guessing the the good things I do because I can never reach pre pandemic levels of stability.\n\nThat is another thing that bugs me. During the height of the pandemic it was ok to not be ok and I didn't feel so alone and my anxieties actually calmed down when the world was going slow but ever since things opened back up my anxieties have gotten worse and I feel more left behind, alone, and confused. So many people including sometimes myself say I should be able to bounce back but I have been unable to.\n\nIs anybody else feeling this way? I'm not looking for advice as much as I just don't want to feel alone in this struggle.",

I have a half sleeve which I did in one sitting before when I was going through an anxiety relapse where I hadn’t eaten for nearly a week and I was alright. But since my most recent anxiety relapse getting a tattoo still makes me anxious however I remain anxious for too much of the process. \n\nI literally got a tattoo like 2 months ago, I got 4 pieces on my arm to start my patchwork and I’m going back in 15th to get the remaining little tattoos to finish it. Why the hell am I already nervous? I’ve done this before and my heart didn’t stop, i felt fine like i always have done with all tattoos i have ever got. How the anxiety makes me feel is worse than the needle jabbing my arm constantly and i think that’s so bizarre and I’d love to simmer it down a bit.\n\nIt’s so annoying. Any tips or rational thoughts from anyone who can look at the situation rationally?",

        "Text": "Hello. \n\nI am here because I wanted to ask others on their advice and guidance if anyone understands and is familiar with these experiences (which I'm sure many are, considering the subreddit this is going to be posted to).\n\n(Sorry, I don't know if stuff like this is overly discussed). \n\n  \nI am currently an undergrad student at university (final year). For years I have tried managing and improving my anxiety, and every time I try restructuring, it quickly reverts. \n\nThe main issue I am addressing here is my daily cycle. I become very anxious about working and procrastinate a lot. Sometimes I am very anxious and become sort of paralysed, where I am very shaky and find it hard to breathe. My work and other chores only get done when I get to a point when it is too late and the work HAS to be done (like just before a deadline, or doing reading at 2am). And then when I put myself to bed, I procrastinate sleeping as well, because I know I'll just be stuck with my anxiety filled thoughts, guilty and annoyed that I went to bed late, and will be very tired the next day. Then the next day comes around and of course I am very very tired, and had to wake up later then I always want to because I'm too tired. Then again, I spend a while procrastinating getting up and starting my day of duties, and the cycle continues.   \n  \nThese kind of feelings are pretty normal for me during this time of year. Anxiety, has been something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember (got diagnosed with ASD a few years ago), and even sought help through counselling, forms of meditation, and medication. But I cannot seem to shake this cycle, these feeling... I feel like I cannot improve and feel so much guilt every time I cannot keep up with plans to improve (medication or advice) so will just avoid it often. And I only really address these feelings when I am at my lowest, like now, because when I am generally calm I don't want to think about addressing these issues, it would mean I would lose that moment of calmness. \n\n  \nTo sort of deal with this, I have made myself super busy with activities and clubs at uni, which I love, but I know a big reason I do them is to give myself a break and not stress like crazy for a bit of time. There are times when I know I don't really feel like going out and doing a club activity and would much rather stay at home, but I still go because I'd rather that than dealing with my anxiety in my head. I also started using more instant ways of silencing the rampant thoughts through certain substances (not sure if I can specify here, but nothing dangerous), which I am nervous might be turning into a dependence. \n\n  \nI worry that this will never go away, I don't want to live with it for the rest of my life. Although I am aware anxiety will never truly go away, it would be nice for it to not run my life. And I just want to say I am very happy with my life, all I want is to live it as best as I can, I will never give up on this life. \n\n\n\nSo, I just want to see if anyone has advice. I appreciate that improving upon this will not be quick or easy. And I may not be great at maintaining plans of management, but I want to keep attempting. \n\nThank you. ",

My anxiety was so bad I was I had a hard time functioning. I had to force myself to go to the gym, go to work and just trying to get the day over with. My heart would sometimes palpitate, and I was constantly breathing through my mouth not to mention that I have slight Gerd.  I said the hell with it and reached out to a therapist. She put me on this medicine clonidine which I have been on for 3 weeks and I'm not sure its working. Im still having anxiety but not really having panic attacks. I thought I be feeling somewhat normal but as I'm writing this, I'm having anxiety at the moment. I'm 6' 230 lbs. should I be taking more? She also gave me hydroxine in case I need it. That seems to work better but I don't want to depend on this medicine. My story is I never experienced anxiety until 5 years ago when I was at the gym and my heart went into afib. I thought I was going to die because I had no idea what it was. I seemed to have controlled it, but it just overtakes me, and I feel so week mentally. Flashforward my cardiologist has the AFIB under control but I'm always thinking about that trigger and how profound it was for me. Now, with everything going on in my life I hate feeling this way and maybe its health anxiety, but does anyone have any experience with this medication, and could you offer me some advice how to not think about it, sorry for venting but I have no one else who seems to want to help me. ps. when I see my therapist she just talks about current events which i don't care for.

I went to the ER a few days ago to get some scans after I had a panic attack because I couldn’t remember things at work and felt ‘off.’ My CT showed up clear which is a good sign but once I was laying down I experienced vertigo for the first time in my life which was very strange. I have a follow up appointment on the 22nd of this month with a neurologist but with college commitments piling up, it feels like I am drowning in anxiety about my ability to perform academically and my physical health. I feel so disoriented and unable to complete basic tasks such as simple conversation much less exams or formal presentations. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend, probably my biggest emotional supporter, broke up with me 5 days ago. I feel so overwhelmed by everything that is happening and with a weakened support system, I feel incredibly alone. I guess I am looking for suggestions on how to combat this anxiety for the next week + if anyone has experienced these physical symptoms before I’d love some advice.",

As the result I really had no response and the conversation more or less got left there as I am quite avoidant. TLDR of it is that I've never been good at standing up for myself since I was a kid but now more than ever I realize I can't even identify how I feel to begin to confidently articulate it and my gravitation is always towards freezing.

Every other room of my house is immaculate: clean, organised and tidy but it's like this job has become so big that it feels so overwhelming and daunting. In truth, it would probably only take a few hours to organise the clothes again and put them away but I cannot bring myself to do it. It's making me anxious and I feel like a failure because of it. \n\nI have asked my partner if he will help me with it and he acts like I am being crazy - 'it's just clothes, stop being dramatic'. He even puts his own clothes away in the wardrobe around mine and still won't help. I don't even necessarily need him to tidy them away, I think I just want him in the room with me whilst I do it. I'd ask a friend but I am embarrassed of the room now and don't want people in there. FYI the room isn't dirty, just messy with clothes and things.\n\nNever in my life have I had a job make me feel this way. In fact, I'll put time aside at the weekend to do it and instead I will clean all the cupboards in the kitchen or do DIY, paint walls and hang pictures etc. These are far more challenging tasks so I cannot figure out why I cannot do this. It's almost like I am blowing it up in my head and now I am stuck.\n\nPlease, has anyone experienced this. I know many of you are probably thinking 'just tidy the room' but if it was that easy I would have done it by now. I feel like a prize idiot but I am stressing. I am very house proud so this is just another anxiety to add to my list. Any advice would be greatly appreciated x\n",

Went through tons of traditional testing with no major findings. Kind of just accepted it and since then I've had the symptoms at varying levels over the years. Stomach issues, light sensitivity, zoning out, concentration issues, pressure behind my eyes and around my ears/jaw., palpitations. They would vary in severity but always kind of there and never went away fully and couldn't help but think there was something more going on.\n\n  \nRecently I had extensive bloodwork done  to check biomarkers and overall health and almost all of my thyroid markers seem to be either borderline or out of normal range indicating possible hyperthyroid. After doing research it seems like there's a lot of overlap between thyroid issues and anxiety (and a lot of other bodily functions for that matter) and my symptoms seem to overlap both\n\nJust want to hear what people's experience with this is. Thanks in advance\n\n",

        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "Hi everyone. I haven’t had a panic attack in weeks. My first one was in June, and I thought it was a heart attack. After that, I mostly had “mild” attacks, but there was a period where they happened daily, and I really hit rock bottom. I didn’t leave the house. Now, for the past two months, things have been going well, except for hives, stomach issues, and heart palpitations. But mentally, I actually feel okay otherwise.\n\nTwo days ago, I was in line at the airport to board, and just before that, I had messaged my friend saying how well I was doing and that I hadn’t had any panic attacks in weeks. And of course… while in line, I suddenly felt a kind of cramp in the chest area and immediately felt short of breath, and then I broke out in a sweat. I also felt a bit lightheaded. The cramp or pain subsided within a minute. I still felt a bit short of breath and very anxious afterward. About 10 minutes later, it happened again but to a lesser degree. Then on the plane, I felt uncomfortable for at least 45 more minutes. There wasn’t any more cramp or pain, but I ended up back in a negative cycle, thinking something might be wrong with my heart. That’s one of my biggest issues: health anxiety.\n\nI had an ECG done, and everything looked fine; there were two PVCs (palpitations) seen, but according to my doctor, that’s nothing serious and is caused by stress. I have an appointment with her on Tuesday for my hives, and I’m going to bring this up and ask for another heart echo to hopefully reassure myself.\n\nBut my question to you all is: does anyone else recognize this kind of cramp-like feeling in the chest? That comes out of nowhere and it really surprises you in a way. It goes away quickly but happens with shortness of breath and other symptoms. I find it so hard sometimes to recognize a panic attack.",

Spent some time in a psych ward and did not sleep for like 2 weeks straight and tried all sorts of drugs but now I've been awesome for a few years :) I am just posting because I remember people asking where are all the recovered people? They do exist they just don't come back and post in Anxiety :) \n\nI tried all sorts of drugs but eventually the thing that helped me was Quetiapine initially to allow me to sleep and relax and then I went on the supplements big time. Make sure your nervous system is healthy. You are made up a of chemicals and your body needs the right chemicals to function. I took Multilvitamins and extra vit D and C. Its a long journey out of anxiety but it can happen! now I am having a great time. Met a new girl and saving up to buy land and look at growing Shrimp in north east Thailand one day :D ",

This lasts for months and usually wears me down until I reach a breaking point. Every interaction with people feels forced and unnatural. I just don't know what to say, how to care about anything. I am so self concious. The original anxiety source is now not even the main problem, the main problem is I can't think or act or feel normal. I try meditating, exercising, reframing thoughts, positive thinking. But I can't escape it unless I just quit everything which I have done several times in the past but it's obviously not a healthy coping mechanism.

The situation is that I have to interview a stakeholder in the food business but I don't have any family or friends that work in the food industry so I will for sure going to interview strangers. It's...hard to ask some random person for a interview, especially when I will be doing the interview during their work hours most likely. What if they get pissed off at me? What if they're too busy?

I had to go to the ER at one point because I had convinced myself nothing was real and couldn't calm myself down. They put me on zoloft and fast forward a few months i'm doing pretty good actually. Recently I have been pretty stressed, a few changed have happened in my life and change is one of my main triggers for my anxiety. I started feeling extremely anxious after I woke up a few moments ago. I haven't felt anxious this way since summer and I think feeling anxious like this brought back so many horrible memories that it made everything 100x worse. I feel I managed to make a huge deal out of something small. I hate that anxiety makes me think the worst thoughts and makes me feel things that i feel like are out of my control. This has been very discouraging and I know that I will always experience anxiety and no amount of medication will change that but dang is this scary. I feel like I will never know what it is to be normal. Could really use some support right now. Hope you guys have a goodnight. ",

        "Text": "Hello all.\n\nJust wanted to share.  I developed anxiety after a nervous breakdown at 25. I'm 44.\n\nI read your posts and have compassion for the suffering you feel.\n\nMy anxiety started with panic attacks and gad. Its progressed, since Covid, to social anxiety.\n\nI knew that i needed new tools and a lifestyle change.\n\nSo, two tools i highly recommend (plus diet, exercise and hobbies):\n\n**Wheel of Awareness meditation - Dan Siegel.**  \n\nExplanation:  I do the 30 minute version on his website.  There is research to back up this meditation.  It involves the visual image of a wheel, with a hub at the centre.  It covers the five senses, interior of the body, mental activities and interconnectedness (compassion) and awareness itself at the centre.  \n\nHow it helps anxiety:  my experience is, it helps to create awareness and space of the bodily and mental things going on in me.  It gives me space, so i'm not overwhelmed.\n\nAn example.  I got shouted at by my boss in front of the office.  Social anxiety really kicked in.  I felt like crying. I sat with it and felt it in my body.  My chest pounding with fear and wanting to leave.  Heat in my face, burning from shame. Hot tears wanting to come.  It moved down to my stomach, where i felt shame, then anger in the pit of my stomach.  Once i'd sat with these, i realised anger wanted me to be assertive and set boundaries.  \n\nActually, i cared more about what was going on within me and attending to it, than other people's thoughts about me. I also realised i can't assume others are thinking negatively about me, it feels real but i can't be sure its true.  Even if they were, these aren't the kind of people whose opinions i care about.  \n\n**RAIN by Tara Brach.**\n\nExplanation:  This is a meditation but i use it mostly for in the moment.  \n\nR - Recognise whats going on.  What is happening inside me right now.\n\nA - Allow the experience to be there.  Allowing means letting the thoughts or sensations to be there without trying to fix or avoid.  I usually say, yes, its here, its ok.\n\nI - Investigate.  How does thing feel in body right now?  What am i believing?  What does this vulnerable place need?\n\nN - Nurture.  Nurture with self- compassion.  I'm listening and i care.I'm sorry you're going through this. Who are you when you aren't caught in this emotion?\n\nAn example.  When i'm attracted to someone, i freeze around them.  I recognise i'm freezing and feeling anxious.  I allow it to be there, saying to myself its here, its ok.  Then, i investigate.  What it happening in my body?  Jumpiness, rigidity, chaos of thoughts.I'm believing i'm weird.  I feel shame. What does this place need?  To know i'm good enough, to be calmed and recognise that this is hard. Nurture - i tell myself this is hard and i care about the suffering, i don't have to believe the story of not good enough / weird.  \n\nIn addition, I've made lifestyle changes. I go to bed earlier, do slow yin yoga, go swimming, rarely have caffeine, use kettle bells and have hobbies i enjoy.  I eat whole food, every 3-4 hours, as it lowers cortisol.  I also use a shiatsu hand-held electric massager, as it relaxes the anxiety-induced tension, daily. \n\nI have a very scared and ashamed part of me and believe self-compassion, mindfulness and looking after my body are keys to looking after it.\n\nI hope this helps someone.  Sorry it was a bit long.",

I cannot get a therapist right now because this issue is insurance related so I have been calling crisis lines and warmlines.

I know these things take time and phonecalls but having this anxiety roller coaster on top makes everything worse.\n\nI’m trying breathing exercises, ground techniques, long walks, and that can help me slowly bring my anxiety level from an 8 down below 5. Sometimes I get relief where the anxiety is just gone for an hour. Then it returns again: worry, ruminating, catastrophizing.\n\nI want to learn more about somatic movement.

I had to call 911, crying the whole way feeling like I was going to faint with my heart racing, was in the ER they said it was indeed a panick attack and gave me a few options such was taking clonazepam only when needed. I’ve had it before it’s helpful to sleep for sure and will calm you down, have been stressed.. I beg god to cure my anxiety and panic attacks they are terrible lately. My dad passed away, and earlier while I was riding the ambulance I was so emotional about that, I wanted to see him, and it hit me so bad that he isn’t here. :( but everything triggers me.. if I’m working and I see to many people it triggers anxiety, everything triggers me… I feel exhausted but I hope I’m not alone being taken to the ER was embarrassing for me.. I feel dramatic and exaggerated, I want this to stop. 😔 like earlier I was cutting hot dogs to fry them and they opened up and it triggered me and made me uncomfortable because it reminded me of the cuts on my arm, I felt disgusted idk why this happens. 🥲🥲",

My symptoms that made them prescribe the medication were tachycardia (specifically when standing/walking around) and chest pains. My labeled dose is a 10mg tablet twice a day but my doctor said I could do 5mg twice a day to see how that works for me and in all honesty, it's working magnificently.\n\nI don't know if this medication at this low of a dose is purely placebo or if it's actually doing the job. I have horrific health anxiety (during my first onset of symptoms, I ended up in the ER 4 times thinking I was about to keel over from a heart attack) and I've had lots of good days when I started it but also some bad days. My chest pain still comes and goes after walking around quite a bit (especially after a 10 hour shift) but otherwise my heartrate has been pretty normal.\n\nI trained myself to not obsessively look at my heart rate on my apple watch and it's definitely helped but that fear is still lingering in the back of my mind. Is this medication purely placebo at this dose? If anyone else is on this low of a dose, does it help you as well? I'm new to these medications so I'm in the blue, even after going to Dr. Google about it.\n\nside note, I also have asthma (was worse in my childhood years but I still use my inhaler once or twice a month) and I also vape on the daily. After reading about it, it sounds like people have had it worsen it? If so, how bad? I've had mild coughing fits since starting the meds but nothing too horrible.",

I haven't picked the book up again for days because of the weird way my body react to reading it",

Its not procrastination since I much rather get the task/event over with as soon as possible but I will not leave my mind and will work about it until it happens. Its especially hard when you can do it asap (like something can only be done at a certain time or is dependent on someone or group to be done). I can range from just waiting until shower time in the evening or having to get up for work/school/errand the following morning or even afternoon. To maybe short term like back during k-12 school worrying about Monday before the Friday school day has ended. To back in High school in the mid 2010s about worrying about the class project at the start of the semester, even though it does not even start until a few months latter. To working about maybe a class in some cases years in advance (Like me worrying when starting college in the late 2010s for a internship I did not have to do until the early 2020s). I cant take a break of work since my mind will still be on that task until it happens or another worry comes up that over takes it so there is no point in resting.",

        "Text": "Between last night and this morning I've felt quite a bit of anxiety and am not sure why (I have a good feeling it's healthy anxiety). I decided to journal about it and I asked ChatGPT to give me some journaling prompts. I was thoroughly impressed by the output and hope they may help others as they have helped me:\n\n\\---\n\nHere are some journaling prompts specifically tailored for moments when you feel anxiety without a clear reason. These prompts are designed to help you explore your feelings, uncover hidden triggers, and process your emotions in a productive way:\n\n\n\n\\### 1. \\*\\*Mind-Body Connection Check-In\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"What physical sensations am I experiencing right now, and how do they make me feel emotionally?\"\n\n\\- \"If my body could speak, what would it be trying to tell me?\"\n\n\n\nThis prompt helps you tune into your body, which can often hold tension or discomfort that manifests as anxiety.\n\n\n\n\\### 2. \\*\\*Naming the Unknown\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"If I had to guess, what might my anxiety be trying to protect me from right now?\"\n\n\\- \"What is something I’ve been avoiding thinking about or addressing lately?\"\n\n\n\nThis prompt helps give a name or shape to vague fears or concerns.\n\n\n\n\\### 3. \\*\\*Safe Space Visualization\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"Close your eyes and imagine a place where you feel completely safe and at peace. Describe it in detail. How does your body feel in this place?\"\n\n\\- \"How can I bring elements of this safe space into my current reality?\"\n\n\n\nThis can help ground you by creating a mental escape and giving your anxiety a soothing image.\n\n\n\n\\### 4. \\*\\*Unspoken Thoughts\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"What is something I want to say out loud but feel like I can’t?\"\n\n\\- \"What am I afraid might happen if I say what I truly feel?\"\n\n\n\nAnxiety often builds when we hold back thoughts or emotions we think are unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\\### 5. \\*\\*The ‘Why’ Ladder\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"What am I feeling anxious about right now? And why?\"\n\n  \\- Follow up with: \"And why does that matter to me?\" Keep asking \"Why?\" until you reach a deeper understanding.\n\n\n\nThis technique can help you drill down from surface-level anxiety to the root cause.\n\n\n\n\\### 6. \\*\\*Self-Compassion Check-In\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"If I were comforting a friend feeling this exact way, what would I say to them right now?\"\n\n\\- \"What would be the kindest thing I could do for myself at this moment?\"\n\n\n\nThis prompt shifts the focus from self-criticism to self-compassion.\n\n\n\n\\### 7. \\*\\*Reframing Fears\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"What is the worst-case scenario I’m imagining? How realistic is it, and what could I do if it actually happened?\"\n\n\\- \"What is the best-case scenario, and how would I handle that?\"\n\n\n\nThis prompt helps you acknowledge fears while also considering positive or neutral outcomes.\n\n\n\n\\### 8. \\*\\*A Letter to My Anxiety\\*\\*\n\n\\- \"Write a letter to your anxiety as if it were a person. What would you say to it? What would you ask?\"\n\n\\- \"How might your anxiety respond if it could write back?\"",

I’m sure this is the career I want, but I’ve realized I have a deep discomfort with needles—especially when it comes to self-injections. While I’m okay with someone else drawing my blood or giving me a vaccine, the idea of injecting myself, like my recent dose of Ozempic, triggered intense anxiety. I couldn’t bring myself to do it, and ended up asking my roommate to inject it for me. I realized a lot of the anxiety is coming from the fact that I HAVE to do something, as if I’m getting blood drawn by a medical professional. I’m more able to self regulate because I know they know what they’re doing.\n\n\nToday was a wake-up call, and it has me worried that this fear might impact my career. I suspect it started from a bad experience at a clinic where a nurse struggled to find my vein and eventually suggested trying my hand, which felt uncomfortable and unprofessional. I’m determined to work through this and want to know if therapists specialize in needle phobias. Should I reach out to my doctor for guidance, or are there online resources I could explore on my own?",

My roommate’s are all willing to share and that’s what makes it worse cause I feel like I’m never as generous as they are. For example, if we make dinner together they will provide most of the ingredients from things they have/need to use. All of the things I buy from the store I use and save for meals throughout the week. So if we used my ingredients, I would get panicky and feel like I’m wasting money and will run out of food. The reality is that I can always buy more food, and though money is tight, I do have enough to share. But I can’t make my body believe that. I try to convince myself that it’s ok to share or tell them they can use my stuff but when I do do that I get so anxious and feel like I’m going to cry. I also start resenting them for taking my stuff even though I offered. I think I’d prefer to just keep things to myself but then I’m a hypocrite cause I take their food when they offer. I just wish I didn’t mind as much. The same thing happens at restaurants when we order food to share. I’m always worried there won’t be enough and I get so stressed paying for things I didn’t eat.

I’m so terrified of needles and any sort of procedure you might have done without sedation and I’ve had a really rough month. 2 weeks ago I sliced my finger open and needed stitches but I was flinching so bad with the lidocaine needle that they couldn’t numb me and I had to get the stitches without it. The very next day I had to have 3 moles removed and that was way better than the stitches but was still just layering trauma on top of trauma, and then the NEXT day I found out that I need to get a lump on my thyroid biopsied by Fine Needle Aspiration. I am so terrified of having this done that I can’t make the appointment. We are talking possible cancer here and I’m not scared of that, but the biopsy makes me so sick to my stomach that every time I call I feel like throwing up and I hang up the phone while I’m on hold, before they can even take my name. Why can’t my brain prioritize things like “this needle won’t kill you but cancer can so get the biopsy!” everything I read about it says there might be “pressure” or “discomfort” and I feel like they are being dishonest, there’s no sedation so how could it not hurt? I’m in my 40s, I should be able to handle this and I can’t. There’s just no way I can. I don’t even know what I’m getting out of posting this here but just thinking about it makes me cry so… idk.

I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. I also have developmental trauma, and I was made aware that I have trauma by my psychologist.\n\nThe last two weeks I was in a depressive episode (I didn't realize until my psychologist mentioned it actually, but I was incredibly down). Then, in the midst of it I had a health emergency (maybe related who knows). Now, I am coming out of it and finding myself very anxious about the sensations I feel in my body post-health-issue and the food anxiety has started again. I ordered my groceries for delivery and now I'm concerned my pack of water is poisoned and it is making me anxious. I'm thirsty, but I can't bring myself to drink it and I can't drink tap water because I ALSO think that's gonna kill me (I am a mess). \n\nHow does anyone, OCD, anxious, etc. deal with this when there's no way to say \"the water isn't poisoned\" without drinking it?

Then I lost my marbles and sent voice messages. Poof ignored me.\n\nRecently also lost friend cause he told me one day out of blue that his mom thinks Im using him for driving me. So he believed his mom?  He told me it is ok and I always vrought him gifts. \nHe told me why is grown woman not able to drive herself?\nI just blocked him because he knows I'm disabled and he knows I'm not woman, but non binary.  \nHe acted like I am less because I can't drive. \nI have car but I got dissociative episode on road once and since then I avoid driving on fast roads.\n\nI feel so lonely, I couldn't tell it to him. I can't tell this to my mom. \nEverytime I tell big stuff she says she's sorry but she never kniws how to help.\n\nI don’t have other family members that I am close to.\n\nI know they're not my real friends but for 3 or 5 years they were and grieving is hard. I don't care about you know loosing. But the SAME AND HUMILIATION HURT. BETRAYAL.\n\n\nI struggle with depression,  concentration,  low motivation,  agitation and explodive anger, self harm ( head banging) when I am in episode. \n\nIm not suicidal. I am in therapy. I don't need family, kids, lovers, I have gosls that are taken from me and I'm workimg my ass to get there.\n\nBut i am FRUSTRATED.

My gaslightings betraying ex, my mistakes from that relationship,  my broken heart, his contempt,  my ex friends,  laundry, dishes, my body that needs physio therapy. \nI need my life back😫 Im so messed up, while I was healthy mother never supported my dream to study art.

I don't need anything else. I just want to be able to feel motivation and not struggle to force myself to do anything even stuff I love.\nWhy can't I respawn?

We are both late bloomers in life, so I have tried to be patient with her but her anxiety has gotten to a severe state imo. She is very uncomfortable shopping alone or going almost anywhere alone that involves her leaving the car. \n\nI have been able to deal with those things for the past 3-4 years, but my sanity has hit a breaking point since she left her most recent job over her anxiety because she felt she was the worst worker there and had little privacy (she worked there for 3 weeks). She has a history of getting fed up with jobs and leaving before getting another job lined up and then she procrastinates on getting a new one due to her social anxiety. Her dream is to work from home and work for herself but I have doubts about that happening since she can't ensure interviewing much.\n  \nI am a bit sympathetic to her struggles, but at the same time, I just worry I am enabling her like a parent would. She hasn't embraced adulthood like I expected at her age and it is difficult to get her to follow through on things as she tends to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. \n  \nI have strongly urged her to try therapy again, but she has had a bad experience with it. I even offered to go with her for the first few sessions (yes it would be a hit to our HSA but it would be worth it imo). She is also reluctant to go on any meds as the last ones she tried didn't help (I tried to explain she needs to try more than just 1). She will work for maybe 8 months to a year and then burn out. Quit. Take a break for however long she wants, until it hits a boiling point.\n  \nI have tried putting my foot down in the past about her not working or going to to therapy but it just has led to her threatening to go live with her dad for a while, or she accuses me of wanting a divorce. It is exhausting tbh. She often repeats that she would rather be dead than have to work the rest of her life (yes, I explained how unfair that is to me to have to hold the fort down financially and I am done explaining it to her. I want to be able to save more and pay down the house sooner than later)\n  \nShe believes her disorders make it difficult for her to consistently work and that I should be more supportive at times. It has left me a bit resentful but I think getting her to at least therapy and on some meds could help her get past this. \n\nSorry for the long post and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this novel.\n\nTLDR: Wife's anxiety is preventing her from doing everyday adult things like working and it is straining our marriage. Any advice here would be helpful.",

        "Text": "Hello all, \nA little bit of background: 24 years old, 165ib.\n\nI'm at a lost for what's going in my body. I've been to almost every medical professional,  and it's all the same story: everything comes back normal and I'm fine.\n\nLong story short, my heart seems to become tachycardiac randomly. Most of the time, honestly, almost all of the time, it happens when it starts to become night. About two to three weeks ago, I went to the ER because my heart rate was in the 120s-130s and would not calm down. They have me a dose of hydroxyzine and it still didn't do anything. Then they gave me metoprolol and it calmed right now. Since then I've been taking metoprolol, the beta blocker. Honestly, it's been a blessing too, because I don't get pvcs as much anymore--- unless my heart is racing. It also lowered my heart to a 65 which felt so amazing. Before that, it was always elevated, my normal was around 90 resting.  During that ER setting, all results came back normal. Normal xray. Normal blood panel. Normal EKG. Just tachycardia. I'm relieved obviously. But still, just frustrated why so randomly this happens. \n\nLast night, my heart rate was above 100 again, and I went to the ER. They literally know me by name now. Once again, everything came back normal and I'm completely fine. \n\nNow tonight, my heart is slightly taking off, but I just took some hydroxyzine in hopes of calming it down. I don't want to test my heart rate ATM. \n\nIve been trying to heal and get past a lot of things, but this heart thing is really bothering me. Im so tired of feeling on edge when my heart just takes off like it has been. My cardiologist said that because it's just tachycardia,  it's pointing away from it being anything to do with the heart, given back all the results.  \n\nI'm glad my heart is structurally fine. I'm just feeling so trapped, I feel like it's ruining my life-- and it is to be honest. \n\nWhen it happens, I'm literally doing nothing anxiety provoking. There were times I could be having fun with friends and BOOM. There is goes.   I know it starts to happen because of a weird stressing feeling in the lower middle of chest-- it's like a nervous feeling. \n\n... is that anxiety? I mean, I just can't believe it would pop out of no where, without any trigger. This last for like hours, tbh. I thought anxiety was just a, you feel it for 30 minutes at most, but otherwise,  it slowly fades away-- not a constant thing of every second. \n\nI'm feeling so trapped, and I hate going to the ER around 3-4 times a month. I just want to live my life and not have to worry about all of this. .... I don't know what to do at this point. I'm so tired of all of this, and I've honestly been feeling like I'm about to croak anytime due to how uncomfortable these feelings are. \n\nPlease help. As much as you can. ",

So I slowly upped back to 12.5mg, 25mg and now I'm 3 weeks in on 50mg (my dose for years with exception of a few meltdowns when I had to bump up to 75 and 100). \n\nI know that the sides all come back around when you increase dose. But OMFG how I am exhausted. I have hit all the side effects of an SSRI onboarding - tummy yuck, nausea and anorexia, headaches, just buzzing nervous system, derealization, the fucking insomnia! \n\nNow at the start of 4th week, they seem to all dissipate, only to be replaced by feeling like absolute shit most of the time. My anxiety and OCD have been, thankfully, lessened and apparently that just makes way for crying spells. I'm trying to be very strong for my 2 kids who are little, and my partner who doesn't relate although tries to be supportive, but I'm just so exhausted of fighting this uphill battle daily and just not knowing who I even am anymore. \n\nI guess I am wondering if you have similar experiences - I know it's supposed to get better with more time, but if this is my life now - feeling 80% shit and 20% marginally less shit, then it's a bit bleak to be honest.

Did an EKG during the episode and it was ok, then blood tests, then thyroid test, then echocardiogram, 24h monitor, all perfectly fine. So I was told it’s probably stress/anxiety. That was in the end o September and I’ve just had 2 or 3 more episodes since then and was able to control it either with the propanolol 10mg they gave me or just with breathing. I’m only 20 and don’t have a disease history in my family so I’m probably ok. The symptoms have pretty much gone away lately, some days they happen but I’ve been able to control. But now I felt dizzy/fainty/lightheaded a few times in the past days and I got so worried and thought maybe I should go to the doctor and try to get brain tests.\n\nDeep down I feel I’m just exaggerating again but I kinda need to hear it from someone else",

Because it's been hard to talk to these people. Been speaking to them off and on for 2 weeks. The interview is in 2 days and I'm dreading it. I am about to skip it. I have a horrible feeling about it and I am just debating on saying screw it. The thought of it makes me so anxious. \n\nI literally only have enough energy to care for myself and my child. I speak to my husband and that recharges my internal battery.. But everything else is exhausting. I have PTSD and obviously haven't been caring for my mental health if I'm this burnt out.

Before, a panic attack would have me going to the hospital, even calling an ambulance once or twice, but hydroxyzine and coping skills are keeping me stable, kind of?

She just turned 20 years old and already has conditions like hypothyroidism, was prediabetic(idk if she still is), and possibly atrial fibrillation but doing more tests. I love her so much and I just want the best for her and to be able to make her own choices of course but I can’t help but worry A LOT about her. She used to drink like 1-2 energy drinks a day and now she definitely has improved that in terms of not drinking energy drinks every day but there are not many days where she hasn’t drank either energy drink, soda, or coffee (she only drinks white coffee). That is like rare. Usually most of the days it’s either her white coffee drink she gets from Dutch bros or an energy drink (Red Bull, Yerba mates, Dutch bros/ or Starbucks). Idk if I’m over worrying this and maybe it’s something to not really be concerned about. I think it’s also the fact that she has other conditions and experiences symptoms on a daily (frequent episodes of shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, fatigue/tirsd etc). Even when she does drink an energy drink or something with caffeine it doesn’t really improve her fatigue or energy levels that much anyways. She has drank an energy drink and fell asleep before. She sometimes drinks matcha and she says she is trying to get into drinking matcha but I don’t see much change for that. She also has a pretty seredetery lifestyle. I am not trying to “attack” or judge her in anyway. This is just me worried about her and I love her so much. My greatest fear is losing her. I have expressed my worries to her before and she thinks I’m over worrying, even her parents are slightly worried but not that much as they still continue to buy her those things. I just don’t know how to go about this and I definitely do not want to “control” her in any way, I am just very worried and I don’t know if I am over worrying. Idk if anyone has any suggestions, a different perspective, or can relate in some way? ",

Usually during my anxiety- or panic bouts I experience this sensation that I can only describe as dizziness or lightheadedness, but I'm not *actually* dizzy or lightheaded. I'm just perceiving this sensation as dizziness. Like my nervous system is just firing blanks in its hyper-alert state and I end up with this placeholder-symptom that's not actually real.\n\nSame with shortness of breath. I never actually experience any trouble breathing or anything, but I get this weird sensation that my body perceives as shortness of breath even though it's not actually there. It's so weird and so exhausting. The worst part is that these symptoms always scare the bejesus out of me, even though they never hinder my physical functionality in any way like the real symptoms would.

The doctors thing is something I was thinking of posting/seeking advice/help on last night, the coffee thing is like a rn thing loll\n\nCoffee first. I’m a senior in highschool, two years ago was first time I started drinking soda, not for caffeine purposes but sometimes rarely yes for the caffeine. Then since start of this year idk why it’s just been horrible. Usually I’m wide awake all the time but the start of this year I’ve been having a hard time focusing and frickin idk what’s wrong with me. I’ve gone from rarely sleeping to now I can hardly get through the school day without sleeping in at least one class. So I’ve tried drinking coffee a few times, I don’t really like the taste but I though screw it it can help. It never helped, Starbucks, etc. I’d drink pumpkin spice lattes (because I’m basic lol) and i really didn’t feel anything lmao so I thought “oh coffee sucks, tastes bad and doesn’t help”. Today I was again having trouble with focus and I have school crap to do that I haven’t been doing. I was also feeling kinda sad ngl, I went to the gas station thinking of trying cigarettes or whatever (I know very fucking stupid I’m not gonna do that), realized I can’t buy cigarettes got coffee instead not thinking much about it. HOLY SHIT. Idk why but this shit is like so fucking strong, I didn’t even drink all of it. My fingers are shaking, my heart is beating, and now I can’t focus because instead of wanting to stay in bed and like disappear now I feel like I’m going to have a fucking heart attack good fucking lord lmaoo. I hate this, wtf is in gas station coffee. Idk if this is anxiety I just didn’t know where to post this lol, okay now to the second part which is genuinely anxiety.\n\nDoctors. I just turned 18, I have not been to the doctor since I was like 10. I always hated going to the doctor as a kid, always was nervous and anxious to go y’know? And when I was around 10 my doctor was arrested (for things they did to other patients, they didnt do anything to me) and since I dont really have medical issues and was always scared of the doctor I didn’t really ever ask to go, but I realize that im pretty sure most kids go like every year or more (maybe my friends just get sick a lot idk). Anyway last night my mom just sprang on me that I need to get a physical exam soon and it’s been really freaking me out (even before the coffee lol) like idk, I never liked going to the doctor and basically I know you should go so in my head I was planning to go to my first doctor visit after graduating college and dragging a friend or something so I would be less nervous or something idk. I just, I don’t wanna go but I know that’s also fucking childish as shit. Idk im just scared of doctors because of several reasons. 1, im scared of like being told “hey bro you’re weird, why tf do you do that it’ll kill you” 2, wow you’re really unhealthy or like overweight, shame on you 3, there’s nothing wrong with you or you’re overreacting to shit stfu.\nIdk how doctor visits are even like y’know, I haven’t been in basically a decade. I’ve also never gotten blood drawn and that seems scary as heck too but I know I probably should. I don’t even know who my doctor technically is rn lmao idk the whole thing scares me but I also feel like “hey man you’re an adult this shit shouldn’t fucking bother you, what are you ten?” But then I counter that with “well I haven’t been since I was like ten so I might as well be at that fuckin point” idk, how do people go to the doctor. Im not like dying (I don’t think) so why do I need to go? Idk how do I deal with this anxiety. One answer im not gonna drink coffee from a gas station again lmao.",

I have a PhD, and am working in (what should be) a low stress, great paying job since, but I have lived so long with my anxiety that I cannot turn off the constant worrying, constant sinking feeling, pit in my stomach, crying in fear of getting fired / messing up / etc. I always assumed once school stopped I would relax, but I have tried therapy for years and it provided minimal relief, and feel that I am still in the same position. I have always been weary of medication (specifically SSRI’s) but I feel that I am at the end of my rope with options and will try anything at this point to feel relief. \n\nMy doctor recommended buspirone (10mg twice daily) and it has been 2 weeks and I don’t feel different. Maybe it’s my expectations or not knowing how “normal” feels, but how do I know these meds are working or not? I cannot fathom how these meds are supposed to make me think differently or feel less stressed when I can’t remember a time in my life where I wasn’t. \n\n For people who are on this med or other anti-anxiety meds, how did you know the meds you were on were the right choice and worked? Has anyone who dealt with long term anxiety feel that their anxiety is gone? Thank you ",

        "Text": "I hope this is a post that falls in the anxiety category. \n\nI know better than anyone that relationships are mirrors, and that your significant other is more often than not going to reflect your unfavorable qualities back to you which in turn helps us become aware of them.\n\nI have struggled with receiving constructive criticism for most of my life. Recently I have been consciously trying to work on this by trying to modify this while at work. I know that receiving constructive criticism at work is only to help me be better at my job, so it should be the same in my relationships. \n\nWhile spending time with my significant other this weekend, I started becoming painfully aware of this poor quality I have as well as my unfavorable quality of talking over people or making something they share immediately about me by trying to relate, which can be damaging in communication within relationships. \n\nI really want to modify this behavior as it brings up a lot of anxiety and fear-based abandonment issues in previous relationships where previous partners or friends have shared they find it hard to communicate criticisms to me without fear of me responding poorly via getting emotional and upset, freezing up, and becoming silent when I’m normally talkative with my SO as he is 100% my best friend. \n\nTo clarify, he’s very patient and supportive and I’ve been trying to be better at least about communicating that I’ve been ruminating on all of these poor qualities of mine and honestly wondering why he loves me at all. I know nobody is perfect and that we all have unfavorable traits and qualities that contribute to the beautiful wholeness of who we are, but this is something I’d really like to change. \n\nIf anyone has helpful tips I’m very open to hearing anything helpful. \nNot that this matters a whole lot, but I also work in mental health and have been in therapy for many years seeing the same therapist for 7+ years. \nI have all the right tools to work on this but I’m not really sure what to implement moving forward to actually see change in this space. \n\nThis is something I’d definitely benefit from bringing up to my therapist that I’d like to work on but I want to actually make impactful change on this. \nI have so much fear + anxiety about losing him thinking one day it won’t just be something he can deal with anymore because I won’t change. \n\nI pride myself on my self-awareness and he agrees that starting with being aware of it is a good place. I feel like this is just the beginning of the process of changing these habits, inclusive of uncomfortable growing pains, which comes with confronting our unfavorable behaviors or qualities. \n\n",

I hear most people talk about anxiety being ruminating thoughts and anxious about certain things. Mine seems to be different. I get these bouts of extreme dizziness and out of it feelings. Recently getting haircuts, walking in stores, driving, and even being around my friends and stuff has been causing this feeling. I get dizzy, lightheaded, and unsteady, it almost feels as if the ground is uneven (if that makes sense). Then the anxiety and ruminating starts. I have been prescribed Zoloft but have only ever taken up to 37.5mg daily and have been on that for over 4 years, cause I’m afraid of it making me feel worse. I know that that does is obviously not enough and am going to actually try and stick to upping the dosage. I’m not really sure what I am looking for in an answer, but I’m so confused on if this is even anxiety. I have had heart work ups, labs, sleep studies,ect and everything is fine so it has to be, but it seems so different from everyone else’s anxiety. Any tips or honestly anything would be appreciated",

Having to try different medicine to help with it. Stomach issues, physical symptoms and feeling dizzy the days after.. \n\nI’ve been suffering for a couple years now. The first year I went to the ER 4 times just to be told nothing is wrong… the second year I went 3 times until the very last time I went a doctor finally told me she thinks I have anxiety and prescribed me hydroxyzine to take when I felt the symptoms pop up. That helped a bit. Knowing I wasn’t actually dying yet. These weird symptoms weren’t a heart attack like google was saying it might be. I’m tired of having to suddenly cancel things because I’m feeling dizzy and don’t feel comfortable driving like that. Tired of family and people not really understanding what’s going on. Tired of feeling like less of a man because of this stupid anxiety that seems to happen for no reason and knock me on my ass for the next day or four. \n\nI think it all started for me some time after my mom passed and my dad re married. Having to then shortly after finish school on my own (was homeschooled…) and then find a job and move out. After finding out this was anxiety I managed to change my diet. A carnivore diet worked for me but I think it was mostly cutting out the sugar and caffeine and then nicotine. I lost weight and felt great but then my dog who was my mother’s dog had to be put down. She lived a very long and great life for her breed but after that I went back to my old habits. Eating junk food. Energy drinks and coffee. Vaping again… and what do you know all my anxiety and symptoms have come back even bigger and harder than ever. \n\nIf you read this then thank you, it’s long but it feels better to rant to people who might understand. I’m going to be trying to beat this again. I know it’s possible, I’ve done it once. If you guys have anything that helps you please share below. Especially any natural or over the counter things that seem to help you. For me hot showers whenever I feel something starting up and alka seltzer plus cold/flu helps me (not recommending you take it though it just seems to help me. ) what helps you guys? \n\n",

I am prone to over-thinking (as much as I don't like this term), catastrophising, hanging up on the past and worrying about the future. All of your text book anxiety stuff.\n\nI have gone through a bit of a \"mental wobble\" recently, where I have started having panic attacks in work. When I'm not in work, I'm constantly worrying about it and this results in me shutting down and doing very little during my time away from the office. I would add that I work a very mentally exhausting job. I am also undertaking my Masters, while being in full-time employment.\n\nI've been transparent with my boss and loved ones about my issues, and I've had nothing but support. I even told my university tutor, who was also very compassionate. Everyone unanimously says to me something similar - \"you're so hard on yourself\", \"I've never known anyone be as hard on themselves as you are\", \"you are overly self critical and don't need to be\", \"you need to learn to be more kind to yourself\"\n\nI've been granted a week off this week for my birthday (my boss urged me take the full week and said I deserved the down-time to do something nice, which was great!). I think, for the first time, as I reflect on my recent state, I really am just so harsh with myself. If I caught a friend talking to me the way I talk to me, I wouldn't want to be friends with them. I am exploring therapy from next week, but I'd really appreciate any tools and tips anyone has. Or at the least, to know it's not just me.",

        "Text": "For background: I am 23 she is 20, this is both of our first relationship. We met almost a year ago and have been together for around 9 months officially. We share many common interests, she is smart, pretty and all around a lovely person. On paper she is perfect, I really enjoy her company and love her to death.\n\nHowever recently I have been feeling miserable because we barely get to meet each other. I have to say that it wasn't easy in the start either, as she would not initiate anything, leading to lots of confusion on my part about if she liked me or not. I was the one to start *almost* every chat, plan all our dates. Eventually I asked her directly and she told me about her anxieties and was able to assure me that she liked me. We made things official and for a long time I felt like we were moving in the right direction. For months it was meeting up one to three times in a week and we had a blast each time. I felt loved even though I was still the one initiating contact most of the time. \n\nFast forward to today and she is feeling really stressed out by school, exams and driving school. I haven't had one on one time in person with her in over a month and can't remember the last time she sent me a message first. Last time I saw her was a couple weeks ago at a halloween party she threw together with her best friend. We manage to play videogames on discord once a week if lucky and have had a couple long whatsapp chats last week. \n\nCall me a whiny bitch but it feels really bad to be the only one to try to initate contact only to get shot down 90% of the time. For the last two months it's been an endless cycle of me trying to initiate contact with her and her being too anxious. Then me assuring that it is okay, we will get to meet when you are feeling better. But the next week she is feeling as or even more stressed out and we still can't meet. This make me initiate less and less in fear of causing more sress and anxiety to her and also because the endless rejections are just starting to feel really bad.  I try to be supportive but it's difficult when se really does not tell me about how she if feeling and the only way I know what is happening in her life is by trying to ask her.\n\nI feel like over time she has gotten used to me initiating and has completely stopped trying. Or that's the way it feels to me but it might also be that she still feels anxious about reaching out to me. Sometimes for example she might bring up a funny meme in person that she wanted to send to me but just could not send. I try to make this easy for her by but to no avail. This has been the case for a while now, even before the really bad stress of last few months, But I realized it only just now.\n\nI also fully realize that she is feeling even more miserable than I am. But the thing is, I don't have experience in anxieties like hers, so I don't really know how to help. I just try to be understanding and leave her space. Text her every couple of days to gauge how she is feeling and suggest activities with a low barrier of entry.  But I'm sure I have made mistakes too and maybe at some points I might have come across as pushy, so I have tried to change my mentality to just waiting it out and hope it gets better for her. For the last month I have really wanted to talk to her about this but there just has been no opportunity because of her withdrawing completely. I also fear bringing this up because I'm afraid she is just going to feel more stressed out knowing how I feel.\n\nLast week I saw glimmers of hope. This period of school has fewer courses and she is getting more comfortable at the driving school. I think it might be slowly getting better for her as we have had some quality chats on whatsapp again. At it's worst it was just impossible to even have a texting conversation with her because her responses were just really short and had nothing to continue the conversation to with. We even managed to make plans for this week but I had to cancel because I got sick and we rescheduled for next weekend. Luckily she also has a best friend who is really a great person and supporting, so she doesn't have to cope with her anxieties alone, even if she does not feel comfortable talking about them with me.\n\nOthers with similiar anxieties, how would you want to be approached about stuff like this? Anyone who have been in similair situation?  Sorry this is probably terribly written.",

Physical symptoms only reinforce this perception, and even when I feel good, there’s often a lingering discomfort, as if I’m somehow ignoring a danger.\n\nConnecting with people or making plans feels challenging; I find myself just wanting to stay safe and calm.   \nYet, I believe that part of overcoming anxiety is actively seeking pleasure and allowing myself to enjoy it  \n  \nfinding moments of mental or physical enjoyment rather than trying to avoid every possible threat.   \nIt’s hard at first, but I think once this becomes a habit, it starts to feel more natural, though I know it’s easy to slip back into the anxious cycle, especially when symptoms flare up.\n\nRecently, I reduced my sertraline from 100 to 50, and I’ve seen how quickly I can fall back into the cycle and how challenging it is to break out of it on sheer willpower. I’ve read and heard that we can choose how we feel, but honestly, I don’t believe we can fully choose our feelings. However, I do think we can feed or starve those feelings by how we respond.\n\nFrom what I’ve experienced, some of the biggest triggers for anxiety are:\n\n*  fear (feeling that our life is in danger)\n*  guilt (feeling that we are worthless)\n*  shame (feeling that we can be expelled from the group)\n*  repression (repression goes unnoticed but is very present)\n\nWe often see these as overwhelming forces, but really, they’re just small “devils” that threaten us, whether social or physical. We need to start seeing them for what they are—no bigger than a character like Jiminy Cricket. If we give them too much power, they’ll paralyze us. \n\nI think the counterforces to these “little devils” are curiosity, pleasure, freedom, and joy.  \nIt seems to me that when we chase that, the little devils calm down.\n\nBut fighting the little demons only brings resistance from them, we have to let them advise us, if we give them too much importance they can convince us that what they are telling us is fatal.",

I’ve talked to a therapist and a mental health nurse who BOTH said they’ve never heard of someone having my symptoms (which I experience 24/7) that was just solely anxiety but apparently no one wants to believe that, my family say ‘they don’t know you like we do, trust us it’s anxiety’ \n\nFuck no I don’t trust you. In 2020, they said some symptoms I was having was anxiety and guess what, it was Crohn’s disease and I nearly bloody died from it was so bad. \n\nFor context my symptoms are lightheadedness, I feel like I’m going to pass out 24/7 and I feel like I’m in a dream. My vision doesn’t seem right. Things move slower than they are if that makes sense, nothing looks right. My neck is severely tight, my jaw kills and my upper back kills. I have this weird feeling in my chest that I can’t explain, it’s just a cold strange feeling that is really uncomfortable. I feel like I’m dying and I experience this 24/7. Sometimes I can bear it but recently I just can’t. I’ve done everything for anxiety, anti depressants, im doing talking therapies, I did start going out a bit more but I’ve not felt good at all recently so I’ve been home bound. \n\nWhat am I meant to do? Even my GP doesn’t know what to do with me he says in a medical mystery… that doesn’t help, I want these symptoms to leave me alone because it’s been several months of hell. I have no job, no friends, no partner all because I can’t function like a normal human. Yet it’s all anxiety… yeah sure. ",

Around the same time I had a severe allergic reaction which then sent me into panic- had massive panic attack and somewhat of an out of body experience. I had to take a break from school and work and been at home all day since.\n\nSince then I’ve been feeling so off everyday. Everyday I wake up from my sleep and get existential anxiety and dread asking myself questions like what’s the purpose of life etc and just feel so empty and feel no purpose for anything. I Was never like this before. I wake up being overwhelmed from everything that’s happened and get so anxious and have been constantly feeling detached like the world isn’t real and I’m living in a simulation rn where everyday is the same day. I feel so much dread and can’t stay in the present or enjoy anything. Is this normal? \n\nI started Prozac 23 days ago- 5mg for 13 days and 10mg for 10 days now but I feel no different other than some side effects which aren’t too bad, but my anxiety is the same and I feel so off it’s debilitating. I’ve been forcing myself to go on walks everyday outside, establish a routine, and get a job nearby to distract myself and it has somewhat helped take my mind off things but the existential anxiety and dread + detachment still happen frequently and it’s excruciating. \n\nAnd what sucks is I haven’t seen any benefits yet from the Prozac either. \n\nHave any of you guys gone through this? Any advice or tips on what I should do? Any advice on how to overcome this? Does it get better? 😭",

I was drinking a lot at the time and kept convincing myself I had all of these major issues.

Its a general hum in my mind how I have to do this or that and then I will be a version of myself that is happy or fulfilled. I've recently noticed however that I've had my life together for quite a while now, no drinking or getting drunk or drugs, I have a small business that earns me a good income, a wife, and a good house and truck, I eat clean 80% of the time and hit my work outs. Despite this I am still left with this underlying tone of deep thinking and what I need to do to finally feel good or normal or to just exist in the present moment. I've learned that no matter my surrounding I am stuck with this. It is not always a panic attack or major fear. Its hard for me to just live in the present moment and feel content. Lately my vice is my mobile or computer to not be attentive in reality or to avoid work and obligations until I ultimately push through. \n\nIts really a strange feeling to explain but does this resonate with anyone? I find myself here on Sunday morning, all is going well but I don't feel content, calm or at peace. My body feels a bit full of jittery energy and I cant help but to feel like I need to do something and that's the theme of my life. ",

I graduated college this past May and have been struggling to find a job ever since. I’ve been struggling greatly even though I’ve been committed to working on my hobbies, hanging with friends/family, and working out/getting fresh air. But about three weeks ago, I began to experience some pressure on the back of my head,neck and shoulder area. I also began to feel like I’m not in tune with myself like I don’t feel all my sensations like I usually do nor do I feel like myself. It felt so weird to the point where I thought I was exhibiting symptoms of a brain tumor or a stroke. I’ve been to the hospital and urgent care and they’ve both stated that I’m probably experiencing a migraine. I guess I just thought this would be over by now since it’s been almost a month now and I still don’t feel like myself. Even after consuming alcohol I still feel detached from my body. I have an appointment with a neurologist coming up soon to see if there’s any serious issues but does anybody know what to do in this situation? ",

Anytime I get anxious it feels like I’m going to panic even if I’m at home. Like for some reason I can’t handle any anxiety even if it’s extremely minor. I pretty much have a fear of my own anxiety now. Feeling anxiety scares me more than whatever made me feel anxious in the first place if that makes any sense. \n\nAnyways, I’ve been having stomach issues for this entire year and literally can’t get to the doctor because of my anxiety issues. I’m miserable. Everyday my stomach feels terrible, it’s affecting my breathing I don’t know what’s wrong but clearly something is. This also isn’t a case of anxiety causing stomach issues, something is actually wrong.  The stomach issues do worsen my anxiety though because I’m struggling to breathe correctly through my stomach so when I get anxious it feels like I can’t breathe. I hate anxiety. I hate being like this. I’ve literally been miserable this entire year and if I didn’t have anxiety I could have gone to the doctor months ago and been feeling better already. But I just don’t see myself actually going to the doctor, the anxiety it too severe. ",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, I am facing a lot of anxiety right now and I would like to talk about it. English is not my native language so I will try to do my best. \n\n  \nMy anxiety began when I was 20. I was smoking a lot of weed (maybe 3 or 4 joints per day) at that time, to relax  myself because I was shy. One day, I felt and could see my heart beating through my chest, and all the anxiety began at that moment. During almost 6 years straight, i was stressed all day, fearing of having a heart attack. Then it escalated to panick attacks, to the point where I couldnt go outside. It was horrible.\n\nThen I found a book called Dare, and I began slowly to recover from pannic attacks, but it was very long.\n\n  \nRecently, my anxiety about my heart stopped a bit, and now, i am really fearing about developping schizophrenia. My older brother have this issue. Idk why I was looking for the symptoms on the internet, and then I began to fear every symptoms that i read.\n\nFurthermore, I m very anxious in social situation too. I really fear of people making fun of me, I always think that I am weird, that I am not enough. So I really struggle maitening great relationships with the people I met in work.\n\n  \nI went to a psychiatrist a month earlier, It was prior looking for the symptoms of shizophrenia, He listened to me during 15 minutes i guess, and told me to take a medication called amisulpride. I asked him to tell me what my problem was, he struggle to say an answer and told me \"a sort of pessimist personnality\"\n\n  \nWhen i got home from the appontement, I began to cry. The medication he gave me was an antipsychotic to cure schizophrenia. It was horrible. I talked to my mom about it, and she told me It was nothing psychiatric, and that she was like me at my age.\n\n  \nBut now, I begin to really feel i am becomung schizophrenic. I am really in my head most of the time, when i see something moving i check to see it was not a delusion, each time i see a form in the street (like a tree) I am cheking if it is someone etc. I began to see eye floater in the corner of my eyes too, and it scares me a lot. \n\nThis morning, I hear my mom twice, the exact same sound, she was in the basement and me in the kitchen. There was music in my phone, so i replayed the music to see if it was coming from my phone, and it didnt. And now i fear of asking my mom if it was her. \n\n  \nSo yeah it is very tough what i me leaving rn, I really struggle 6 years of my life with health anxiety, alone, reading books etc. If now i develop schizophrenia, it will be a disaster. \n\n  \nWhat would you do ? I want to seek another psychiatrist but i have to wait until january. Idk what to do. Now im in my mom house, but I will work the next week and i really fear being alone in my house etc. ",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "We had few infestations with fleas since 2021.  First time, in 2021 we had no idea we had fleas. We (my husband and I) had the worst and the most itchy bites we ever experienced all over our bodies. But I was much worse and ended up in emergency because of allergic reaction. We didn't know what was causing it. Doctor even told us we had scabies. It happened 3 times every two months. So, for the third time, we found fleas all over our house. We had bunnies in closed part of our yard and stray cat was visiting them every day. So infestation started in that area. We didn't know anything about them, exept from few mentioning from the movies. Then we did our research, husband bought some insecticide which can be used inside too. We did our best to solve it. After that only few appeared. We didn't see or had bites for almost a year. Last year, in August, my husband went to that part where bunnies used to stay(we didn't have them for long time anymore) and it was  huge infestation. A stray cat delivered her 5 kittens there. And before she arrived, another one did that too. We (stupids!) didn't see a potential treath! He emediately went to buy the same treatment from before, but they didn't have it anymore. He bought something else. During that time my baby was eight months (and we had her via IVF after a hard battle with infertility and misscariage). My husband told me not to go out with the baby because there was a lot of fleas. We thought we didn't have them in our house. I had some bites, but I thought they were from mosqitos beacuse they weren't so bad. But the next day I started to find few in the house. That's when I started panicking.  Previous experience was horrible, but  I didn't have a baby to worry about. That is when my anxiety started to grow. My husband treated the yard almost every or every 2 days. The cat and kittens moved. And there was still a lot of them. There weren't many in the house. But I knew I had to treat it. And wash and clean everything. I didn't have a dryer so I didn' know where to dry the loundry because fleas were everywhere. I asked my sister to use her dryer. So after few days, I found few fleas in my sisters' house. We brought them, of course, but it didn't spread. We both bought steam cleaners. Infestation lasted for 6 weeks. I was afraid to go to our yard. I only went when we were going somehere with panick checking and shaking my clothes. Most of the time when we went back to to house, even after shaking our clothes outside and washing our legs and sandals, we would carry a least one flea into the house. So, whenever he was doing something in the yard, my husband would leave his clothes outside, beside his underwear and then go inside. My anxiety was crippling. I couldn't eat, I had constant diarrhea, nausea. Plus I was ehxausted from not sleeping and washing and cleaning the house after treatments. I had pannick attacks for example, before vacuuming because I was afraid to find one. Even when my husband said that he didn't spot any flea for some time outside, I couldn't dare to go out. It took weeks to try and I could barely stand on my legs when I did. I started therapy and I also went to the psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressant, some kind of sedative and something to calm my stomach. It worked for my stomach, but I was still drowning. I was always crying and felt like a bad mother for feeling like that. It took almost 8 years to have my baby and I now I I didn't have the strenght to fight flea infestation 😔 I had many rough situations in my family, cancers and deaths and I also had health issues. But I managed to deal with that. My psycologist said I had anxiety with stronger elements of depression. My doctor said it is just anxiety because after everthing I went through. They didn't diagnosed it \"postpartum\". So, after 4 weeks I felt better from antidepressants. I would go outside and be there for about 10 minutes. I was getting better. During June, the same cat returned and delivered babies in our shed. We didn't notice, because no one was entering there. And once again she brought fleas. But it didn't spread around the house. My sister got me flea bomb. It appeared to work. We didn't notice anything the rest of the summer. We didn't see that cat or any other for a long time. But recenty I saw another one near the house and 2 weeks ago it came on our terrace. A freaked out. I chased it away and then threw some hot water on the terrace where she was standing but I didn't threw it on the balcony which is next to it. When I checked the tiles, I noticed something like flea (the same colour and bit stripy) but it had anntenae. It walked for a bit and then it jumped. Then I found another one just jumping near the place the cat was standing. I started to panick. I took my daughter inside, took our clothes off  in front our door. I only had 2 small bites on my foot few days before, but I tought it was from mosqito because I went outside without socks (and there are many mosqitos). But last year the small fleas also gave me small bites ( I know because I notices 3 types and sizes and bigger ones were causing bigger bites). My husband treated the yard few times. He says he didn't notice any. I didn't notice anything in the house. But I vacuumed and steam cleaned thoroughly. I still steam clean. I am again afraid to go outside, which is making me feel horrible because my daughter wants to play outside. I still take her regulary somewhere else by car and we spend hours there so she can be outside. But when we come back, we take off our clothes in our hall and I steam clean it with our bags. My brother in law who lives on the second floor of our house says he saw the same cat 2 times and she was with a kitten. After that he saw 2 kittens. Probably hers. Thoose are stray cats. It is impossible to catch them and we don't have services who do that. Some people in the neighborhood are feeding stray cats and they wander around their houses. I am going crazy! How to keep them away from our propery?? We tried reppelent sprays-it did't work. We sprey them with water when we see them (and I don't want lectures from animal lovers). I didn\"t mind their pees and poos, but after they are keep bringing me fleas, thay are ruining my life! We spent a lot of money because of this. I even had to buy a dryer and we have warm weather to dry them outside. What to do? To keep stripping and steaming our clothes at ur door? I am afraid of any visitors because they can bring it inside. I am afraid to go visit my family because I infected my sisters house last year. Sorry for this novel, and, yes, i know there arw much worse problems in life (and I used to handle those better) but this is making my anxiety crippling. If someone had some usefull advice how ro handle this, I would be thankfull.",

I constantly ruminate over what ifs and all of my missed opportunities. If I'm busy or distracted, I can feel pretty normal. When I've got time to myself, especially at night, then I cannot stop myself from imagining things going differently-- All the opportunities I had to just ask her out, what my life could be like if we were together. It's such a painful regret and anxiety. I know I'm a bad person for thinking this, but I secretly still hope something happens to break them up and I daydream different such scenarios (though to be clear, I would never express how I feel to her or do anything to jeopardize her engagement). Rationally I realize that none of this productive, but I feel have no control.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that it's disrupting my sleep pretty bad. I can usually fall asleep okay, but I wake up after 4-5 hours, and then I start thinking about the situation and my anxiety about finding someone and pretty quickly my heart is racing and I've got a knot in my stomach and can't fall back asleep.\n\nDistractions (like watching Netflix) can help the anxiety, but then I'm still not falling back asleep.\nI take propranalol for my anxiety, and it helped to an extent with the social/performance anxiety I was experiencing, but has not seemed to help at all with this. I'd prefer not to take more drugs, especially ones that I feel I might get dependent on like Xanax.\nI have tried mindfulness practices with no luck, though I will try to commit more.\nI know I need to start exercising.\n\nIs there anything else I can do?",

I developed my health anxiety due to multiple doctors not being able to find out what was going on with me for 7 months. \n\nI look back at my memories in my camera roll and I can’t help but miss who I used to be. I miss my old mind. \n\nI’ve had so many tests done, such as bloodwork,  a stool sample (I pray to God I never have to do that again), etc. So, if there was anything truly wrong with me, something would’ve showed up on any of those tests. \n\nThe moment I find the tiniest thing wrong with my body, I immediately feel things in that area. I hate it. It happens all the time. \n\nMy therapist told me that the reason I do this to myself is because I spent 7 months of my life focusing on something that was wrong (when people were telling me it was all in my head), that now, my mind is trying to find something new to focus on. She told me I need to rewire my mind, but i truly don’t know how to. \n\nI’ve always been against medication for anxiety, however I think it’s time to talk to my doctor. I went into my doctor’s office a couple of months ago and I was telling her how much I stress myself out and that it was really affecting me, but that I was in therapy for it. She told me if it didn’t get better, then we could possibly start talking about medication, but i said no. \n\nI truly never thought that I’d get to this point. It affects my daily life. My mind is never calm or peaceful anymore. I love being around my friends because they take my mind off of it, but I can’t be around them 24/7. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. \n\nIf anyone else has advice, feels this way too, or has any information on anxiety medication, it would be very helpful. Thank you \n\n",

He has never been anything but kind sweet loving and supportive and he has been there with me through all the friend put me through he supported me reassured me constantly. I just feel so so out of place idk who i am i have no sense of self or identity anymore and i feel completely uncapable of love.....idk if i love him anymore which hurts a lot and yes i have talked about it all with him and he is very loving and supporting he is not angry he says it's oksy to feel that way and that we will get through this together and that he loves me even if i am unsure of my feelings he doesn't pressure me at all he is such a pure sweet soul and it breaks my heart that i can't love him right......it just hurts so much....am i falling out of love with him? or are my thoughts just all over the place? is this the aftermath of everything this friend put me through? when will i heal what do i do? i constantly feel like a horrible person i don't really feel angry often so i never snap or anything but i feel like i am hurting him by not being able to love him the way i used to......he assures me that he is here and he is not going anywhere and he loves me no matter how dark it might seem. i sometimes wish i never met the friend who manipulated me she really said hurtful things very harsh and hurtful things about my relationship with him too. Like \"well i feel like you don't love him enough and someday he will find someone who will love him right and really show him thst love\" or \"well maybe he is not the right one if he doesn't help you heal\" and that left scars in me i told my bf about it and he got very angry at her not at me. i know that it's in the past but it still hurts.....\n\n\n\nI sometimes feel so numb like i don't feel anything anymore at all....do i need to break up with him? bc i am unsure of my love for him? but i have never had doubts before only after the friend ghosted me....i feel like he deserves so much better bc i am a horrible person.....idk what to do...\n\n\n\ni am sorry it's so long i just had to get it out somewhere my thoughts are all over the place so sorry if anything i say doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\nand yes i am aware therapy is an option to consider but i have had an uncomfortable encounter with a therapist and i struggle a lot with anxiety so i am scared.

        "Text": "Hi all\n\nI was on sertraline for 7 years for mild depression. It helped. I came off them last year as I didn't think I needed them anymore.\n\nFast forward to March of this year, I was going through some really stressful times with anxiety and was prescribed sertraline again. I took a 50mg tablet before bed, woke at 4am having a full blown panic attack (hadn't had a panic attack for years prior to this). This completely put me off taking another tablet as I was terrified of this happening again.\n\nFast forward again to a couple of months ago... I've been taking a weight loss injection, Mounjaro, which little did I know, has a side effect of anxiety.... my anxiety for the last 2 / 3 months has been frightening. I've been having daily panic attacks and nothing I'm doing is helping this awful feeling of anxiety, fear, panic etc. I've come off the injections but I don't see myself getting better without medication.\n\nI've developed health anxiety, medication anxiety, intrusive and very unwanted thoughts, anxiety over just about everything. I've never felt this way before.\n\nI think I have to go back on sertraline or another type of SSRI but I'm so afraid of the side effects. I'm just afraid of everything right now. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with the same sort of thing? Are any of you on sertraline for severe anxiety and panic attacks???? How did you manage side effects etc? Are there better medication than sertraline with less side effects?\n\nI feel completely lost right now, so looking for some reassurance. Thanks x\n",

I finally felt like myself! I was dealing with bad EDs and I suddenly had a craving for ice cream (lol) so I ordered it and it was the most delicious thing I had to eat EVER. And the guilt didn’t even kick in, I simply didn’t care at all. After that experience, I started to self medicate and decided my own doses, read about it a bunch ect. I was a dumb 14 yo just so we’re clear, never do this yourself please.\nI started taking them once a week in larger doses, between 2-5 0.5 pills.

Now’s where the problem kicks in :\n\nI stopped feeling it. Almost completely.\nIt used to feel euphoric, like everything is going to be okay, like I don’t care about anything (in a good way), stopped my over - thinking, made me hungry and made every food taste absolutely incredible, and so much other things.\n\nI’ve had periods where I stopped for a month, tops. Maybe helped once but not anymore that’s for sure.\nI don’t know what to do, I assume my body got used to it and has to get a significant enough cold turkey stop, but I can’t seem to bring myself to do so. My life is so stressful, and I’m looking forward for my “klonopin” days all the time…\nReally important to me to highlight - dependent? Yes, addicted? No. I actively choose to have my “klonopin days” on days where I’m most busy and working, I don’t “get off” on the high most of the time, just happy I can function as A normal human being, nullifying my anxiety.\nWhat should I do? I lost all direction, I would love it if you have some suggestions. Thanks in advance.",

The clinic tells me that the soonest available appointment is in January 2025. I’ve been taking it for years now, and it took my body a long time to not only become adjusted to it but to see improvements. \nI wish my clinic would have told me about this sooner because now I feel like the progress I made will be erased. The withdrawal symptoms will be horrible, and who knows when I will be able to get a refill for my medication.

Untrained, offleash dogs are a genuine issue so my dog becoming part of the flood of stories about how someone got slobbered on or accosted by a dog is a real nightmare for me. \n\nA few months ago, my dog howled in the shower after I had to wash him to check for injuries after a dog bit him (I didn’t know the other dog was resource guarding when I/my dog tried to retrieve the ball it dropped, which was mine and the owner was MIA). My downstairs neighbor heard it through the pipes and apparently thought my dog was seriously injured and texted my landlord, who immediately texted me that concern. I think the neighbor was probably really upset and bothered by the noise so I left notes on the doors of everyone in the complex (8 units) apologizing for the noise and provided my phone number to fix any issues. But, I couldn’t sleep for about two days. \n\nAdmittedly, I’ve spent a lot of time on r/dogfree because I want to make sure I’m not doing things that bother other people unknowingly and I’d like to be less of a social nuisance while having a dog. This doomscrolling definitely does contribute to my anxiety, but I feel like people should be informed about why other people feel their choices are socially harmful (in my case, having a dog). \n\nIt feels like every time my dog acts out of line I’m about to have a panic attack.  He’s an anxious dog, and it seems to make his behavior worse and him more stressed out too.

We were on canal tour ride on boat. There were speakers talking about what we were seeing but I couldn't hear anything because three girls were talking and laughing so loud. They were in their late 20s or maybe early 30s and I thought nothing bad can happen and that they would understand if i told them to be a little quieter.

Even 10 hours later I'm stll thinking about our little talk and how embarrased I felt.\nEven when the ride was over, I heard them yelling to my bf that I need spark in my life and they can give him tips, that I'm loser, that I'm living sad life etc.. i was pretending that i couldnt hear them and that I was looking on my phone but was very shaken about it all.\n\nMy bf didn't stand up for myself but he said that he didn't see point with talking to them because I didn't do anything wrong and they were so rude and talk with them would be just a waste of time and even tho I agree with him and of course I didn't want to make scene, I'm little sad. \n\nAnyway I know I won't see them ever again, but I am still little shaken up.

He would say \"I'll let you know\" and then not let me know, wouldn't text me back, and when he would go out with his friends he would just disappear and text me the next day (if he did). We spent a lot of time together, and he slept over at my place very constantly, but when we were not together, his communication was pretty much nonexistent.\n\nThe hardest part would be when we had a fight. He's a secure person but has some avoidant tendencies that come up during conflict sometimes. He would completely shut down, not talk, it was very scary for me because I would just think he was going to leave me and that I messed everything up.\n\nThis caused me to start having anxiety and panic attacks, and create all these stories in my head and go into a spiral I couldn't pull myself out of. No matter how much reassurance he would give me and even if things were good, I would always think something was wrong, \"he's not talking to me because he doens't want to be with me anymore\", \"he thinks I'm annoying\", \"he doesn't care about me\", \"I'm way too needy, I need to stop\" Then I would be proven wrong, turns out I had nothing to worry about, and  this loop would all happen over and over AND OVER again. I was doing therapy for all of this, but eventually went to the doctor and after having an episode in his office, I was prescribed with Lorazepam, which I am only supposed to take when I'm having a panic attack. I was having them 2-3 times per week.\n\nI don't want to make this too long, we have come a long way, he now texts me goodnight and replies to my texts (like a regular person), calls me in the morning when we're not sleeping together the night before, sticks to his word and plans with me, and no more of those \"shutting down\" episodes. I have been doing so well the past couple of months, I haven't taken an anxiety pill in weeks.\n\nAnd then something happened again 2 nights ago, where he shut down and I got incredibly triggered, and I haven't been able to let it go. Things did go differently this time, as he came back to me very quickly, apologized and recognized what was happening and we talked.\n\nI had a panic attack last night and I needed to call him to just hear his voice and tone to make sure he's not mad at me and that we were okay, which I realized he wasn't the second he picked up the phone. I'm going into spirals again. I feel like this event, even if it wasn't as bad as before, has set me back again and I feel like I lost all my progress. I feel so alone and helpless and lots of shame for being like this, why can't I just accept that everything is fine and behave like a regulated person? Why can't I accept it was just a bump in the road and it's nothing compared to all the good? There's SO MUCH good, it breaks me that it's not enough. Then what is enough?\n\nThank you for reading.",

I was looking at my phone and a random lady thought I was taking a photo (I wasn’t). Immediately she starts yelling at me. I mean, YELLING. Demanding I delete the “photo” of her, going off about how there were naked people in the locker room. We were in a corner area, far from the showers (big gym) and there weren’t even any other people around, much less any naked people. I tried to tell her that I didn’t even take a photo but she would not stop screaming to even let me speak. It was horrible. \n\nI eventually just got my things and left. As I’m walking out she’s still shouting about it. It really shook me up. I know I didn’t do anything wrong but I can’t shake the stress and anxiety of the situation. What if she complains about me and I get into trouble? What if other people heard her and think a certain way about me? What if I run into her again in the gym? \n\nI completely understand people not wanting anyone taking photos in the locker room. I get that. Our gym is big and popular and I do see other people doing it occasionally, but I’ve never seen anyone say anything about it. And how hard would it have been to say, “hey, I think I just saw you take a photo. Please don’t do that, it makes me uncomfortable.” I feel like I could’ve explained myself easily and there would have been no issue. How on early do people think it’s okay to just immediately start yelling? At strangers?? In public??? I’m also 15 weeks pregnant so extra sensitive right now, which isn’t helping. I’ve tried to just brush it off but it’s ruined my day. \n\nIt was humiliating and I’m having so much anxiety about it. Please help me shake this. ",

I was surprised by just how \"off\" you can make yourself feel just by overthinking and getting in an anxiety loop of sorts. At times, when it first started and I was having panic attacks frequently, I was worried I was going \"insane\" because I was having trouble thinking straight and felt like I was not fully in control of my thoughts or emotions. Since then I have calmed down pretty significantly, but I have had trouble shaking the overall sentiments. There are still days where I get worried every time a muscle twitches or I have to read something twice, as though it indicates something seriously wrong. It's like there is a part of me that knows I'm being very silly and a part of me that is genuinely worried I'm about to perish via what amounts to spontaneous brain combustion. That is kind of worrisome to me, this weird irrational dichotomy. I realized recently though, that such a thing is not particularly uncommon. A lot of people have at least one thing they are irrational about that they contend with themselves over. Everyone is wired differently and I don't know that anyone is wired perfectly.",

I asked about my plan, only to get left delivered for 4 days. \n\n\nThey \"read\" my message eventually, but that was only to ask about another club, and after I had replied, I was yet again left on read for another 3 days. They never replied to my original message.\n\n\nI decided to try to be the bigger person and stop dooming over getting repeatedly left on read in regards to crucial issues regarding our club operations. So after the 5th day, I decided to reach out again and ask them about the original question again. It's been a week since. I have been still getting left on delivered. \n\n\nQuite frankly, it's not like I can cut them off like a friend, they are essential. Without them, I'll get bombarded and overloaded with having to plan everything (which ironically is the case now LOL) I can't tell if it's perhaps my fault, maybe my message was too long? Perhaps they finally heard about that rumor going around at school about me? After all, it'd make sense given how they used to greet me with a wave whenever we ran into each other during passing period, but now I just get the cold shoulder.

I can compare it to being strapped in an airliner that is on its way to crash, not able to move, and not able to get out of the situation. Nearing certain death. That is how it felt last night.

The worst thing is that recently, i got back from a trip and i needed to take the train and the only available seat was marked with a number 13. When i got off the train and started walking back home, thinking that im dumb to believe in such things as bad luck, i nearly got mugged by a man with a knife for the first time in my life and the fear has only deepened by then (nearly because i saw a part of a silver switch knife in his hand which he held extremely tight and i ran away before he could even extend it and threaten or hurt me). \n\nAlso i have a deep fear of fortune telling or those comment chains like \"if you dont do something, something bad will happen\" which i skip as fast as i can. The most recent situation was today at work when i bought myself some juice, where in my country a specific brand of juice has little writings underneath the cap with inspirational texts like \"be happy\" or \"do the thing you always wanted to\". But today i got \"something unexpected might happen today!\", it was written in a positive way but i still was stressed for the whole day and couldnt stop being alert of every possible danger around me. \n\nI know its extremely stupid and irrational but i cant get over it.

I feel so much anxiety like I'm always forgetting something or imagining what he might have thrown away or moved and I'll never know. \nHELP",
