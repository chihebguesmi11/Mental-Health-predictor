        "Text": "So, my brother's SO just had a blow-up with her child outside my open door. He didn't want to go to school. She said, \"I will be God damned if my son just makes excuses, and is too lazy to go to work when he's an adult.\" After, she just had a discussion with me in the kitchen about how she wants to get a job, but my brother won't let her. It's no secret she would have me working M-F 8 hours a day, and have the paycheck go straight into her account, without another thought about it. But, I don't work for her. I am living my own life, and going through my own journey, that she knows nothing about. Because it's on the inside. To her, I am a lazy, excuse-maker. To me, I have PTSD and have to deal with depression and anxiety daily. I help out around the house with their children, but they do not place any value on what I bring to the table. When I am able to go out and work, I get juice because we have nothing to eat or drink it my house (thanks to inflation). I feel like when I don't have the apple juice or orange juice, my body is noticeably weaker. \n\nAnyways, I guess I just wanted to get on here - and let everyone know - even if you have a family member that sees your PTSD as laziness, it is not. You are strong. You are doing what you're supposed to be doing by working on yourself, and not giving up every single day. Others are not going to understand that about you, and that's okay. Now, I just need to read that over and over again, until I believe it myself. ><",

Lord knows I can’t go through this alone, but nobody knows what I’m going through and that’s what makes me so different from the rest. \nI feel like I’m forced to keep going without any form of support. I shouldn’t have to be anything in order to get the love that I deserve. So why am I still alone?  \n \nEveryone terrifies me. All of the kids are being so mean and loud. And I crumble under them. Why can’t I even cope with being raped? Because I’m still not free. And you can’t cope with something that you’re still going through, can you? And I don’t mean that I’m still being raped. \nI’m talking about the aftermath. \nI haven’t had any time or chance to sit back and try to think about what happened, because I suddenly get triggered from some foolish little thing that I haven’t even realized affects me way more than I think, and then I get scared again. \nAnd I guess the reason I get so emotional internally  whenever a kid twice as young as me bullies me, is because I have been bullied before. I get a fear of being made fun of again, because I remember it feeling horrible back then. My body shivering as I’m being humiliated infront of people, not knowing what I should say or do so I just smile or say “ok.” \nAs I looked back at my text, I realized that I can’t cope with my own things and ‘stuff’…Because I’m so alone in this orphanage and also afraid of being bullied alongside with the other stimuli, so obviously I can’t focus on anything. I try to take things slowly but I fall back on the ground and it gets harder for me to get back up because I realize that nobody is yet helping me. \n\nAnyway, I apologize for using phrases that are annoying at this point because I know that everyone on tiktok uses the words “traumatized” and shit carefreely without realizing what the words actually mean so It’s easier to probably not take me seriously but I do hope that you take me seriously. I have trouble communicating and knowing when to say and what to say so my point might come off as unclear but I hope someone relates to my emotions and maybe we could benefit from eachother in this community by sharing our stories and what we’re going through right now.

        "Text": "I was a victim of domestic violence for years with two separate partners. Tons of awful things happen, examples include being forced to chug grain alcohol to induce a miscarriage, held hostage and as I tried to escape be dragged back through the door Texas chainsaw style, and being strangled to the point of near death, one of those partners is in prison. \n\nLast night I got the courage to bring up some things to my current partner that were bothering me. We’ve been together for two years now, live together, if minor things bother me I generally keep my mouth shut - as ‘being open with frustration’ with my partners in the past didn’t end well. He has never shown any inclination that he would ever try to hurt me. Anyways, he was not receptive at all and was very short and irritated, to be fair when humans argue it’s not often a sweet soft spoken conversation, he was already lying down after a long day of work and his masters program. I really was initially keeping my cool, and saying clearly what had been upsetting me. He started to raise his voice to the point of almost yelling and this is when a switch completely flipped in my brain.\n\nHim raising his voice told me something bad was about to happen. I immediately stepped out of the room and into the bedroom and closed the door. I started to panic more and more not able to regulate myself and started barricading the door with the wardrobe, even though he wasn’t yelling anymore. Then my brain told me it wasn’t enough and I had to leave the house. I went to grab the car keys which were now missing. I started to now absolutely go into fight mode as I now felt trapped with no means of escape, we live rurally so I can’t just walk down the street. \n\nHe had hid the keys after I went to the bedroom because we had shared a few glasses of wine some hours prior. I demanded he give me the keys and he refused, I started screaming and crying that if he doesn’t give them to me right now I would call someone. I felt like I had no control over what I was doing or saying. He gave them to me and I drove halfway down the street with my dog, parked the car and was just sobbing uncontrollably. \n\nHe called me saying he left the house and that I could track his location so I knew he wasn’t there. It was now like 1am. So I came back home and locked myself in the room falling asleep with a knife in my hand. He did eventually come home and sleep on the couch. This morning we hugged.\n\nWow. I feel like an absolutely crazy person. I really wish I could have regulated myself the second he started to raise his voice by just walking away and that would have been that. Instead it escalated into a ridiculous and potentially dangerous situation where in the middle of my night my partner had to leave the house. Today is filled with shame. ",

A big part of this abuse which I remember was triggered through me dreaming. I was aware that the abuse had happened but I was in big big denial at the time and I didn’t start processing it until I moved out. I’m no longer in contact with my dad but will occasionally have dream/nightmares. This leads me onto what happened last night. I was having a very vivid dream which was involving my dad, although no abuse was happening but in the dream I kept losing the ability to breath and then I would regain it. The only way I can describe it is if someone was choking me and then releasing at the point of passing out. \n\nI woke up and was obviously shaken and confused because I’ve never had this happen before. But one thing I noticed was my fist up against my throat. Is it possible to reenact abuse? I can’t recall anything like that happening when I was a child but I also can’t remember big portions of my childhood. \n\nI’ve been researching sleep apnea and have zero other symptoms. I’m not tired during the day, I get up at 6am and go to the gym, my performance in the gym is perfectly fine and I don’t feel exhausted, I don’t get headaches other than the odd one when I’ve shared I bottle of wine on the weekend with my partner, I don’t fall asleep during the day. So the idea of it being sleep apnea doesn’t seem plausible. ",

Working from home today and already had half a bottle of wine and multiple benzo's. Pain is extreme, should't be an excuse but so lonely I didn't know what to do so chose the stupid things.\n\nParents left when I was six (lots of trauma consedering violence, mental, verbal and physical abuse and CA). Went to foster family and foster dad thought I was cute or something so decided to repeat the cycle until I was eleven. Foster mother accused me of being 'too sexual' and asking for it (DEFINITLY WHAT A CHILD DOES YES, VERY VERY VERY ACCURATED (sarcasm).\n\nSo holidays coming up, had a break up this year, we lived together. Found a new place for myself, and found a man I really adore. He's a rapper and very kind, but very busy with music and his friends who are all in that scene. He has moodswings, loves me extremely when I'm happy, snappy when I'm sad/need support. So lots of guilt now because I am not feeling good.\n\nHe's working for christmas and I don't think he wants me to be there for New Year (fucked up his Birthday because I was so coked up, as was he, and I went into trauma spiral which he hated and after he made me know that he had to 'think' about us. Mind you, I tried to stop the binge multiple times and asked him for help.. Wasn't happening. Also tried to leave the relationship, but I always came back bevause of hope and figuring out that I am a burden and need to do better.\n\nStill can't talk a lot about anything conidering my pain, even though I'm not traumadumping would be nice to explain some of my difficulties in social situations and the stress, so we could resolve it but 'it hurts him too much to hear about my past' and he gets defensive at times.\n\nSo here I am bottled up with pain, loneliness and fear of abondement and tons of shame. I want a family to visit too (fosterparents died). Imma be alone at the holidays, and I feel like a waste of space.\n\nIf anyone has any words or an emoji, I would love that. I'm sorry if this bothers anyone. I just want to not feel alone for a bit. Sorry if I ask too much, I know I have to handle what life threw at me myself but I'm tired and don't see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI'll feel better soon, but this week the days get darker and darker. I'm trying my best, but I don't think anyone should be left like this by family and be hurting as shit. They suck, I suck, you all don't suck.\n\nLove.",

A year later, she died after I ignored her calls (we had a restraining order against her), she later killed herself that night. \nI'm so tired. It's agonizing to live like this and I seriously don't know how much longer I can take it. \nI'm a senior now, and everyday I think about her, her death, my role in it. \n\nIt's so fucked up. Constantly I flip-flop between being glad she died, and being willing to do anything to have her back. Between blaming myself, and understanding. Between loving, and hating her. The cognitive dissonance has genuinely given me migraines that lasted for hours, and I lie awake at night hyperventilating, writhing in pain because of it.\n\nI don't know how to fix myself. I go to therapy twice a week. I have done multiple types of therapies including EMDR, and Accelerated Resolution Therapy. Nothing is working. \nWhat makes it worse is I refuse to resort to any addictive substances as a form of escapism because my mom was an addict and I refuse to be anywhere near what she was. So, I just exist, and suffer, and rot in my own head. \n\nI could go on. My mom starved me, and left me in motels with pedophiles as she drank to death. I found her seizing on the ground from alcohol poisoning. My first suicide attempt was when I was 9 years old. I should hate her for all of this, and I do because what the fuck? But I also would do anything to tell her I'm sorry, and I love you, and I miss you because the last time I saw her sober was the summer where I got my first period, and when I tried to flush my used pad down the sink, she grabbed it with her hands, and told me she would only do this for me, and then I just can't hate her. God, I just can't hate her. But then I remember her eyes as she looked down at me while her hands wrapped around my throat, and I feel grief, betrayal all over again. Because I could exist,  pretend when she was neglecting me, but I can't now. Not when she looked at me with eyes that conveyed such horrendous intentions I can't even speak it out loud. Why? Why would she do that to me? I was sleeping in bed, and I woke up to her strangling me. I had just turned eleven, and you were my mom. And then I couldn't even ask her why because she killed herself, because of me. \n\nI don't know what to do, what to feel, what to think and it's going to kill me. I can't live like this.",

        "Text": "Hi, \n\nI don't want y'all to diagnose me, you're literally not qualified. I just feel crazy and want to know if there's something actually worth looking into. I feel ridiculous for even considering it. I just ask to be talked out of it, or into it (if it seems worth it).\n\nSo basically I was dating someone at my college and it went really bad. She is not a physical threat to me. I told her off and so I don't realistically think she'd ever try to talk to me, touch me, or burst into my room again. Nevertheless, I lock the door and turn the fans on high (she's my neighbor), it just makes me feel safer?? I guess? From a threat that isn't even real. (I feel crazy)\n\nShe's inescapable. We have a class together, there's only one cafeteria, we still share friends. Being in the same room, my body goes into overdrive, it's like it's full of energy, heart pounding, and brain screaming to leave, but I'm frozen and silent, although I'm going to be dysregulated for an hour or evening or day, depending on the severity. It doesn't really seem to fit the description of a panic or anxiety attack. It's just weird. Sometimes I have the thought \"What if I run into her?\" and my body jumps into that frozen action mode even when she's not even there or there's no risk of her being there. It's crazy.\n\nSo yeah, obviously I changed my routes and schedule so I could maximize avoiding her. I go to meals at times she thinks are ridiculously early, I don't study in the library anymore (I miss it so bad), I walk the inconvenient way home and keep mental track of when she must be out of her room at a class or club so that I can feel free to go to the kitchen, bathroom, or laundry without the risk of her. (Again, what risk?)\n\nThe risk is really just emotional. It's the body thing, it's the intrusive memories. They're not sensory at all. They come suddenly. Sometimes they're triggered by something going on (I can't watch or read romance anymore and I used to default to it as something shitty and fun lol), but sometimes I'm just like taking the stairs or in a casual conversation at work. \n\nWithout my even really noticing, I developed depression. You know, couldn't focus for more than 30 minutes, hated eating, hated sleeping unless it was daytime nap time, etc. It's been a long time now, so I think it's more chronic than situational. That, I do have diagnosed. I take the happy pills now and they help. But still, the memories find me at night sometimes and I can't sleep, or they take away my appetite, or I feel I should be confined to my room. \n\nI can't emphasize enough how she isn't a genuine risk. But terror grasps me in a vice-like grip when I see her or hear her grating voice and then the day is just over for me. \n\nIt's been months, many months. My friends say I've processed enough. Mentioning this idea of PTSD out loud feels like too much, like I might just be looking for validation that the pain is real when everyone around me is acting like nothing's really happened and are treating me weird. Like I said, I feel crazy and confused, forever. I just turned 20 so I know it gets better and everything but this really sucks.",

I feel like it is helping to an extent with the paranoia and serious jitters but in place of it I get more sad and emotional. I know I am fairly sensitive to THC but I like having full spectrum. I want to add CBG too so I got a CBG isolate that I found. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else has tried CBD/CBG for severe anxiety or PTSD.

        "Upvotes": 0,
        "Text": "Hi, *TW* \n\nThis may be quite a read. I recently had a revelation this week although this story takes place last year. 2 years ago on the day before my birthday I was assaulted by a medical doctor without my consent. I really don’t want to get into details, but that assault left me completely wrecked. I couldn’t even celebrate my 29th birthday. Instead I tried to figure out ways to do the unthinkable. Throughout that year I tried everything to “get over” the situation, but I just simply couldn’t. I isolated myself away from family and friends for months and was engaged in pretty reckless things. I have bipolar disorder so that also didn’t help. Later in the year, I went to see another doctor to discuss what happened and to examine my body and she told me news that completely shocked me. See the doctor did things to me while I was under anesthesia and I didn’t know the extent of the damage until I went to see another provider that I trusted. That was in November. By December, the depression had gotten so bad it spiraled into mixed episodes that I couldn’t control. I had nightmares so I was unable to sleep and quite frankly, I was too terrified to sleep. Things got so bad I had to go to a mental hospital for a period of time in December. When I got out I stayed with family in another state to just get away from all the madness. My birthday is March. I have a friend who’s birthday is 3 days before mine. I told my friends about a week and half before my bday that I wanted to celebrate my day in another country from March 9-12. My bday is 11th. The assault happened on the 10th. Because many people (including my friend who’s bday is 3 days before mine don’t know about what happened to me and I intend to keep it that way). However, half the girls invited are aware of what happened. When I invited them I told them it’s for my bday but in reality it was because I couldn’t bare to stay in the state that induced so much trauma. I didn’t care who came all I said was cover your flight I’ll take care of the place. Anyway some oddly chaotic things happened on day 1 so they decided to have a beach day on day 2 and everybody wanted to stick together as safety. I was not ok with this. I wanted to go the beach and cry and mourn and be myself because that day was my 1 yr anniversary of the incident. They wouldn’t let me. Instead we had a group day and then we celebrated my friends birthday with a dinner. None of the people who knew about this day ever asked me if I was ok with this. How can I celebrate a monumental moment for someone who btw had already celebrated her day on the day of her birth? Instead I had to show face and act like it was any other day and hide in the bathroom to cry before I got dressed to support her. I have a good poker face but my heart wasn’t in it. The flashbacks that would sporadically come throughout the day, I would have to just take it. I support so much of my people when they grieve through the loss of their loved ones especially during their anniversaries. But I’m not understanding when we go through self grief and mourning the loss of not only the person we were but the event that changed the trajectory of our lives, it almost seems insignificant? In no means do I ever want to be pitied for what I went through. As shitty as it sounds, that’s the hand I was dealt with. But for someone  celebrate another persons birthday on that day? Orchestrated by people Who knew how badly I suffer d the year before? On my trip?! How badly even to this day I struggle with even opening myself up. It felt like a complete slap in my face. The only reason I bring up something like this is because a friend of mine was blindsided by others celebrating another friends birthday party on the date of my aforementioned friends actual birthday. The other girls day was a week before and she had already somewhat celebrated it. But she wanted a cabin kickback and all the friends supported that event instead of the other girls actual birthday. Looking back I wish I didn’t  go to the kickback but i was intentially taking as many benzos I couldso I could numb my pain and calling as many hotlines as I could just to make sense of the situation I was going through (this is all 1 month before I got committed). My homegirl the other day brought up the kickback situation and asked me how I would feel if I was the actual bday girl and for the first time it hit me this is the 1 day of the year has to herself and we selfishly celebrated another girls birthday who already had a birthday celebration. She could’ve easily done her event the following week and now the other girl doesn’t want to celebrate her bday any longer. In the same way my friends should’ve honored the fact that I didn’t want anyone to give another girl a dinner on the anniversary of the worst day of my life. My trip was supposed to be a rebirth for me to try to cope with what happened on one day and a 30th the next. I paid for accommodations, made the itinerary. Shit I practically did everything by myself to set it up because it’s my event. So why am I thinking about this a year and a half in? I guess I finally understand my friends feelings. I think we’re robbed of experiences, moments and days that are meant for us. Nobody’s saying we want the whole yr, but at least respect, support and appreciate the little to one days we ask for us. Any chances of friends trying to fix up just seems like it’s absolving their guilt (in my friends case). As for me I never told anyone. Because I worry even if I did say something, nothing would change and it is what it is. Don’t get me wrong I love my friends but I just finally peeped the game. Let me thoughts and advice. Best ",

The Psychiatry in my country overlooked it even though I was in and out of mental hospitals.\n\nAfter the therapist explained the idea behind the therapy (this took a lot of sessions)  I started with the first in vivo exposure.\n\nIt was a 5 on the SUD scale (the lowest one I had) , however that quickly turned out to be way too low.\n\n\n\nThe therapist wanted me to sleep a night without a bra on. I have not done this in the last 20+ years.\n\nI could not cope with the thought, so it was changed to me not having one on for 30 minutes at day time.\n\nMy husband came home and found me falling to pieces. My anxiety hit the roof, I started coughing (I will cough and cough and then freak out because I get triggered by my inability to breathe in a proper manner). \n\nIt got so bad that apparently I had looked at my husband and stated \"I don't want to die, I don't want to die!\"\n\nHe managed to get me to point at the SUD scale and I pointed to 8. He then decided enough was enough, and I stopped the exposure. \n\nThe therapist said that no, it was not suppose to be so hard, but sometimes there was no other way. \n\nWe then waited with the in vivo exposure and moved on to imaginal exposure.\n\nThings went from bad to worse fast.\n\nI was told that I needed to inhale a little and exhale a lot by the therapist if I started to feel anxious.\n\nBut I was not allowed to use this technique during the exposure. \n\nShe also said I could not: Sit outside, use anything to calm my anxiety afterwards (like benzodiazepin -because if I did not get really really scared I would not learn that it would not kill me) , could not sleep afterwards, could not listen in the evening, could not be disturbed by any pets, could not sit next to my husband.\n\nSo I ended up in another building, alone and scared out of my mind before I even pressed \"play\".\n\nI listened to the recording daily, SUDS ranging from 7-9 each time. \n\nCould not sit up because of pain in the areas that were hurt during the assault. Having to lie down freaked me out. Threw up, coughing fits, absolutely falling apart.\n\nTook me 4+ hours to be somewhat calm afterwards.\n\nThis went on for weeks.\n\nTried talking to the therapist, saying that this is how bad it gets, it takes me hours to calm down afterwards. \n\nShe made me make a list of things that made me happy. \"Like maybe a puzzle or gardening?\".\n\nI couldn't do that because my system was so freaked out.\n\nThen it got even worse.  \n\nI got a maximum of 3 hours of sleep every night, could not eat, was constantly triggered, startled, and so on.\n\nTrashed the house twice. I smashed the glass in our oven, the heavy, sliding garage door, plates, a kettle, threw a wooden bench across the room. Pushed my husband.\n\nThe police got called.  \n\nAgain I asked for help with my therapist. I am not usually like this. I do not throw furniture around and smash my home and I have never laid hands on another human being before apart from during the assault. \n\nThe SUDS were now at a minimum of 8 every time. Asked if help and guidance were available for my husband who did not know what to do.There were none.\n\nA co-worker of my therapist called me (my therapist were on vacation). \"No one gets worse from this treatment\" \"I have a lot of faith in this treatment and knows it works\" \"Maybe it would help if you could acknowledge that this is also hard for your husband\".\n\nEventually I dropped out of treatment. I could not function. I still can't. \n\nFelt weak for not being able to cope. Felt scolded by the co-worker. \n\nIf I am trying to sleep in the evening and my husband makes the slightest sound in a adjacent room (like using a lighter, talking to the dog and so on) my system reacts like someone threw fireworks into the bedroom.\n\nSocial interactions are close to none. I do not function in them, I do not function at all. I rarely even leave the house, do not answer the door if the mailman comes etc. My marriage is in shambles.\n\nI fight to get out of bed. Help take care of our animals and go back to bed. Just laying there. It has been six months since I stopped therapy.\n\nIt does not get better for me. \n\nIf you read this wall of text, thank you. I feel so alone.\n\n",

Her first question was, \" did it felt good?\" I had nothing to say so I cried. \nShe don't know that I am into girls, she's kinda homophobic so I never brought it up.\n I told her all of the things that happened and her question was, \"are you sure you didn't misunderstood your father's actions?\" I was left speechless again.\n\nWhen I was 5 years old I saw a sex tape on my father's phone, he made me watch it with him. I got weird feeling and left. I never told anyone. At 7 I felt my father pushing his D in my ass cracks. I felt disgusted, I remembered it happening 5-7 times and I cried to my mother to get me a separate bedroom. Till this time, I never said a single word.\nI was 10 when my sister(adopted) talked to me about how our father treated her, she was 15 at that time. I started getting scared of my father. We never said anything to anyone cos my sister didn't wanted to create a drama. The same thing happened with my sister again when he drugged her and raped her. After thay time, my sister and I started keeping knife on our pillows. \n\nWhen I was 12, I had to go to city to study, at that time he volunteer that he would drop me off. I was scared. I thought something bad gonna happen, and it did. I got raped by my father at a motel when I was half unconscious. I met my sister and we cried a lot. But we didn't dare to say anything to anyone, my sister told that's how all men are. I started getting scared of that man. \n\nIt happened again when I was 14 but my sister faced the same thing with  me, he took us out to a vacation. My sister and I, we kept a knife with us to kill him if he tries anything. When we went to the hotel bedroom, I got unconscious and fell on the bed. After god knows how many hours I woke up to see me without bottoms and my sister without any clothes. We cried a lot. My sister ran away from home and my brother took me to his care. I used to get scared pf my brother a lot because of the same thing.  I never told him what happened with me, but I told him what happened with my sister. He didn't react much but he never let me meet that man. \n\nMy brother became my father and took care of me, my studies and helped me a lot. I told him I was into girls and he just said it doesn't matter but I don't wanf you dating anyone before 18. ",

I'm not sure if that's how I should word it, I am kind of new to this. But basically in April this year I had a suicide attempt and then again in May. Since then I went to an IOP program and that's where I got PTSD and depression diagnoses. I was mostly fine tbqh, except I have so little memory of last year when some bad things happened to me and I was super suicidal. But after recovering from my suicidality, I started having these horrible nightmares. They'd wake me up through the night and I started dreading going to bed. It would be almost like a lucid dream of reliving my memory. Then, about a week ago I was super triggered by someone nonconsensually kissing me, and since then I'vebeen having these night sweats where I have to wash my bedsheets every day and I wake up wet. \n\nI have been assuming it's related to being triggered, but was wondering if anyone had any advice to resolve night sweats, information on potential side effects from medication, advice on getting medication, or just general love and support.\n\n  \nThanks <3",

I also want to mention that this post might be a bit long.\n\nBackground and Context\n\nLike most posts of this nature, I think it’s essential to provide some background and explain a bit about the situation.\n\nAbout a year ago, I started dating my current boyfriend, whom I care for deeply. Throughout our relationship, I began to notice that he struggles significantly to open up, even just a little, emotionally. Additionally, he often takes days to reply and sometimes leaves me on read. Initially, when this happened, I reacted as anyone might—I assumed he simply wasn't interested in me, and I considered breaking things off. However, things took a turn when he started sharing more about himself.\n\nHis Background and Challenges\n\nHe told me about his experiences in the military service, which he continues to face as an active member. It’s a bit complex to explain since his service isn't like the typical military service one might envision in the United States. I won't go into too many details here, but after he shared this with me, I found myself at a loss on how to support or understand him better. Despite making my first efforts to comprehend his situation, the same issues persisted.\n\nPresent Situation and Reflections\n\nFast forward to the present, and as I reflect on what he shared about having PTSD, I decided to make more deliberate efforts to support him. I've been researching the topic extensively and have learned several important things. I’ve changed the way I communicate with him to ensure he doesn’t feel pressured to open up about his feelings. I’m also learning to give him space, even if that means waiting days for a response because I understand how difficult it must be for him. Additionally, I’ve started recognizing his boundaries, which means accepting that he doesn’t like to delve into his emotions or share details about how he feels.\n\nMy Concerns and Questions\n\nThis is the short version of our story, but you might wonder why I’m sharing this now. Despite these changes, I still feel like I’m not doing enough for him. I’d love to know if I’m on the right track or if there’s more I should be doing. I’m also looking for advice on how I should treat him or what I could adjust to make things better. If anyone has book recommendations or resources that could help me understand him further, I’d greatly appreciate it.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

        "Text": "⚠️ CW : discussion of death, childhood neglect, psychological abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, ED, SH, one mention of SA ⚠️\n\na summary of my story (DON’T HAVE TO READ IT JUST MIGHT PROVIDE INSIGHT):\ni have been diagnosed with chronic dissociative post-traumatic stress disorder, which my psychiatrist believes i developed at age seven; however, i began treatment at age sixteen. at age seven, i watched my mother die of a sudden-onset brain aneurysm when she was 49-years-old. a few weeks prior, i got in an argument with my mother where i told her i hated her, which has lead me to blame myself for her death ever since. simultaneously, it lead to the development of trauma-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder due to my separation anxiety from her within a sole six months of her passing, constantly feeling as though “something bad would happen to her.” in my youth, i was rejected by my peers and heavily disciplined by my teachers due to my sensitivity, being told that i needed to “get over it” by one of the educators within six months of her passing. at the point of six months post-mortem of my mother, my previously infatuated father began an off-and-on relationship with a woman who he often beat in front me despite engagement to her within another six months. she would abuse amphetamines, cocaine, alcohol, and likely other substances: addictions which she would eventually infect my father with quite easily as he abused substances throughout his adolescent life. eventually they would break up, yet he continued his alcohol and stimulant addiction. she would spontaneously arrive at our door with intentions of getting back with my father, where he eventually began to abuse me as a result of “losing my computer” which he had drunkenly hidden from me, forgetting where. this was the worst occasion of physical abuse, which persisted in lighter amounts throughout years following, but eventually slowed down a considerable amount as a result of their relationship’s official end (which involved her shaking my sweet tooth, a message still plaguing me). around this age, i began to find that i was unloved and began participating in pro-anorexia media and self harm spaces online: contributing to the beginning my addiction despite my previous experiences with body dysmorphia as the thin child who believed they were completely average weight. my father, again, continued to abuse drugs but he still provided an alright environment that was mildly neglectful to an extent which i considered livable. going on for several years, he would take a turn for the worst upon the end of a long-term relationship with his ex-girlfriend whom cheated on him during his brief stay in hospital as he had an aortic aneurysm which nearly took his life (caused me to show extreme PTSD signs yet i received little assistance). from ages 9 through 11, i used my anorexic behaviors temporarily only to engage in them in order to maintain my relatively thin stature. i did not self harm often, but i would maybe a dozen times throughout these years. from ages 12-13, though, i gained a substantial amount of weight where i reached the largest i’ve ever been including today (which was hardly middle-average). through the pandemic, i indulged in spaces like eating disorder tumblr, eventually growing into twitter as i’d heard it had more toxic approaches to different forms of inspiration. i only gained weight despite my efforts until i reached my late thirteens. once i truly learned how to maintain a low calorie intake, i lost a substantial amount of weight which went unnoticed by my family, since they’d hardly seen me throughout these pandemic (my bad for the poor organization, this was something i figured id bring up as it shows my increased energy over time which contributed towards my self deprecating behaviors, never being hurtful to others). after my father’s aneurysm, he dove into heavily drug abuse, engaging in reckless paid sex and becoming extensively neglectful. during this extreme neglect, i tried substances in order to understand my father’s love of them, yet found they only worsened my now contamination-based OCD. CPS investigations became increasingly invasive of my class time in school. at fifteen, my life changed entirely within twenty four hours: my grandmother on my mother’s side of the family called me while in the car with one of my best friends, claiming i would be moving to a city nearly four-hundred miles away to reside with my aunt and uncle. saying goodbye to my lifelong friends, who were my sole source of understanding and love throughout the seven years of mediocre to severe neglect, until the witching hour lead me to pulling an all nighter where i pierced my eyebrow six times for the hell of it to indulge in socially acceptable self harm. my aunt and uncle were initially suspicious that i abused substances much like my father, which was entirely incorrect. after little involvement in their family lives and a lack of acceptance of my new home, they discovered my lock box filled with substances i simply enjoyed keeping around as a safety tool to assure my OCD that i hadn’t taken any substances, as i know that i would only take my own. i kept obsessive counts: 42 hydrocodone pills, 4 unidentified pills found on my kitchen floor, 1 codeine pill found in the same room, a full zip of marijuana, 2 LSD gel tablets, and two half-bars of psilocybin edibles. they confronted me and attempted to cancel my birthday party where i would finally return home to see all of my friends for a night, which i don’t blame them for, but they handled it by telling me of all of the risks which i brought to “their” family by having these substances despite nothing bad every happening. my uncle ended the phone call with my aunt, whom was at her workplace participating in the discussion via skype, telling me that i was allowed to live with others if i believed it would benefit my progress. additionally, they would search my room endlessly for months, eventually finding an angry note i’d written requesting to live with my friends’ mothers back home. revising this note and leaving it on the dining table after my baby cousin fell asleep, when they got in a heated argument telling me to leave but gaslighting me telling me i wasn’t told to do so meanwhile requesting my belongings ( not drugs, as my uncle had flushed all of them down the toilet, but my phone and plushies ) back. i was grounded and told i would be “treated like i was in prison” for three weeks. every wednesday morning, they had cleaners come to their home and clean our beds and sweep the downstairs floors. the morning after the large argument, i forgot to take my pillow case off of my pillow and my uncle picked me up from school stating that i would not have my pillow for the remainder of the week as a result of my actions. it took them three months to get me a doctors appointment, where i was finally prescribed prozac and diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. i would attend talk therapy for about about a month and a half but eventually got laid off because i was too complex, which was perfectly alright because i detested my talk therapist and i already received a referral to the child studies center for assessment. i was finally diagnosed with PTSD and started CBT really quickly since my psychiatrist made a special request to book me as we’re extremely similar. by the time i began CBT, though, we had another argument as i had gone back home for winter break when i lied about the location i was at to my father since i wanted to spend the night with my ex-boyfriend ( IN A NONSEXUAL WAY!!!!! ).  i was, once again, grounded for another three weeks. my uncle told me he was going to search my phone until the beginning of its existence, forcing me to own up to all of my SI incidents (which had more recently occurred only nights before coming home from winter break because i was so afraid of my punishment, but i was staying at my other aunts home where she allowed me to have my phone from 6 PM through sleep), eating disorder, all of my friends’ drug use, bisexuality, eating disorder space accounts, and other issues which i feared needed to be addressed. i told my uncle every potential secret i had from kisses i shared to every instance of abuse i endured to my ex’s visa status (iykwim). he told me that i would be punished if i forgot anything, which was clearly another example of misconduct from my perspective. i forced my ex to tell his mother that he had smoked weed as my uncle told me he would tell his mother, along with the parents all of my other friends who smoked. eventually, i was ungrounded and things were going great despite my extreme paranoia about doing anything “wrong,” which brought my to apply to the best junior-and-senior high school in my state. during spring break, i went back home with my current boyfriend by my side. my father had lead my entire family to believe in his sobriety but it was apparent upon his arrival to their home that he was not sober. this brought discomfort to my partner and i, but we stuck it out as long as we could until my boyfriend experienced a freak incident where he found heroin needles in the cushioning of his hotel room (to be clear, my father doesn’t use heroin and he had not been in my boyfriend’s hotel room), when his father decided to pick him up at three in the morning as my father was evidently coked-up and didn’t inform any other adults of the incident. when i was home during this break, i performed in complete honesty, but i told my father about my uncle’s poorly-calculated actions in tears, causing his drunken self to threaten them. i would later be told by my guardians that i must go see my other aunt, which i saw during winter break, where i was informed that there would be potential that i was being kicked out (not from my guardians, but from my grandmother who lives nearby my aunt i was staying with for an intended short period). i would, the next day, receive a call that “as a result of my actions” i would no longer be welcomed into their home. now, i live with the aunt which i was supposed to be staying with for a short period. i have maintained a vastly healthy relationship with my now long-distance boyfriend despite our mental health conflicts and geographical separation. the only issue i have here is that my aunt used to be very aware of my psychological state, but she has recently fallen into a very apathetic state with all of the people in her life (which, in my pretty well-studied opinion, is a result of her constant switch in SSRIs. i still refuse to believe i didn’t do something wrong) leading us to argue much more frequently. that’s all i’ve gone through so far, i suppose. i know that’s quite long, but it is genuinely a summary of most of what ive experienced and what has stood out to me. \n\nsymptoms:\ntoday, i find it nearly impossible to accept love, as most of the experiences ive endured have shown me that feelings of love from other will change in an instant and are nearly never strong. i feel as though there’s something wrong with my character, that others don’t see my innocence, and i’m perceived as evil. i can hardly accept love from my aunt, despite her housing me and providing me with food, driving me twenty five minutes to school each morning, and taking me out occasionally for hang outs with friends. i know she doesn’t love me as though i am her daughter, as the things she is reluctant to do for me are things she would never question doing for her biological son. i have a feeling that the “love” others feel towards me is the pride they feel in the ability to take out their anger on me. today, my grandmother cornered me (in an argument with my aunt which she had no potential clue of the derivative of since it was held in the car home from school after i was triggered since i thought my aunt was angry with me) because i told her that she was being disrespectful towards me, accidentally penetrating her arm with my nails. it was entirely an accident and i immediately rushed to my room to gash my arm far worse than i’d cut hers (to make myself hurt more in physical pain out of guilt for hurting someone as my father had hurt me). i often feel as though i am extremely unlikable despite my often-complimented fashion sense and dedication to academics because the people around me can tell that i am “evil.” i just want to accept the love of my aunt and boyfriend, i know it would bring me to treat them better rather than avoiding them out of a fear of abandonment, but i can’t stop it. it is my birthday, but i don’t want to grow older because adults are perceived as more corrupt than children. i try so hard to give what i can: working wage-less at their restaurant as a waitress whenever possible (by choice), avoiding eating food to lower my cost of living, paying for my thrifted clothing with tips, etc. i just don’t know how to be more lovable. i haven’t found anybody at my local highschool which i find a true connection with that can be maintained (the first one SAed me and the last one cuts off our friendship every two weeks because he is bipolar but he doesn’t seem to notice nor care). if anybody has advice on overcoming this or even feels similar, please share. i want to know that im not alone in this. thank you all",

First I need to share my backstory. \n\nTimeline: \n1: starting my senior year my mom had a restriction on her nursing license which prohibited her to work. She took her anger out on me for months. I felt unloved, and I felt like I was failing. So my mental started to decline. \n2: I lost my best friend due to her obsession with boys. \n3: I ended up breaking my elbow towards the end of seniors year which stopped me from dancing, and running track which is something I loved. I couldn’t even do my school work I almost failed. This killed me because I am a perfectionist. \n4: during my injury I found out I was pregnant by my boyfriend at the time. My parents were very disappointed. I felt like I lost myself. I ended up getting an abortion. This took a toll on my heart. \n5: I struggled with hypsexuality due to my trauma as a child. So i struggled with infidelity I knew it would always catch up to me but my mind was clouded. The enemy had a hold on me.\n6: the summer before college I hung out with the wrong crowd I started going to parties drinking smoking. I hated myself. \n7: I started college and immediately began to go to parties and drink a ton, and lie to my boyfriend while doing so. I became a dark person. My friends encouraged a lot of this behavior. I ended up cheating and he found out and tried to kill himself. \n8: he wanted to work it out but then he would break up with me multiple times to have sex with other females. \n9: he ended up getting my pregnant again but he didn’t wanna keep it cause I cheated. He broke up with me on Christmas that year. I was devastated because all I wanted to do was fix it. I was ashamed in myself I was doing everything to show him that I was willing to chance. It was too late ig. I had to get a medical abortion on new years of 2024. It was so painful more than anything in my life. I suffered for hours alone during this process while the father was out at a party. I felt abandoned by everyone. Nobody checked up on me\n10: not to long after this I lost my grandma to cancer. I was devastated but I only cried once. \n11: I was on campus in a dorm everyday depressed for the remainder of the semester. I found out the boyfriend cheated during finals too lol. \n12: some time throughout this time my mom told me that she loves me but she doesn’t like me. That broke my heart. Never got an apology.\n13: I started taking lions mane mushrooms which has brought back memories of sexual assault as a child. It’s heavy on my heart. I can’t remember a lot of my childhood but things are starting to come back.\n\n\nSo overall the past two years have been mentally draining, and traumatizing. I’ve been in a state of stress for a while. Since then I’ve transferred to a different school closer to home to behave better. I’ve been single and improving mentally. I got closer to God and myself. I got my cna license and got a really good job. I’ve been reading more and doing more peaceful things. I cut off the bad influences in my life. I overall changed my lifestyle. I never got the chance to open up to anyone or get the help that i needed so I’m very isolated im very bitter at a lot of people. My heart is still hurting so I hope someone reads this and understands how I feel. I want someone to know I’m trying. ",

The point being that even though I have not specifically done EMDR before, I am certainly not a noob when it comes to trauma therapy in general. \n\nI started with a new therapist in February. I’m not a huge fan of her’s but she does EMDR so I’ve stuck it out with her. When I first approached her I told her that EMDR was where my interests are focused. Now, I understand that there needs to be some time to set up the groundwork but The problem I’m having is that here we are 10 months into therapy and there is yet to be a single mention of EMDR. Instead we seem to be following a set cookie cutter style of program she created that has me repeating steps and ‘lessons’ I’ve already done like CBT techniques and etc. I’ve expressed my frustration with her but she insists we carry on this way and I just feel like I’m spinning my wheels here. \n\nSo my question is, I know that laying the groundwork for EMDR takes some time but isn’t ten months with no end in sight excessive?

Sometimes they'll randomly feel things (but they describe it as still being like a drop of what that emotion should feel like) and mostly in more recent years they just experience stress and anger. They also will sometimes know how they want to feel about something, or what they think they would feel if their body worked how is used to (happens with sadness, joy, passion, drive, love) but they just can't actually find the feeling. \n\nI have cptsd but have not had this as a symptom, and I'm looking for ways to support them through this. Also looking for potential treatments to recommend them, they are seeking therapy at the moment. \n\nIt's starting to affect their desire to be in a relationship, because they said it's heartbreaking for them to not get to actually feel the love I give to them, and not fully feel the love they have for me. They said they feel like they have to try and force themself to feel feelings that aren't actually there, even though I've assured them that I love them regardless of how they show up, and am not needing or expecting them to change. I think if I was able to make them truly feel supported, that feeling of needing to \"force it\" would be less present. We have a wonderful relationship otherwise, and they have expressed to me many times that they've never been able to love someone like they love me. I know there's love, trust, and safety there, they just can't always feel it the way they want to. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for all kinds of advice. Of course I don't want to break up with them, so that's part of my motivation, but we have both made it clear that we will be in eachothers lives regardless, we are best friends. I just want to know how to best support them regardless of what happens in our relationship. And would also love resources or pointers I can share with them, to help them process all of this. It's heartbreaking to know that they only feel like a small fraction of who they are.   ",

        "Text": "My PTSD (technically complex PTSD due to the cumulative bad experiences I had afterwards) was caused by the sudden death of my dad when I was 18. This impacted me a lot because I am autistic so I relied on him heavily to feel safe in this world. Since his death I have simply not felt safe in this world, I have lost my sense of self, and I have felt so stuck. The cumulative bad experiences afterwards include narcissistic abuse, a severe suicide attempt, being in remand in prison, and more. My PTSD has become progressively worse over time. I was initially told by my community psychiatrist that EMDR is not the correct therapy for me because the root cause of my PTSD was my dad’s death. I agreed and she instead suggested schema therapy. Due to being involved in the criminal justice system recently due to my mental health, I will be receiving psychological therapy from a different service instead. I have been suggested that CAT (cognitive analytical therapy) combined with EMDR might help me. I am confused because I was initially told EMDR would not help me, but that may be one that is suggested by this service. Does anyone know or have experience of EMDR helping with my causes of PTSD? I agree that CAT could help me and I am keen to do EMDR since I have heard very positive things about it but I want to know if it can be effective for me. I will add that I will have a support worker for 8 hours a week in the future to help me manage my daily life. I also have autism, ADHD, and anorexia. I am unsure what therapy is best for me. ",

        "Text": "Hi, so without getting into heavy details, I'll give you my background and my current situation. I (32f) am diagnosed with c-PTSD because of the following: \n- Domestic violence between and from parents\n- Parent in prison\n- Murder committed by one parent \n- Emotional and psychological abuse from both parents \n- Neglect and parentification\n- Sexual abuse and sexual assault \n- Domestic violence from a past partner \n\nSorry, that's a lot to read to start off with, hence the content warning. So basically I've been in therapy for a looong time and I was doing a lot better. I'm not currently in therapy because it's completely incompatible with the hours I'm at university and the time I'm working. I had always wanted to be a teacher but I kinda... never wanted to be responsible for a kid's well-being for fear of f*cking up and traumatising them. I've come a really long way, and decided this year to do teacher training (high school and post-high school levels), because I felt like I had worked through everything and could do a decent job of it. \n\nOn the teacher training course at university, we have courses in psychology, sociology and pedagogy, and during these lessons we go into depth on these contexts for teenagers and how we can support teenagers, aside from teaching them the subject we're specialised in. It's super interesting and extremely important. I enjoy these classes in the sense that I feel like they are preparing me to be a good teacher and safe/trained adult for kids I teach in the future. It's important to me that I'm fully prepared because my own teachers (for lack of training or knowledge) kinda failed me in some ways. \n\nSo here's the problem. After almost every psychology and sociology class, I find myself crying in the car on the way home. I've started to have nightmares about hypothetical students being abused and not being able to help them. I think it's pretty clear that this is triggering something in me that I thought I had pretty much dealt with and it's making me wonder if I should abandon the idea of being a teacher, at least to high school kids. One thing that's clear to me is I probably need to go back to therapy as soon as I can make it work with my schedule. I feel like I'm managing okay using the strategies I've learned, I'm just worried that if I'm triggered like this, am I going to be able to support kids when they need it? \n\nThis training also qualifies me to teach adult learners too and to teach in other contexts, so that's maybe what I should aim for, or maybe this is just at first and with time it'll get easier.\n\nAnyway, I'm just wondering if anyone here is a teacher and has experienced this, or still does?

Not necessarily positivity, but just any words from someone who’s made it through. \n\nIt’s not often I can honestly talk about what happened to me because it never feels socially appropriate. About a year and a half ago I lost all of my lifelong best friends in about an hour-long phone call. Just imagine all the closest people in your life called you up to tell you you’re an awful person, and then stopped talking to you forever.\n\n I don’t know how or why it happened, and I thought I was a good friend. \n\nThe event has had horrible impacts on my life in college. I can barely able to talk to people. I haven’t made any friends since the event, and I cry almost every night about how lonely I’m getting. I constantly feel like I’m a liar and a fraud.\n\nI have frequent nightmares where everyone else I love just does the same thing to me. They even happen about people I barely know. I consider myself pretty good at dealing with bad times, but I just can’t take it any more. I feel like I’m pretending to be a human being. I feel like all my beliefs about being a good person are just grotesque misinterpretations of what everyone else is doing. Nobody around me has ptsd, so I feel alone in my experience. I hate pictures of myself, I especially hate old pictures of myself, and I don’t see myself when I look in the mirror. I just feel infinitely heartbroken, unreal, and almost delusional to be honest. I could cry for years.  \n\nI go to therapy twice a week, including EMDR therapy, and I feel like my therapists just never seem to know what to say to me. I can say what’s on my mind, but an hour is never enough to make progress. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. I am still so sensitive. I just want to be able to try again with new people, but my body and mind don’t allow it. I feel like I’m fighting against something that does not exist. I don’t even think about them often, but I know my pain today is because of what happened. I feel nothing like the person I used to be. \n\nI do not want to forget what happened. Of course I’m upset now, but at the very least I don’t want to retroactively sour my memories of them. These people made me who I am. I don’t want to be angry, I just want to move on to feel like a human being again. At least if I feel normal I can start over. \n\nPlease, I need anything that I’m not going to hear from a regular person. I know there is potential for things to get better for anyone, but I just need to hear something from someone who actually knows what it feels like to be frozen in the most horrifying moment of your life for months.

When my little brother was born, my mom stopped any chance of me bonding with him and told me I was bad with babies and wouldn't let me get close with him.  It greatly affected our relationship for until he was like 6.  It also negatively affected my own view of myself and my abilities.  I've always loved kids.  In a lot of ways I feel like I am willing to be silly with them more than other adults.  I love Minecraft, I'm not scared to get messy playing in the sand, and I have an imagination much like a child's.  I always thought I was great with kids but my mom's negativity made me scared of being close to a baby.\n\nTonight, my sister let me be the first person (besides her and her husband) to put my niece to sleep.  And it went amazing.  She barely fussed.  It didn't take long for her to fall asleep.  She looked for my sister for a second but quickly settled in.  We have a great bond.  The first time she laughed was at me.  She's only 9 months old but it's so healing interacting with her and proving to myself that I am not what my mom told me.  I know now the real problem was just that I was 10 and had never been around babies and instead of taking the time to help me form a bond with him I was just told to go away.  But now my brother is 14, I'm 24 and even though we had a rough first 6 years we are incredibly close.  I'm so thankful everyday for the bond I was able to form with him.  And I'm so happy my niece loves me already :) every time I hold her a feel a part of me healing.\n\nSide note, my niece hates my mom.",

        "Text": "Hey, peeps, I hope you're all doing well and on your way to healing. I wanted to post a thought here because I've been trying to analyze PTSD from the inside. As in, having it and understanding how it affects me by studying the hell out of it all along the way and applying what I've learned to how I behave. I've been noticing something that has escaped me for some time and I might be on to something here. I wanted to share this with all of you in hopes that it might ring a bell and provide some insight to something unnoticed in PTSD.\n\nSo, what I've been noticing, has something to do with that 1000 yard stare that many with PTSD have. The afflicted usually have trouble understanding what's going on around them and get \"Stuck in their heads\" a lot. This is where grounding techniques come in to play to bring people back in to the real world (being present) to feel safe. However, this contrast of \"being present \"and \"being stuck in our heads\" is what I think I've been able to identify.  I fully feel this has to do with some sort of \"visual cortex impairment\" caused by a traumatic situation. \n\nTrigger warning: I'll use a soldier's perspective for example. they see some shit. blood, guts, death, murder, suicide, all ages, innocent, guilty, it's absolute chaos. it's mind numbing and traumatizing. but imagine this. all that chaotic visual stimulation that makes the soldier go mad, I believe, fries the soldier's visual cortex and it stops processing what it sees. this might cause some sort of inactive visual cortex condition and I feel this might have gone unnoticed as I have never heard of anything like this in my 35 years of having PTSD and speaking with doctors, therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. I've never read anything like this in books, on the internet, or heard of it from other afflicted people.\n\nThank you for reading this. I hope some sort of doctor comes by and reads this and keeps in to consideration. I do hope this is an actual condition. because if it is, it can be healed. I'm mostly posting this because i've been noticing lately that i've been able to understand the world around me better (i've been doing lots of new therapies that have been working lately) and i've been feeling a weird buzzing/tingly feeling in the back of my head right around where the visual cortex is. I'm wondering if it's been shut off somehow due to my trauma and is slowly coming back. would be great if this was true. Thank you and have a great day!",

I told him and he instantly changed and venomously threatened me into abortion day and night saying he would make my life hell for the rest of my life if I don't take an abortion pill. Believing i could be free from him I took the abortion pill. It was traumatic and I suffered severly emotionally, thinking I would never get past it. After I did it, he tried to ghost me and never paid his part. He waited some time and cycled back around and started love bombing and saying he did love me, but he had to show me that I would never control him and he was in control so that is why he did everything he did.\n\nFast foward 3 months and i was working everyday on healing and reading through relationship abuse and recovery books. I went to the obgyn for a checkup and she tells me I have been infected from him and have HSV, incurrable. I have cried and cired and felt it couldn't get worse and it did. I reached out to him asking did he know and why did he do that. More or less he said yea he knew, and he didn't care, didn't think it was a big deal for me to know. He said I am stuck with him now as nobody will ever want me again.\n\nI have cried every single day and just feel so traumatized. The rape, the abortion, the incurable infection.

I recently had a situation where (cw: suicide) >!i found my mom’s body after her attempted suicide!< I hastily downloaded a Tetris app and played for a little bit. I know how I react to past events and I can look upon this moment without any negative responses. It’s not that I don’t feel anything, just not as intense or severe. Keep this idea in your back pocket! ",

        "Text": "I know i'm probably being too harsh on myself and there absoutely no red flags with my therapist, the problem is litterally me! \n\nI need to explain it here because i can't verbalise it in therapy right now, just need some support on what to do from here please. \n\nSo, the worst of the triggers is the CSA which i will spoiler for safety. But the post will talk about physical assault aswell both historical and more recent. \n\nHonestly, its like i've been thrown through a loop recently. I've been doing well to process traumas with a therapist over 60hours worth of therapy sessions at least 40 of them around regulation/trauma processing etc the rest just keeping things going and learning how to safeguard against winter mood changes as i also have bipolar with seasonal affect. \n\nAbout 7 weeks ago i was grabbed by the neck by a patient and they also trapped me in a corner and aimed to punch me in the face. I did get out the room though i don't really remember how right now but i did. \n\nI have since had about 4 panic attacks at work due to feeling like things have gone wrong  being triggered by something someone has said i.e. one patient explained in detail how he was assaulted as a kid (11 yrs old). I was around a similar age when the most traumatic epiosde of CSA happened. \n\nMy therapist asked me last week if i knew why the attack had set off these symptoms recently and i do know but i can't voice it, she knows vaguly what happened but not details and i just can't explain it verbally. I tend to shutdown verbally when this is triggered. But i can write things down to get things out and it helps somewhat. \n\nDetail is spoilered below. \n\n>!so i remember being pinned to a wall being assaulted around 10yrs old, felt a hand on the back of my neck, i remember the feeling of my head being held down and being forced to give oral (this appears to have happened multiple times at this age and later at 13/14  but i don't know how many as most of this is body memories, one was a boyfriend when i was around 13/14, i remember being scared and him forcing me to touch him and hold my head down by my neck!<\n\nThere is also something when i was around 21 i was living with a friend we both the same sex (female) and she became abusive and she used to hit me in the face for sleeping, once that i remember she tried to strangle me and then kicked me in the ribs as i was on the floor and she was enraged. \n\nAround the time i was 29 i went out for a coffee date with someone from work (worked on the same hospital site) we ended up at his flat in which he assaulted me and locked me in his flat with him, again i don't really remember all of it. \n\nBarely anyone really knows any of this apart from the thing that happened at work as it was witnessed by collegues.\n\nI absoutely hate people touching my neck, i can't have it, my therapist also thinks i'm autistic which could be part of the issue aswell. \n\nI can't seem to ground, stop the flashbacks or panic attacks so i have been to my doctors to adjust my medications to see if this helps and i'm working with my therapist about the new symptoms i'm struggling with, i am practicing self care as much as i can. \n\nBut i'm really questioning why i'm reacting so badly, if its all really worth it if i'm going to feel this bad forever. It feels like two years ago again where i was first diagnosed and its hard to go back there. I keep telling myself that we are in a better position now but its hard to believe it when i can feel everything happening to my body all over again and its affect sleep/eating/work. \n\nIf anyone has any advise i would be greatful. Sorry for the long post and in seperate places i'm really struggling with everything. \n\n\n",

        "Text": "I'm using a translation, so please let me know if there are any problems.\n\nI think I have CPTSD (not officially diagnosed).\n\nThe direct trauma flashbacks I mentioned in the title are ones where the trigger reminds you of the trauma (e.g. drawing is related to the trauma, so drawing directly reminds you of the traumatic memory), and images or other things come to mind, or you simply feel emotions such as fear.\n\nIn other words, they are something that makes you very conscious of the trauma in some way.\n\nOn the other hand, I understand emotional flashbacks to mean \"there is no traumatic memory or image involved in the trigger or flashback process, but you have stronger negative emotions than necessary due to the influence of old trauma.\"\n\nI am more tormented by things that directly remind me of the trauma.\n\nFor example, when I look at (C)PTSD-related threads on Reddit, I often see emotional flashbacks being said to be \"opportunities to heal old traumas.\"\n\nAlso, as in the above example, it seems that there is no denying that whether it is a trigger or an emotional flashback itself, it is not denied that it is possible to actively overcome it.\n\nAlso, it seems that one of the characteristics is that \"if you recognize what the trigger is, the symptoms will calm down.\"\n\nHowever, if it is something that directly reminds you of the trauma, there seems to be an atmosphere that there is no solution, or that the solution is something like mindfulness (which I cannot use due to circumstances).\n\nIn short, compared to things that do not directly remind you of the trauma, such as emotional flashbacks, it seems to be more severe and there are fewer treatments. Also, when it comes to things that directly remind you of the trauma, I felt that there was an atmosphere that \"the right thing to do is to avoid them,\" rather than to overcome them.\n\nDo you think the impression I stated above is correct? (I don't know much about CPTSD, so there is a good chance I'm wrong.) Also, whether it's correct or not, I would appreciate it if you could tell me how it is different specifically.\n\nAlso, there may be some depictions that may offend someone, so if there are any, I would appreciate it if you could let me know.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Some back story about us, when I was in 1st grade I met this girl and we started dating in middle school, we didn’t last long as I found out that I was gay (I had always known I liked boys and girls but that changed) we were able to stay really good friends and I spent the night at her house a lot, she had a 21 year old brother. Even though I was young I thought he was very attractive, he’s tall, slim, strong, and very nice, well nice at first. He always had friends over while I was there, as you can guess he was the one that raped me, it wasn’t only him, his friends would watch and please themselves to us, some times even join. Recently the restraining order I had on him expired and I’ve been seeing him around town more (he moved a town over when i filed for the restraining order) I had always seen him around but if we were near each other he would leave (due to the restraining order) but now he stays and will even try to get closer. The problem is I’m not scared to see him anymore and it kind of makes me feel like I want to try and work it out with him, I know it’s wrong and my thoughts of wanting him make me more scared than the fact that we can and would hurt me again. I’m 6’1 and 280 pounds so I could definitely put up a fight now but he’s the exact same as when I was a 5’4 200 pound 15 year old. He’s literally the exact same 6’8 265ish pounds. He’s a lot stronger than me too. All of this is hard for me to think about but I always forgive everyone, I’ve always been very forgiving and I have forgave him. I would usually ask my therapist what to do but times are hard and I had to decide between my house or my therapist and the house won. Can anyone try to help me with a way I can get over this? I know people get attached to their abusers but I can’t find anything that has actually helped.",

A few days ago I read a blog post from an Ukrainian veteran who was dealing with ptsd in his own way.

She's always been supportive. \n\nPain from so deep down I would never have imagined it could be there, just poured out with the tears and snot for more than an hour. Never had such an immensly intense, deep down crying episode before, total emotional purification and drainage, leaving me feeling almost dehydrated in the end. \n\nWhen it was over, I could breath and taste fresh air again for what felt like the first time in a decade, I never noticed that was an issue before. Visited my parents, and mum flat out said she saw something had changed, that I was shining more, held myself higher and such.   \n  \nToday when out on a walk, I decided to visit some old friends on a whim, something I haven't done for more than a decade(unless there's been an invite), just walking up to their door and entering, and was greeted with hugs, cake and coffee.  \n\nThat Ukrainian will never know how much he helped me with his words, I just hope he also gets help himself. \n\nI now doubt if I'm fully recovered, as there may always be something deeper down, but I'm in a much better place all the same.

But here I'm kind of divided, for some reason I don't know why I either think this person was doing something inappropriate whilst also playing around/grabbing my butt or something inappropriate was happening to someone else but I could hear it cause I was in the room but didn't do anything about it. I forgot to mention I'm around age 4-6 I believe and would often share rooms together with my older brother n sister to sleep who were only a few years older. I'm unsure wether either of these is true or not but what I will say is that my sister has said that she experienced something traumatic when she was a kid tho never told me but I'm really scared to ask her about this. Also this is kind of unrelated but I've had this kind recollection of these events before when I was watching this specific episode of Mr Robot season 4 for the first time, idk why but it felt like I could relate to Elliot and I was trying not to cry. Idk my body/skin felt kinda weird but at the time I brushed it off cause I thought I was just being an empath. But moving back, I have no memory of anything that happened from that event up until this one memory where I'm now 7-8, I was play fighting with another kid on a sofa where I suddenly remember a man who I think was one of my parent's friend grabbing me by the legs where my body is straight and my trousers slightly slipping revealing my butt in which he slaps, but I remember crying like crazy after that I went out to the garden and was crying by myself cuz I kinda felt violated until my dad came to the garden and consoled me. Yeah idk man I guess kind of always hated when people doing things butt related to me to the point where now (fuck I feel so weird writing this) I might have a kink for it which is so weird for me. Not that there's anything wrong with it but I'm not homosexual by any means I've always been attracted to women and get instantly bricked seeing a hot women which made me always confused having this kink for \"butt stuff\". Also I'm not sure if this has any link but me being 20 now I'm kinda also attracted more towards older more mature women like 26 27 to 45 idk why also growing up I did kinda latch on to maternal figures especially teachers during school. I though of them hugging me and looking after me yh idk why I'm so cooked. Forgot to mention but I also kinda knew what sex was at a young age obviously not in specifics but like I tried I guess \"experimenting\" very young, though I didn't exactly know how to masterbate I remember just playing with myself and my butt in secret as a kid, I also knew about porn at a very young age (5 probably) because my dad forgot to delete his history on the phone one time and my brother showed it to me.\n\nDid happen (vivid memories) :I remember three specific occasions my parents had violent fights. It would always happen at night and I was always be awake. I slept with my parent's on the same bed up until I was 12 maybe 13. I can remember each 3 in detail but for now I'll explain one. I was woken up to them bickering but quietly. I was next to my mom and she was next to my dad, and I remember him punching her with a full blown fist twice maybe even 3 times very hard, he punched her where his fist would meet her forehead/eye socket/nose I remember I got up slightly to see her I couldn't do anything say anything and I still remember the look she gave me, the look she had in her eyes with tears before she got up and starter crying behind a cupboard I was awake the whole night angry frozen and cried myself to sleep. I'm also a nighowl with a really bad sleep schedule this could be the reason why. I also remember another fight where my dad was drunk was fighting my mom and also took it out on my sis who was just sleeping, I saw him punch her in the head really hard to the point she said she couldn't see anything for a few secs, again I was awake I knew what was happening but again couldn't do anything which I now feel so shit for.\n\nUnrelated but this how I am now, people have told me I'm very nice n kind specially during school but to me I just thought that was just how you had to be, that I'm very patient like scary patient again I'm not too sure what that means I was also quite emotional as a kid like I never cried in school but at home sometimes even a joke from a sibling would feel like a personal attack and I would bawl my eyes out not sure why but yeah. If you read this much thank-you so much and I appreciate the fuck outta you ❤",

My mother stayed vague about it. She didn't want to tell me more of it and I never discussed it with my sibling. \n\nI wonder if what happened to her happened to me as well and now is coming back in dreams? \n\nI have a lot of anxiety, anger and other negative feelings when I think it could have happened. Also I have no proof and no memory of it, so it could just be the thought that work me up like this. \n\nOverall my question is could this dream come from an event that I have absolutely no recollection of, or is it just a metaphor or an abstract thought made up in my mind for something unrelated?

I have one amazing friend that I've known for years, and also happens to have PTSD from her boyfriend beating her for a couple of years.\n\nWhat predicated my diagnosis was the fact that 10 years ago I was stalked and hand delivered a death threat from a guy on the other side of the country. 4 months ago said friend was found and contacted through my social media, the same way I was (but it was for a romantic interest from the owner of an establishment I was friendly with and went multiple times a week).\n\nMy therapist is my psychiatrist and caught on real quick after everything went down and fought to get my slot in. Now that I'm going into week three, she has told me that it's one of the roughest sessions and that she's cleared time in her schedule to contact me, and has advised me to take the day off, and potentially the day after.\n\nWe were supposed to take a trip yesterday together to pick up some stuff I bought on eBay (4 hours each way) and make a night out of it, but she wasn't feeling well the morning of and stayed back. I came back and she felt better, so we went to the gym and I went hard- twice as hard as I usually do so I was really sore.\n\nWe went back to her place and I wanted to take a shower, but couldn't find my towel that I travel with. I started to get frustrated because I knew it was there, I just saw it that morning before I left.\n\nI started to get extremely angry and was tearing my car apart trying to find it, so I went back into her room to look in my bag and started slamming doors.\n\nThe look of terror on her face is embedded in my brain. I see it every time I close my eyes. I could barely sleep, and had to take a sleeping pill.\n\nShe asked me earlier in the night to take her to the store, and I did. On the way back I asked if she would be more comfortable if I left, and she yelled Yes before I finished the sentence, but made some story about how she needed to study and wanted to focus on that. It was clear she was lying, so I left.\n\nToday we were texting and she said I can come down if I wanted to but I just don't feel comfortable there. I don't get angry often but the therapy is extremely rough and I know this week will be rougher, so it's been on my mind. \n\nAny tips on this? I've messaged my provider about this but it being Sunday and tomorrow being a holiday, I'm not sure what to do. I'm supposed to be down there Tuesday to take her to a job interview- and she says she still wants me down there to take her. I think I'm just going to go and let her take my car to the interview since hers died this week, but I know after there's going to be some tension and between the fact that I hate that I was one of the few people she saw as safe and made her feel unsafe in her own home, I'm just lost.",

But i never had one singular extremely horrifiyng event happen to me, aside from, maybe, a few intense physical fights between family members which, although they happened in front of me, they didn't often actually involve me. It was scary nonetheless. Either way, in the hands of family members i would suffer much more mentally than physically, really. Nothing that bad ever happened to me. And yet, i often get the comment that i might have PTSD, because, according to people i know that are knowledgeable in PTSD, i exhibit symptoms. I am always tense and scared when i am at home, but going out often makes me anxious. Receiving affection and touch leaves me uncomfortable and nauseous. There are many things from my past i can't seem to remember. When i think about certain parts of my childhood, i feel out of breath and nauseous. Hearing the sound of doors unlocking/opening, hearing footsteps, hearing a knock at my door all puts me in a fight or flight state, and i always recognize who it is that's doing each of these things, without needing to look. I'll often spend the majority of my free time in maladaptive daydreaming (in fact, i could easily spend all day doing just that). I can't handle hearing loud noises (specially people screaming) because it makes me panic and puts me in fight or flight mode, regardless if it is directed at me or not. When under intense pressure or stress, i'll often dissociate and \"autopilot\" my way through life. \nThese are some aspects that friends have pointed out, but i always deny the possibility of having PTSD. Again, nothing that bad ever happened to me, so i can't help but think that's not really it. It's hard for me to even refer to my family as \"abusive\" or call myself \"traumatized\", but the times i have vented about my life, those are always the terms used by others to refer to the situation. Today, at the breakfast table, my mother started talking about a story from my brother's childhood. As she spoke i remember having random thoughts and memory flashes that put me immediately into panic. Only now, over an hour later, i am beginning to calm down, but the detail of those thoughts i had seem to have vanished from my mind. I don't know if i'm just spiralling but i am finally starting to consider maybe i do have PTSD. I don't know. It feels weird to even say that... i can't help but feel guilt for thinking about it.",

        "Text": "warning for sexual violence and mentions of alcohol/eating disorders/self-harm\n\nFor context, I'm a 19 year old trans guy, and I have been struggling with sexual trauma for a few years. But I have never been \"fully assaulted\" if that makes sense.\n\nI've been sexually harassed many times to varying degrees, and the first time I can remember it happening is when I was around 8 or 9, when multiple boys who were slightly older called me a slut and a prostitute and tried to pressure me into taking my clothes off. I've been solicited for sex by adults since I was maybe 15 or 16 (often by other queer people, mostly cisgender gay men) and was briefly facing online stalking and harassment from a guy I later found out was a rapist who specifically targets trans boys. I've been constantly fetishized and sexually harassed for my transness, like people (often adults) demanding to know what genitals I have or how I masturbate, or people pressuring me into sex acts. I've also been victim to multiple attempts of people trying to groom me, and I've been shown porn without my consent a few times when I was underage, and have seen people expose themselves without my consent. This past summer I went on a date with a girl who was caressing my thighs and groping my muscles a lot, even though we had previously had a long conversation about how I don't like to be touched, especially in a sexual way, and the whole date just made me feel so disgusting that I still wish I didn't have to exist in a physical body. There are so many different things that have all added up to my sexual trauma, and I think I might be forgeting to mention some things I've experienced.\n\nA few months ago though, something happened which I would consider to be the \"most severe\" or at least for me the most traumatizing event. I don't want to get into a lot of detail, but it involved indecent exposure and me being made to watch group sex acts without my consent. This happened in a more quiet area near a Pride Fest, in an area where there were also kids. Right after it happened, I wanted to walk back to my hotel room, but I completely broke down and collapsed on the ground in front of a museum, and I sat there crying for an hour and more. Eventually two women came up to me who helped me walk back to my friends, and from there my friends were able to make sure I was safe. Before this happened, I had just started to try to start processing all my past sexual trauma and try to find a way to live despite the constant anger, disgust, fear and worthlesness I feel. \n\nSince this happened, I have just started to feel worse and worse. I'm having constant flashbacks that are so bad that I have had panic attacks where I thought I was going to die. I'm spiralling back into my eating disorder, some days I don't eat anything at all. I can't stop drinking alcohol, which is also something I have struggled with in the past because of queer party culture and excessive substance use being glorified in the community. Some days the first thing I do after getting out of bed is drink as much rum or brandy as I can before I start to feel sick, because its the only thing that i feel even remotely helps. (But I'm currently around 6 days sober.) My self-harm problems have gotten a lot worse. I'm scared to go outside, because I'm scared I will be harassed or violated. I live in constant fear of being assaulted or facing other forms of sexual violence, and it's all I can think about. I'm losing all of the joy from my life, I can no longer enjoy anything that used to make me happy, like makeup or fashion or just spending time with my friends. I'm so scared of being violated or harrased that most days I don't know how I will keep living, because I feel like it's inevitable that I will keep being harassed or assaulted. I keep having nightmares.\n\nI used to be hypersexual, kind of as a way to be in denial that I have any sexual trauma at all, and also because I felt like the only way I have worth is if other people are allowed to fetishize me or use me for sex. I thought I deserved to just feel horrible all the time and force myself to act sexual and do things I didn't actually want to do or feel comfortable doing. But now I can't even think about sex without feeling like I'm gonna have a panic attack.\n\nIn the gay community there's this attitude that sexual harassment and assault and abuse is just something that happens, that if you're a queer guy, you should just expect it because so many men (especially white cis gay men) feel entitled to other people's bodies and don't care about consent, age or how sober someone is. I'm terrified things like this will keep happening to me. And so many people act like it's normal, and I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just overreacting or being too sensitive.\n\nI often feel like what I've gone through isn't \"bad enough\" or that I'm weak for being this traumatised because I've never been r*ped.\n\nI guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has experienced something similar or feels like their trauma isn't \"bad enough\". I obviously don't wish my trauma was worse, but I just feel like I'm being too hyperbolic or sensitive when I say I've experienced sexual violence, and I feel like I'm not allowed to call myself sexually traumatised, since most of the time people assume that means I've been r*ped.

        "Text": "Hi everyone : )\n\nI got bullied very badly by a group of students in a university. They were from the same country. Several faculty were from the same country as well, and they turned a blind eye, with some of them even participating.\n\nThey bullied me because they were afraid I would complain about something one of them did. I didn't realize this for several months, because it hadn't occurred to me, given that as a student, you want to keep your head down and focus on your work.\n\nI was a quiet person and they said negative things about me. I didn't try to find out what was said, but it couldn't have had any basis in reality. The core students doing it were doing it maliciously, but they dragged some unsuspecting people into this business who didn't know better than to indulge rumor-mongering. It's so strange how people are taught in school to verify with evidence and consider all sides of the story, but they don't apply it in real life.\n\nIt happened all the time, inside and outside of class. They would whisper and laugh while I spoke, tell others to heckle me during my presentations, laugh in my face in public spaces, or change direction dramatically if I walked past. The campus was very small so I couldn't avoid them. They also said negative things about me to the faculty, I later found this out. It negatively impacted my ability to access the resources I needed. One faculty member - in whose class the complainable incident had happened, but to whom I had always been polite and never mentioned it - started making it a point to put me down publicly.\n\nThere was even more than this behaviour, but you get the general idea. I'm working on something related to the program and I've been getting a lot of flashbacks lately. It's like a punch to the chest. I'm haunted by the fact that I didn't speak up for myself so everyone probably assumed that the negative things being said were true. I actually didn't because I thought it would create a bigger mess. When I'd gone to the welfare team for help, they told me \"bullies have mental health too\", and tried to blame my stress as the cause rather than the symptom. It was the easy way out for them. That's because they can't do anything to stop it. It was mind-blowing to realize that you can be the person who gets punished for having a bad experience if you talk about it.\n\nI think what I'm looking for is closure. The public humiliation was painful. Not being able to speak about it and set the narrative straight was too. I'm struggling to heal because I never resolved the situation. It also hurts me a lot that the people who did all of this are happy and successful and will probably never realize what they did was wrong or experience any sort of consequences for how much pain they caused me. It's very difficult for me to make peace with this.",

Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.\n\nI’ve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school \"Jock”.\n\nHe always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).\n\nI get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he’s sorry (he’s said it so many times it doesn’t hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology \"I understand you probably hate my guts\".\n\nI accepted the apology because my dad told me to.\n\nSince then, I’ve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I’m not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.\n\nHe, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I’m doing well and he’s happy specifically for that.\n\nI just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said \"Man, I don’t remember saying that, clearly I did though, there’s no denying that photo. I honestly don’t remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that\". He also mentioned in the convo how I'm \"letting him take up way to much head space over this\".\n\nFor the sake of convenience of this post I’ll make it short. We went back and forth over it and he accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\\*\\*\\*d his ex and said how I can’t deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.\n\nI blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.\n\nHe says \"James, for the hundredth time, I’m done with these conversations. Chao for now\".\n\nI said \"for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can’t connect the dots on why you think it’s me who did that. Chao\".\n\nAfter a few days, I blocked him for good.",

Even my two roommates avoided me, leaving me feeling isolated. At one point, I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to confide in my homeroom teacher, sharing everything I was going through. After that, the experience left me with serious trauma.\n\nOn the way home, both my mom and dad were furious that I had opened up about my problems. They were worried that it might end up on my school record or that other teachers would find out. They yelled at me and even hurled insults I can’t bring myself to repeat. They said the teacher would now ignore and look down on me, even calling me a “stupid bitch” while they shouted at me. I don’t remember every detail of that day, but I remember crying and apologizing, saying I’d never do it again. They then turned the car around and drove me back to that awful high school, telling me everything was my fault. I was so shaken, and that night I couldn’t sleep, only praying that somehow I’d be able to go home.\n\nMy second trauma was when I attempted suicide. On the drive to the hospital, they yelled at me again, warning me not to call any suicide hotline because they didn’t want the school to find out. My mom even said she couldn’t understand why her daughter was like this and threatened that she might kill herself, too. She then screamed about how our entire family (including my sister, dad, and me) had tried to take our lives. I don’t remember much from that night either, just the lingering trauma it left behind. My hands trembling while i writing this. \n\nDespite all this, I still love my parents, but I fear what would happen if they were to change. I fear it is normal to parents did that to daughter.

I gave her all the money I had when I got there for anything needed. 1 week in I was sleeping on the couch, and the third week a cop was dropping her off at the main lobby of the apartment building. I confronted her and she kicked me out and took me to the bus station the next day. I had to say goodbye to the most important person in my life, my daughter.

For example: Walking down my child’s school hallway amongst tan lockers there would be one out of place blue locker with my old locker number on it. Another time an entire solid wall turned into full panes of glass overlooking a courtyard I once knew from childhood. Walking in the park but instead of only the normal lampposts there would be one lamppost from the town I grew up in, in a random spot. I feel like my current reality has been meshing/colliding with past memories. I should mention that I do sometimes hear/smell/feel things that aren’t actually there either. Does this all still fall under the flashback category for cPTSD? And why would the hallucinations start more recently rather than a closer timeframe to the traumatic events. Kinda feel like I’m slowly losing it. I can still reason with myself and recognize they are not supposed to be there, but it still stresses me out. ",

He coerced, groomed, and manipulated me into doing sexual things and made me feel guilty, convincing me that I had control over the situation, which led to shame. When he moved away, it stopped, but after we moved near him again, it started up again. I hated it but felt helpless. He often left me feeling confused, betrayed, and angry. He made me doubt myself, feel worthless, and destroyed my self-esteem. It was harder to speak out because he was someone I considered family. Over time, I started to numb myself and dissociate, especially during the abuse. I ended up in the hospital (but never spoke up). My mom asked if he had done anything to me, and then told me if I was having sex, she'd punish me, the same thing he had told me. It happened a few more times, then stopped when we moved. I was depressed and ashamed, wanting to hide. Life didn't get better; it got worse. I was severely bullied and felt alone and isolated. I went through everything on my own. The way I felt still sticks with me. I started therapy five years later after asking (my parents didn't put me in therapy, I had to do it myself). Event lly, I spoke about the abuse, and it got re ted, but now I wish  I could have spoken up sooner. It wasn't easy, and shame was my biggest emotion. I was ashamed to tell anyone about what happened, the bullying, and how much I hated myself. I'm trying not to let it weigh me down, but I'm just lost.",

        "Text": "Hi folks. I'm not sure how to best articulate this, but it's been going around and around in my head and I'm exhausted trying to understand myself.\n\nLong and short of it: I have diagnosed C-PTSD from a really rough childhood (physical, psychological, sexual abuse) but have grown up in a fairly stable liberal Western democracy. I have never seen war, famine, indiscriminate death. I have heard about such things from family (e.g., veterans, Great Depression survivors, etc.); I have read about such things extensively in my work as a researcher.\n\nWhat always strikes me is how *familiar* such accounts feel. I read Svetlana Alexeivich's /The Unwomanly Face of War/ (about female Red Army soldiers during WWII), I read about soldiers crawling through mud and blood and vomit to defuse mines, about partisans being tortured in Gestapo basements and I feel... familiarity. I read the anonymous journal published as /A Woman in Berlin/, about the bone-crushing ache of hunger and assault after the fall of Berlin, and I feel familiarity. I read about the experiences of soldiers after war, old or current, and I recognize the habits, the patterns, the triggers. And not just recognize them, I feel like I know them intimately -- a strong sense of \"yes, I know what that's like.\"\n\nBut biographically, I don't. Not in any first person way. So it always frustrates me, even embarrasses me, when I have this sense of recognition. It feels like stealing valor. Self-indulgent. Of course you can't know what that's like, I think. Of course you only have the illusion of familiarity. But it's there. Deep in my body. I walk around with a grief and a trauma in my body and brain that I've only ever seen mirrored in these sorts of accounts. And I just can't make sense of it. No amount of rationalizing or explaining makes it go away. I feel more like a soldier, a partisan, a survivor of abject horror more than like anyone around me; and I hate that I feel that. It seems strikingly disrespectful to people who have actually lived through such horrors.\n\nThe more I try to make sense of it -- something as far-fetched as past life memories? -- the more foolish it seems. But I just cannot shake it. My current theory is that it's just trauma recognizing trauma, and the language and narrative of war accounts is particularly similar to the kind of chaotic, hopeless uncertainty of my own traumatic circumstances. I once had a professor ridicule me for saying that post-trauma symptoms were interfering with my ability to perform music in front of an audience. \"People survived concentration and labor camps and could still play their instruments,\" he said. But I'm one of those people, I wanted to respond. Of course, I'm not. And I don't mean in any way to make light of appropriate the suffering of others. But years later, this feeling remains, and I'm still trying to make sense of it.",

I literally think about it almost every single day, counting down the days. I’ll wake up at 3am and have a panic attack over it like now. I feel mortified but I refuse to even get my height and weight checked. Even THAT just somehow makes me panic. I also had an eating disorder when I was younger and severe body dysmorphia from abuse. Anything and everything absolutely terrifies me. I’m absolutely TERRIFIED of needles and just cannot do it. I have prescription medication to help calm me down but I have no idea how to approach this to my doctor. She is nice so far and this is like my 3rd time meeting her. She is aware I have PTSD. I struggle with communication and have had to print out a typed out paper to try to explain for me because I’m too afraid to verbally say it. If I have to verbalize this I don’t know how I would even begin. She once mentioned something about willing to work with me on the needle phobia but she doesn’t know about a lot of my other phobias and triggers like being touched.. I’m so grateful she wants to work on the needles and promised me she would be patient and understanding, and I know she’s telling the truth. but I have so much constant anxiety all of the time. I feel like I just have so many problems and I keep being paranoid and worried my doctor will be mad at me and drop me as a patient, or might just be constantly disappointed that I’m so reluctant to nearly everything. Every single time I’ve seen her (like 3 times) I’ve been busting into tears just from being there. Doctor offices just trigger so much fear for me. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?

More recently, I remember a couple of protests that turned unpeaceful in which police started raining teargas on us, like dozens of cans, I vividly remember it raining from the night sky, and then there was a lot of crowd movement that we eventually managed, then we were charged by police and had to run, and they would harass us for about 30 minutes by following us into narrower and narrower streets, I thought they would never stop, and find us eventually. I can't remember the details, how many people were there, how close we were to getting arrested, I simply remember that I thought that I would get beaten up, or arrested, and that, in a way or another, I would spend the night at the station, and that I would be all alone. And I think that these events affected me heavily.\n\nI don't handle stress very well and I might be exaggerating the consequences but this is how I perceived it would go. This happened a few months ago, and I've noticed that (from more serious events) I need a few months to process stressful things that happened to me, and I think I recently processed these.\n\nThere was also an event that stressed me so much that I couldn't sleep the night before, and the night after, I think about it every day or two, I've talked about it to people that participated in it but they never felt the same. Since then, I have become paranoid about what I say about it and to whom, and I'm too afraid to disclose here what I think could happen to me.\n\nRecently, I'm very easily startled by sound/light/movement, I am in a state of near-constant alert, I am emotionally numb, I have trouble sleeping, I often make nightmares about being chased down (though this happened a lot too before these specific events), I dissociate a lot and visualize scenarios (that are getting increasingly realistic) where I am chased down, being in a somewhat crowded environnement makes me wanna scream and run everywhere and throw up. And the sight of a police team or car is enough to make me go into a state in which I am super-aware of everything that is happening around me, and I am extremely stressed and my heart is beating super fast, as if in a few seconds I would be surrounded and there would be teargas everywhere again.\n\nI was quite reluctant to writing this for obvious legal reasons but I can't think of anything else. I cannot get in touch with political activism in any away anymore. I am so numb to everything that is happening around me that all I want to do is to get into stressful political actions again, I don't know what to do.",

        "Text": "My abuser sent me this. I don't know how to take it, it's been about a decade since. For reason I have changed a name and a couple words, R is my older brother.\n\nHey, it's me. You blocked me and I didn't know how to reach you. Look I can never be forgiven for what I did. But I wasn't right in the mind, I'll explain in a bit. I don't expect any forgiveness or anything nor am I excusing anything I did, but please let me explain how it happened. Trust me I've never forgotten either, I've remembered both what happened to me and you. I have been actively punishing myself because I believe that I don't deserve happiness. I have avoided having any type of relationships and starting a family because I truly believe I don't deserve it. I've been doing my best to help other and trying to be as kind as I can. I'm sure none of that matters to you as it really doesn't affect you, but please know I have been trying to be a better person to others rather than myself. I have even attempted suicide although I couldn't commit to it. Again I don't expect forgiveness or anything, I'm not going to excuse myself either, I did what I did and I cannot change that. But please hear my experience as it might give reason to it, again not an excuse. \n\nIt started when I was 4 or 5, a family member of ours (nobody immediate, think cousin or something) showed me porn for the first time, and made me masturbate with them. This happened multiple time. Around age 6, R started to sa me. I didn't know if it was right or wrong, I saw what happened in the pornos and saw they felt good and thought it was a good thing too. This happened for many years. Before it stopped, I remember I was at your house, it was night time, and I was going to go into the kitchen to get water, but I saw the TV on. I saw you and your dad on the couch and he was watching porn on the TV with you next to him, I don't remember the ages but you weren't a baby but still small. \n\nThe last time R did anything was when your parents were going to the store with you and your sister, and asked if I wanted to stay or go. I said stay. This was the last time with R. From there I was about 8 or 9 or something, I missed the feeling that occurred when R used to do what he did. It wasn't until we were at my house with our cousins, it was 4 or 5 of us and you were trying to kiss everyone on the lips, I am now starting to think this is due to what you were forced to watch as a kid on TV, as you were probably just doing what you saw. \n\nThat's when it started, I didn't know if it was something wrong or right, I just thought it was suppose to be a secret, since that's what I thought with R. I wish I would have never done that, I wish I would have stopped before anything happened, I cannot change the past unfortunately, no matter how much I wish I could. As I got older I start to understand it wasn't right to do that, again I'm sorry I took too long to realize. I should have apologize sooner, I didn't know how I could though, I knew you hated me, I knew I fucked up, I knew I hated myself, because I hated what R did to me too, but I realized all that too late. I could have apologized sooner, but I didn't know how to, I still don't, and I doubt I can do anything to change your opinion of me, and I understand that too because that's how I feel about R. \nI don't think I'll ever be able to live without the memories of the events that happened to me since i was 4. I have tried to forget them, all of them, but I cannot as I'm sure you can't either.\n\nLook there is nothing I can do to take back anything from the past, I will continue to live with both the shame and guilt I have, I will continue to punish myself by not allowing myself to be happy. Trust me nobody hates me more than I hate myself. I understand if you still want to hurt me, hell I want to hurt R, but I won't because it won't help me in anyway, I have been trying to live despite it happening, i don't forgive him nor will i forget it, but i will do my best to continue living and helping people whenever i can because of it. I'm sorry I put you through that, you didn't deserve it, I wish I could have broke the cycle, but I couldn't. I hope you did. I hope you can continue living your life and become who you want to be. I hope you can start a family and be proud of them. I'm sorry for all the harm I have caused you, I wished I could understand what I was doing when I was younger and prevent myself from doing so. If you still feel you need to do what you said in your message I understand. This will be too much to ask for but if you could, just let me know before hand, if im going, I'd like to ask R why he did what he did to me. If not I understand. Again I cannot apologize enough, you deserved better. I'm sorry, I will forever be sorry. ",

        "Text": "I really don’t know how to express this, it’s affecting me a lot but at the same time I think I do deserve it. I got a friend request on Discord in June of this year and I was curious so I accepted it. To be honest I thought it was going to be a ghost friend (those ones you talk to once and then they disappear) but we really got along and became really good friends. In one of our calls he told me he was 15 and turning 16 but I didn’t pay much attention to him because I was not focused on spending my time in a relationship, I have to go to college and I have to be cencetrated on that. The thing is he started being really affectionate with me, at that time I was 18 years and 6 months old. I never took him seriously because I knew it was wrong but one day I fell into his game and started flirting too, I don’t blame him for starting it, he’s a teenager who is discovering himself but I’m not supposed to be that for him, I’m 2 years older. I’ve also been through his age and I know how dumb you can be. And even knowing all this I screwed up, I told my psychologist and she told me that luckily it didn’t go that far, in her words it sounded like a child’s play because it was basically descriptions of displays of affection, but to me it’s something that will follow me for years. After that, I told him that I was not going to do that again, I felt terribly disgusted by my actions. Somehow at that moment I forgot that it was him, I forgot that he was just a teenager and I’m already 18, technically I’m an adult and I should have acted like one and stopped everything before it happened, not after. This wasn’t what I wanted. We kept talking but now he was really insisting on being something with me, I started to feel very uncomfortable especially after what I did, I asked my psychologist for help, I didn’t know what to do, and she told me to take some space and stop talking to him. So that's what I did, I told him that we should stop talking for a while, because I knew the feelings he had for me, and we stopped texting, but that only lasted a month because he talked to me again and I couldn't just leave it there because I felt guilty. I think it's my fault that I made him seek me out again. At least he understood the point of not flirting anymore and just being normal friends. Which on the one hand I was grateful for, but on the inside I wish I could never talk to him again, I still feel guilty, so every time he texted me I felt obligated to reply and I don't want this anymore, I can't handle this, he's a good person, but I feel so disgusted with myself every time I talk to him. \"I think I can do this, these are the consequences of my actions\" I told myself, but yesterday he accidentally said that he didn't turn 16 BUT 15. This was really my breaking point, meaning that on that occasion he was 14, I literally threw up. I’ve been thinking about this all day and I came to the conclusion that I can’t with this anymore, I tried to end it all but it didn’t work. I was so desperate but a friend whom I really thank very much for existing show up and I finally told someone other than my psychologist about this. This friend calmed me down and told me that writing this here right now could help me to find some solutions. I don’t think it’s good for me to keep talking with him (the teenager) but at the same time I think it’s an obligation because we’re supposed to be on good terms and he knows my social media and I don’t want to be on bad terms with him because he could show my mistake and I wouldn’t be able to be live with that, even if it’s not as bad as other cases, this just makes me want to restart everything.\n\nAdditional info:\n\nI don't know if the fact that I can't imagine someone I met on Discord as a real person comes from last year, when I sold myself as a Discord kitten. I blocked my mind from thinking about who was behind the monitor for my own good. Of course this is not an excuse but I was curious if this happens to other people even if they haven't been specifically in my situation.",

So admittedly, I have consistent work to do when it comes to temperament and gentleness when I am triggered/in pain. That being said, when I am activated/triggered, my partner usually tends toward defensiveness, which has gotten easier to work with but remains an extremely difficult reaction to carry in that state.

I can’t help but feel so fucking guilty…. Guilty for trusting her, telling her my feelings, and then feeling like I was finally part of another family…. Am I safe to grieve someone who is dying of cancer but she betrayed me?? Am I allowed??? I have panic attacks for back when I heard her in the voicemails now and I lost my uncle to leukemia years ago but never really processed it because I was caring for my soon-to-be three year old daughter….. And hearing the news now that my daughter’s grandma is dying feels like I’m going through it again….",

It took a whole HOUR for the police to show up. I called 911 and told them about the man walking around my house banging on my windows and trying to open my door and how I was home alone with my baby. \nRight after they arrested him, I suddenly got a headache that hasn't gone away (5 hours later). I'm still super on edge and can't calm down. \nThis scenario has played in my head ONCE and i never thought it would happen. but it did and now im scared and traumatized of being home alone at any time with my baby. \nI went out about 2 hours ago to the store alone (left baby with my mom) and saw 3 more crackheads yelling at cars and being weird. It made me even more anxious. \nI don't live in a bad area. I live in what's supposedly the \"Mini Beverly Hills\" and have always felt safe here. But recently I don't even feel safe walking in daylight to the park. ",

I've been in PTSD treatment for a while, and also disassociation separately, but it hasn't seemed to help me very much. One seems to make the other one go up when you fix the one of them, like they're on opposite sides of the spectrum. I've recently been reading about PTSD-DS which I think may fit my issues more, because rather than two separate issues, it's a combined issue that disassociation is actually part of a subset of PTSD. I was wondering if anyone knows any good online psychologists that treat this specific type of PTSD?",

I tried to blame others around me and took advantage of people, including my husband and child. The truth is, I haven't been good to anyone in my life. Even though my parents are over 75 years old, I didn’t care about how they were doing. I was stuck in a cycle of blaming others, unable to move past the mentality of a child.\n\nToday, I finally realized and accepted that I have been an offender, not a victim. I made many mistakes in the past, and I apologize to everyone I hurt, including my mom. Admitting this doesn’t feel good, but it’s a necessary step. I can now move on from the victim mentality and accept that I am not a victim — I am responsible for my actions.\n\nIt took me a year of therapy, meditation, and using substances like weed and mushrooms, but I finally feel like I’m over it.

It was really abrupt and also really upsetting to see him that unwell and that I was unknowingly a burden to him. We’ve talked it out, I’ve been given all the answers I need, he broke up with me in the kindest most compassionate way, but regardless i am still extremely disregulated and struggling and given me a big ptsd flare up for weeks now, with little signs of improvement. I’ve done all the healthy things - reach out to others, exercise, eat well, go outside, distract yourself, attempt to convince myself I deserve better, get on waiting lists for therapy, go no contact, get support from charities, try to be my own boyfriend. But I still end up feeling chronically unsafe and scared, I’m in my final year of uni and im getting into dangerous territory with my fine art degree reaching nearly a month being away (every time I go in, I have a flare up/flashback to when I was a child, or when I make work, I think it subconsciously triggers things) and I recieved a diagnosis for ptsd yesterday.\nTo know the most important person in you life has chosen to live it without you, to be not as terrified of loosing you as you were about them, is a really difficult feeling with my past of abandonment I experienced as a child after facing SA. I would be really greatful if anyone who struggles with a similar thing in ptsd what they do to manage feelings of abandonment and self regulate. Thanks so much ",

        "Text": "Tw; gun violence \n\nA little over a month ago, | (28F) was walking my dog behind my house, a neighborhood where l've lived for years without ever feeling unsafe. Suddenly, a man wearing a ski mask holding a gun appeared from around the corner, pointing it at my face and demanded I hand over my dog. (Honey a 3 year old French Bulldog)\nSomething took over me and I instantly refused and used my body to protect her. He pulled the trigger right at my face, but nothing happened. He seemed surprised and tried again but it still didn’t go off. Then he lunged and started hitting me in the head with the gun, telling me to stop screaming and trying to rip her away her from me. I kept screaming, and eventually, he fled. Honey and I were able to run in to a neighbor's house for safety.\n\nFor the first four weeks, I was in shock, unable to fully process what actually happened. I started therapy, and things felt ok enough that I was eager to jump back into work. Im absolutely terrified to walk my dogs or leave my house with them now but that didn’t come to much of a surprise given what happened. \n\nBut the past week I’ve become irritable and deeply resentful toward people close to me who haven't reached out or shown any support. So many friends and people from our local frenchie meet up group have acted as if this never happened and tbh really don’t seem to care at all. I’ve only getting 3 -4 hours of sleep a night this week and during the day at work I felt nauseous and had body aches.  But I assumed I was just getting sick or something. On my day off today, I felt completely fine! however, as soon as was in bed and thought about having to put on a face and be away from honey at work tomorrow.. instantly all my symptoms, especially the nausea, hit me like a train and I started to have flash backs which lead to a panic attack. I definitely see now that this is PTSD.\n\nI'm wondering if the resentment I feel toward people who haven't shown any support will eventually go away or if it's something I'll carry forever? I don't necessarily want to hold on to it, but thinking that l could have died and people close to me and honey don't seem to care makes me feel a level of hurt I can’t even describe and tbh I don’t know if I even want people like that in my life. \n\nI work two jobs, but my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive, encouraging me to slow down and focus on healing while he takes care of bills etc. I’m considering quitting one of my jobs, but I’ve only been there for three months, and as a chronic people-pleaser, I feel extremely guilty about leaving. I’m also struggling with how to even explain my decision since I’ve appeared perfectly fine since my attack. 😔",

I thought you wanted to work on this paper we have to write.\" He stopped for a little bit, then asked me if I was a virgin. I didn't answer so he started talking about how he wants to be someone's first and to take a girl's virginity. Something about the way he said it really triggered me and I think he saw the look on my face because he asked if I regret my first time. I just started crying and told him that it was forced on me, that I didn't have a choice, that I kept saying no, that the man who took my virginity was older, bigger, and stronger than me\n\nAs embarrassing as my breakdown was, I hoped it would be enough to get him to stop asking questions and just write the damn paper.

Anyway, my new therapist told me she doubts I have ptsd as that what you get from going to war. She said she’s worked with people with ptsd for 15years and she doesn’t think I fit it. Do I continue with her or cut her off? She seemed really nice otherwise, and I didn’t help myself by telling her everything, but then I don’t have clear memories of the CSA, just very strong feelings and what others have told me about my behaviour as a child and little things I can remember that could point to it, I really don’t know, is she right, could I not have ptsd? Just a lot of trauma?",

I do know the age gap is horrible, and I regret it, not here to justify. However, I feel like having sex with him has been in my flashbacks?? Nothing traumatic happened, and it was 100% consensual, I know now it was creepy, but the sex is something I said yes to. The flashbacks started a couple weeks after and not during, and all I'm seeing is you get triggered WHILE have consenting sex not weeks after. I honestly feel disgusting and horrible and am just really confused and want advice or to know other people have gone through something similar because I feel alone and ashamed. My therapist and I are doing EDMR therapy next session to help with the sexual traumas.\n\n\nEdit: I am getting flashbacks with the actual S/A and robbing as well.

But that wasn't what broke me. I broke up with him and he contacted all my friends to send them nudes of me. He blackmailed me to my employer and I got dismissed without further notice. He blackmailed me to my government. His claims: I'm a prostitute. I'm on drugs. I publish porn. I publish child pornography of my own child, I put my child on drugs. He put some videos of my child on pornhub that he took when my child was roaming around in a diaper on a sunny day. This is all really horrible per se. He nuked my whole social circle. But I was like fuck it and started a new life. I started dating my partner. Our anniversary is in 5 days. Right now he is working a lot and it throws me back to when he was working a lot in February but he was so shitty. He just came to eat what I cooked,To put dirty dishes in the sink. He also was using my computer cos his one was broken at the time so I was really isolated too. Whenever he had free time he went out with his uni friends (without me). In April I found out he said ily to all his female friends (and the girls he went out drinking with all the time). I have massive cptsd. Partly from what I went through in my previous relationship but the fact that he kicked me while I was on the ground amplifies my cptsd and just throws it completely out of dimension. Next month it will be a year ago that he treated me like shit, too. I was on a vacation with my mom shortly after we started dating and he ghosted me, partied the whole time, slept over at friends, battery on 1%. Later I went through his phone that he was texting everyone (including random girls like one for days 247 even) but me and he even gave his ex a birthday present for her bday last December. This I only found out in may. This year my birthday comes around and he's too broke toCome up with a gift on time. It was in September. Every time my cptsd is triggered I shut him out. And he has no EQ to know how to deal with it and everything just gets worse like right now.He has a lot of work right now and even tho he isn't acting like he used to but I keep having intrusive thoughts, spiralling thoughts like all the bad events accumulating in an endless loop and I know it's my trauma. He has no clue what is going on with me but I'm so on fire I literally wanna pack my bags and just leave the country with my son. Our anniversary is in 5 days and all I can think is I can't do another year like this. December will come and I will be so depressed about the anniversary of memories. And I shut him out I won't even talk to him because I don't feel safe to trust him with the pain I have because of what he did to me after my previous relationship. He witnessed it all. He was my friend during that time and the fact that he did that after I was so maliciously abused is hurting me more than the actual abuse. I don't wanna play victim here. I know I'm dysfunctional and have been. As I said I'm on fire idk how to snap out of it",

The psychologist is adamant I can’t have adhd because it is developmental and that I have ptsd caused by my husband.  Not earth shattering considering he had extreme reactions including punching holes in our house walls and leaving erratically saying he was going to commit suicide, leaving me with a small 2 year old crying.\n\nI left this summer when his aggressive behavior made my kids cry and scared, not to mention my nervous system.  He would not let me leave or go without constant communication.  He swore he would change, found quite literally 4 therapists he was seeing all at the same time.  I asked him to leave so we could come home, he agreed, then did not leave.  \n\nNow it’s back to the old ways.  His presence triggers me so I try to peacefully avoid him and protect myself.  This morning he came home(I never know when to expect this so I gave my earplugs handy), said “hi”, I said “hi”, and he said “I said HI”.  I said I said hi and removed myself to another room.  He came in and said we have some administrative things to take care of.  I say ok, he tells me, I say ok.  He goes upstairs and texts me “I have a few things to get off my chest.  We need to talk later”.  This elevates me and I tell him it is unfair that he does that especially first thing in the morning.  \n\nI finally just go upstairs to ask him what he needs to get off his chest, extremely elevated at this point.  And he won’t tell me,  we need to schedule a time to talk later.  I continue to ask him to please just tell me the bullet points.  He refuses and continues to lecture me about how all of this is harder for him because he has an anxious attachment.  He regularly has “meetings” with me where he is the only one who talks.  Look, I know he has zero care for me, it’s all about control.  Shortly later he slammed a door very loudly to the point both my kids said they were scared.  \n\nHow can I survive in this environment while making a plan to leave?  My nervous system is shot, but resisting him makes everything so much worse.  I hate him in the depths of my soul.  Please be gentle.\n\n",

My whole sexual behavior revolves around this.\n\nMy question is: i need an explanation why do i keep re experiencing the sexual abuse and turn it into a pleasurable experience, i fking hate this, i want it to stop.\nAnd how can i stop it from progressing and effecting my sexual behavior. It’s becoming self destructive.  ",

        "Text": "Apologies its a bit long. I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. \n\nSo I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didn't work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldn't help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. \n\nI obviously didn't want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions = less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. \n\nIt started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could (IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl) but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there (lying on a hospital bed) every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die.\n\nThey discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. \n\nI was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didn't have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.\n\nEventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like I'm right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. \n\nThe worst part is I don't feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks. Anything have any advice on how to deal with this or any tips on how to manage when I have the flashbacks? Any help appreciated. ",

My mother has borderline personality disorder and father exhibits all narcissistic personality disorder traits but does not have an official diagnosis. I personally have ADHD, PMDD, GA, and some C-PTSD. I often get extremely triggered by my parents and have a hard time calming my emotions and urges. \n\nRecently (like within the past few years) I’ve started realizing how much my parents manipulate and use me in their wars against each other or for their favor. Safe to say I’ve started resenting them heavily for it as my reliance on them has decreased. I’ve started fighting back a lot.\n\nA terrifying urge I’ve developed when frustrated is to bite them. Like sink my teeth into them to get them to shut up? I’ve never done it and don’t plan to but when I start seeing red it becomes really hard to control. It’s kind of insane and I’m terrified and grossed out by this but genuinely thinking it’s a trauma response.\n\nBut I’m afraid I’m wrong and it might be a precursor to abuse or my propensity to want to abuse others if I get angry at them but don’t know if this is just standard reactionary abuse behavior. \n\nI also worry (as insane as it sounds) that it might have something to do with cannibalism? I’ve always liked biting people I love gently but sometimes it’s gotten a little intense but never to the point where I’ve hurt them. \n\nI’m afraid my therapist might put me in an institute or something but know I need to tell her eventually but in the meantime what the hell am I supposed to do? Any good articles or research? \n",

They don't call me back for TWO weeks so after my 3rd session (I did go back. It was awful) and again I miss the call. They leave a message saying they are only calling back now because they know I have been busy with the ketamine sessions and that they are available to schedule an appointment the following week to resume our sessions and talk about how the ketamine treatments went.\n\nI've had a couple of sessions with T since and I can't let go of how they basically ignored me when I was in need of help.  I can completely understand if they didn't have time for a session when I reached out, but the least they could have done was call me back when I'm in obvious distress for even a minute.

        "Text": "  I’m not judging anyone who is having casual sex, but clearly it’s not my thing because I tried to do it and I’m really bad at not getting feelings. Maybe because I’m a virgin idk….. I ended up thinking like if I do something sexual with a couple guys I will just be healed. My trauma won’t matter anymore. It sort of helped cuz I have had different experiences, but I still haven’t had any experiences you know positively with anything close to ummm my trauma …..\n\n  So now I’m a 26 year old virgin who is also damaged and just fml. It didn’t help that this guy pretty much said I “should be with someone n deserve someone who can handle my PTSD “.  And it’s fine like I realize I’m a mess right now he’s right. I’m not ready for a relationship…… but I think that just made me feel worse because I was lying to him lying to myself. I did things I now regret like whatever it’s fine I liked him, but I just feel used . He said from the beginning he wanted causal but then he knew about my SA trauma . He knew n he I guess assumed it’d be okay cuz I’m “slutty”. Then I guess later felt bad about it. Whatever.\n\n    Anyway, I can’t seem to see sexual normally so I don’t think “hooking up” especially casually is a very good idea. Like I have triggers and literally any mention of sex I just think of my SA. It’s the only reference I have unfortunately…..\n\n  It helped a bit like I said but it definitely didn’t like get rid of the pain I’m feeling. It just made it worse because now I just did these things to make myself like feel anything else and to lower the value of what was stolen from me….\n\n  He didn’t exactly take my virginity . He “just” SA me over my clothes, so I feel dramatic being this upset about it, but the way I see it that was my first experience. No he didn’t take that he didn’t have actual like PIV sex with me, but my first experience was literally assault and traumatizing. \n\n  I’m just not okay right now. And I’m realizing I became like attached to my rapist after I even kept dating him, because idk I thought it was my fault for not being ready. For not meeting his needs…. \n\n  Help. I feel so crazy like why is this so traumatizing ? Will I ever feel better and heal from this ? \n\n  I feel guilty too even wanting a normal sex life after that even wanting something that was so traumatic for me that was so disgustingly like…. forced so now I feel guilty that I’m even curious to know what normal sex is like.\n\n  I’m just so depressed. How do I heal from this? And please don’t tell me to get therapy . I can’t get therapy yet. \n\n  And what he did wasn’t even rape ! It wasn’t even forcing actual sex. He just did it aggressively but over my clothes so why am I so traumatized ? I know being raped must be like horrible and way different, but I’m so upset still. ",

        "Text": "    My Story \n\n  This guy I had only been on a couple dates with….  This was the third date, but we had talked on the phone that’s it though 3 months. I told him I never did anything sexually I’m a virgin basically a “good girl” for lack of better words.  And I was raised like that sex should be if I’m in love or preferably I should be married. At least I should know the guy really well. Besides that I wasn’t comfortable with sex. I wasn’t taught much about it. I was taught it was bad pretty much and I didn’t know it was even normal for women to have urges ? So you get how I felt about it mentally emotionally. Though I did think from the beginning wow I feel like eventually I will have to because he was pressuring me, but too subtly for me to think much of it….. but whenever he brought it up I got uncomfortable (like our second date and he said I’d never pressure you or anything and you wouldn’t do it out of guilt right? Then he just said hey I really like you…. Anyway I only knew him in person for three days before he sexually assaulted me. It was our first day literally first day of dating. \n\n    So here’s what happened…… we were in his car as he pulled into the driveway to his house. I kept saying I’m looking for somewhere to go and he just ignored me. He suggested we go back inside his house and “hang out”. Stupidly I believed him. He also casually says “oh hey my Uncles here”. \n\n    I don’t go inside at first but eventually I do and thinking we’re gonna hang out. So at first we were just kissing ……. but then he started I guess grinding on me ? I didn’t know what it was even called at the time or I might’ve just left, but I didn’t think much of it at the time and he seemed nice enough. And I got really nervous. I said I had to go to the bathroom then went back like nah he doesn’t realize so I just have to tell him. So I tell him I’m really nervous I need to breathe. I do want to kiss you though.\n\n  So he goes back to kissing me but how he’s doing it is more…. Intense so I have a panic attack . Eventually he pulled away and just went and sat on the other side of his bed ignoring me.\n\n   He just completely ignored me he wouldn’t even look at me. I kept trying to tell him I was nervous again like I said. He sighs really loudly and like an idiot I ask what ? What’s wrong ? Then he doesn’t say anything again and just sighs irritated. Nervously I ask “what ? What do you want ? He then gets in my face and says I WANT you……. (Empasizing the want) Then whispers to stop in MY EAR and goes back to kissing me even though I wasn’t and gets ontop of me again trying to kiss my neck.\n\n  His Uncle walks in and asks if I’m okay because we’re kissing but he’s touching me groping me actually grabbing my boobs my ass and I’m literally doing nothing back but kissing him. I’m embarrassed and my face is getting red cuz I feel embarrassed about that so I say I’m okay and then he leaves and talks to his uncle……\n\n  Then he comes back and says “Now….. where were we ?” And I don’t like how he says it but I feel insecure and I keep thinking maybe I should just touch him back like he wants even though it’s because he said he wanted me to stop sarcastically and even threateningly so at first I do. \n\n  Then he tries grinding on me again and I completely pull away and stop kissing him I stop like everything. I’m just looking down at what he tried to do again and I’m in shock. I wanted to say something but the way he said “ stop “ was so aggressive and it made me feel guilty and afraid, but again I just kept telling myself it’s fine I’m overthinking it he’s nice. \n\n  Then he looks down also looks at me sighs and then grabs me and kisses me I don’t know what to do. I don’t really think I need to scream and I’m getting afraid cuz I’m not grabbing him back, but either way he’s kissing me so aggressively not moving away from my face that I do back just because he’s freaking me out and I don’t want to offend him. So I think maybe if I don’t put my hands on him. So I don’t . The weird thing is idk maybe I’m overthinking it but he had grabbed and just kissed me before too and in his room, so why would I think the situation would get dangerous? \n\n  Then he just gets on my legs with his knees and I can’t move. We still have our clothes on. He just literally sits on my legs with his knees and I can’t move. I think does he realize he’s crushing my legs. I wanna scream but I just freeze. I can’t move.  I don’t care what anyone says idk how to describe it but simulating “rough sex” except I didn’t consent so it simulated something different almost for me that seems more accurate than saying it was dry humping because that’s when two people are doing it. This was not that. To me it was just violating and abuse. I mean I couldn’t move I didn’t move once. \n\n  At all. \n\n    Then he proceeds to aggressively hump me until he finishes…… all while I can not move (tonic immobility) like freezing in fear cuz of him getting on my legs and I dissacociated…… but it was HOW he did it he seemed mad at me and he was aggressive. And it was kind of roughly……. how he did it though thankfully wasn’t injured not to that point. He made me feel his groin area….. many times…. Through the clothing. He forced my body to react then just finished……. But after a long ass time n mind you I was HELD DOWN during this. He even TOOK BREAKS. And he kept getting ontop of me while he did this. It was terrifying I tried like if I just look away never look at him maybe he’ll stop. He didn’t.  Even though it was aggressive dry humping I mean I was dissacociated and I froze and it sounded wrong so to be completely honest to ME from MY perspective at first I thought “ oh god it sounds like I’m being raped” and it did because he was roughly doing it without my consent and it didn’t sound right. It literally sounded forced, but my mind just went somewhere else though I partly had awareness of what was going on. And it took time to even figure out what was going on because I had never done anything at all sexually, so I was really scared. Emotionally though I just felt dead inside: empty. I felt like a fucking toy and he was using my body to…… you know. And I was just there frozen unable to move. :( \n\n  I know he didn’t rape me or anything n I’m grateful it was at least over our clothes but here’s the thing : I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I HAD NO SEXUAL EXPERIENCE  and I’M A VIRGIN so to me it was horrifyingly close to something else or am I being dramatic ? I know it’s not even actual sex. I’m traumatized though. It still gave me PTSD.  And some fucking weird kinks and affected my sexuality amongst other issues….. .-.\n\n  I should mention honestly I wasn’t ready at all. I could see myself having been ready like 20’s like early 20’s . I was 19 at the time. It really hurts this being my first experience. Plus it makes dating just a nightmare. Especially being a bit promiscuous after this for a while just to make myself feel better like the more experienced I am, the less this matters. That isn’t helping though so now I just probably need therapy first before I do anything related cuz it just reminds me of my assault…..",

Its on the paper now, It doesn't feel real honestly, it's like if someone came up to the child in me and told me they believed me about my abuse, that I shouldn't have gone through it, that Im okay now, what a weird feeling.\n\nI know there will be parts of PTSD that I can't change and that I'm on a high right now and there will be low parts in the future, a lot of fear is still there, but its kinda of like I blame myself less? It feels more manageable with less self hatred. I can progress because everything isn't just in my head, it was real, and now I have a choice to live on. Hope? Maybe, more \"Contentness\".",

        "Text": "Hi I just wanted advice as I have no one to talk about this with. I’m 24(M) I have OCD and assume I have some PTSD. When I was maybe between 6-8, I remember my older cousin doing sexual things with me and my other cousin who was a year younger than me. She is 6 years older than me so a teenager at the time and she would dry hump with us when we were alone. I always was aware of this happening(I might’ve forgot years after it happened) and I sort of just ignored it or maybe tried to cope with it by thinkin it was just a really weird thing that happened but I guess I’m my head somewhat consensual. This was my earliest memory of knowing what sex was. This ended up with me growing up with a rather bad relationship with sex not to mention I’ve had OCD since a child and only recently found out. Sexual OCD is probably the hardest ocd type for me to deal with. I just don’t know what to feel. I actually got close with her as an adult but I just feel super weird now bein a lot more conscious about this. My biggest struggle in life is OCD so most of my trauma feels tied to that but I never really considered how much of an impact this had on me cuz I just didn’t want to think abt it. I think another bad part abt this is the fact that me and my cousin who i mentioned before did actually end up doin inappropriate things wit each other and actually got caught kissing once, the most awful part I hate is the fact that after this there was a time with my other younger cousin where I pulled their pants down and told my uncle and I got screamed at of course rightfully so, pulling their pants down was all that happened and I always get scared thinkin abt what if things would’ve gone further. It’s so gross and I’ve honestly lived with so much guilt from this. Im positive my family doesn’t even know that my older cousin was the one that introduced these behaviors to me and my younger cousin. Just feel uneasy abt this don’t even feel super scared cuz I worked thru so much of my anxiety living with OCD but I just feel super queasy and numb right now.",

        "Text": "My parents were fucking crazy. My mom used to put weed or meth in a cigarette carton, then would send me as her little messenger (even in snow storms) to these 2 scary people in my neighborhood. \n\nHer best friend was a drug dealer. His daughter was my age, and they forced us to be friends from kindergarten on. My mom never listened to me and made me go with him for carpooling. I would get sick and puke in his car because the smell was so bad and I would be so scared that it came out physically. At their house, it was in middle of no where in the woods, so big, an intercom and cameras everywhere, he apparently worked at a tile business but was NEVER at work, he always had robberies, family members would randomly die, scary people would show up at their house coming and going all day, he would drive us to random towns for meals to meet people. He was arrested by the time we were seniors in high school. He wrote my mom, and he was released right before I went NC. She picked me up at train station, and started taking me to his house. She was laughing as I cried and begged not to take me near him. \n\nThen that last xmas with my mom, my 3 brothers ditched me and went to our other side of the family party so I was stuck with her. She drove me to an abandoned apartment complex, took me in an abandoned apartment trap house with 2 creepy guys, and started snorting stuff in front of me while they asked if I wanted any. WHAT. \n\nI just dont get why these people would put me in harms way so much. Even my grandfather was a creep, like would put his arm around my moms waist and stuff and touch her. A classic narc, very wealthy and powerful. He used to tickle my 3 brothers, and they HATED IT. They would beg my dad not to let my grandfather do that to them, but my dad was too intimidated by him to protect my brothers.\n\nSo, the last time I saw my mom she dropped me off at train station. 7 min away. She told my brothers laughing, and told me to scare me that shes taking me 1 hour away to a dangerous area of the city to figure it out with the \"bad guys.\" Just to see me scared. Its sick. They are sadistic fucks.\n\nAnd they still act like victims as to why i went NC lol",

The relationship was over and needed to be. I thought talking to a counselor would help. It has but not for what I think is PTSD. My counselor also thinks it is. Should I ask my counselor to refer me to a specialist in the PTSD field? Or is this \"just trauma\"? The woman I was with definitely had a lot more trauma, horrible trauma in her past. She may have PTSD but thinks she is fine not relevant, just a side note\n\nI started walking, I have completely lost interest in myself, I was doing so good on a weight loss program until about a week ago. I started this in July before the two main incidents. There has what I have termed \"branches\" to my condition as well. Other incidents that may have been building a \"foundation\"\n\nMy main symptoms are these: #1 I can't be around other couples fighting or arguing, it triggers me and even if a hint a disagreement is coming, I immediately leave 2. A weird brain fog that happens 5-6x a day at work when I'm in front of a patient and I sit there for a min almost frozen. 3. I lose my train of thought quickly now. 4. I sweat the bed a few times a week. 5. Nightmares about guns/murder/suicides. 6. Substance abuse increased. I wasn't a drinker before but now I'm hitting the bars alot more. 7. I lash out so quick now at people \n\nIt's been about 2 months, is this a normal time frame to start having these issues? Is there even a time frame?.

And I trusted him so I let it go. And then they got bigger and he got meaner. Eventually I was convinced nobody would ever want me so I stayed. Once we ended, he was so mean and just tore me apart. Paragraphs about how I was ugly, nobody would ever love me, he never loved me, ect. It got so bad that my parents were going to put a restraining order on him.\n\nIt’s been about a year and a half and im still not the same. I am trying to get myself back but it feels kind of impossible.\n\nI miss not feeling like a nuisance to everyone around me, I miss being able to talk things out with people without fear of them being mad, I miss liking myself and how I looked. I am so tired of this ruining my relationships with friends and potential relationships with guys as well. (Just fucked up a talking stage with this guy I REALLY liked because I was scared to talk things out). I miss the passion that I used to have for things. I used to be so passionate about my writing and crocheting and my style and the people around me and now im just kind of here. I was so so special. Just a ray of sunshine and laughter and I made everyone around me feel so happy and special.\n\nAnd now im such a shell of myself. I still like crocheting and dressing up and everything but i am not as passionate about it. I am no longer kind. I am so mean to people for no reason. I am in therapy, on medication, I go for walks, I journal, but it feels like I’ll just never be me again. I have goals. I work towards them and I am trying to better myself because yes, he did fuck me up but it’s my choice to either stay that way or get better. And I know I can get out of my depression but I don’t know if I’ll ever be ME again. \n\nIm not mad at him anymore. It’s not productive. And i understand him. I understand why he does those things. I understand why he’s so mean. I just wish I got away sooner. I wish this wasn’t my first relationship. \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to forget and move on but I just can’t. I can’t move on when I deal with the effects of this every day of my life.\n\nAnd the worst part is that people don’t believe me. He gets away with it. He’s on the news for some bullshit he pretends to care about and everyone’s like “omg he’s so brave for speaking up” and in reality he’s just pretending he cares about people. 2 of my friends still talk to him.\n\nI just want to be myself again. Be honest, will i ever be me again? Because I don’t think so. I just miss myself.",

        "Text": "I was sexually assaulted by a woman a few weeks ago.\n\nWe had casually hooked up a few times, not really knowing each other in a sober context, mostly just meeting up at college parties and making out, etc. One day she encouraged me to get high and then asked to go back to my room place. When we did she raped me.\n\nI was so high that I barely knew what was happening. I had initially consented to kissing and above the waist stuff. But she quickly grew more aggressive and it progressed to more- both her touching me between the legs and using my hand to pleasure herself. I’ve been sexually assaulted before (by a man) so I just froze, I couldn’t move. When I finally came to my senses I tried to push her off of me and told her that I needed a break/to text my roommate/find my phone. I kept repeating myself but she refused to stop. \n\nI finally pushed myself up and tried to get out from under her, but she pinned her legs around me and forced me back down. I told her no, but she didn’t listen and kept going. The next day my arm was sprained from being held down with it pinned behind my back. I also had visible hickeys on my neck, which made it even more triggering.\n\nWhen I finally got her out of my room after physically forcing her off of me (she kept saying ten more minutes and continuing to make out with and touch me despite my protests. I had eventually just surrendered and lay passively while she did what she wanted) I felt nothing.\n\nI washed my face and immediately went to bed, feeling uncomfortable, used, and terrified. I didn’t know what had happened, or if that was normal for sex. I’ve never had sex with a woman before so I didn’t know.\n\nThe worst part is I continued to see this girl for over a month before finally cutting things off yesterday. After this incident I’d still go out with her, even though she regularly ghosted me on planned dates, blew me off, and objectified me in front of other people, treating me like arm candy and talking about me in overly sexual ways in front of people I barely knew. She also always found ways to turn our planned sober “dates” into affairs where both of us were drunk and/or high, and when this happened she was always aggressively physical with me (even though I had said I’m uncomfortable with PDA) in public spaces, pinning me up against walls/tables and making out with me roughly. \n\nMy friends noticed this and were always uncomfortable by it, and said they were worried for my safety. I brushed it off and made excuses, and kept seeing her.\n\nThe day after the assault my roommate made a joke about my hickey, saying something about how it looked like I’d had a fun night. I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do, or what had even happened.\n\nI still feel like it was my fault. I put myself in that situation, saw the red flags and kept telling myself it was okay. Every time she did something cruel or inappropriate she would say I deserved better and apologized. I always told her it was okay, and I put up with all of it.\n\nFinally I cut it off, after she told me she didn’t have the time to commit to our relationship and wasn’t going to be available much. I called it quits and told her we were done. She almost cried, for some reason, even though she had practically initiated the split. Mind you, we were never officially “together”, just seeing each other for around two months. \n\nI’m just now processing the assault after we’ve broken up. I’d rewritten in my head to be just a bad sexual experience. I’ve even lied about it to my friends about it being enjoyable, just rough. I’m having a really rough time coming to terms with it, and I think I’m finally feeling the effects of the trauma in full force.\n\nIf anyone else has had experience with female on female assault, please let me know any advice you have. I don’t know if I can continue to even say I’m a lesbian, as the word leaves a bad taste in mouth now. I don’t know how I can continue to date women. Anything having to do with sex just feels raw and wrong and violating. I don’t understand how people can enjoy it. I walked away from my first sexual encounter wondering if I was actually asexual because of how horrific it had been. I feel like a fraud even calling myself a lesbian anymore. I don’t know what I am.\n\nAny advice is graciously appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\n\nJust wondering if anyone else here has dealt with this, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of resources for lesbians/women who were raped/assaulted by other women. I’m 18F, also.",

Reddit can be a very rude place and it would be quite hard to tolerate that in this vulnerable post.\nIt’s my choice to stay in this relationship so please if you’re going to judge, at least add practical advice and be nice.\n\ntrigger warning: mentions of childhood rape.\n\nMy boyfriend has a porn addiction and we addressed like three times that it’s cheating but he kept hiding and lying over and over. Then he said it gave him more pleasure than me and that they were better. He said he takes it all back and didn’t mean any of it and won’t do it again. \n\nThat really messed with me, this happened maybe a month or so ago and I have been just as repulsed from sex, masturbation and ANYTHING inherently sexual. it makes me feel sick to think about. My boyfriend said it’s okay and to take my time and that he’s willing to do anything he can to help. I am trusting that he’s genuinely putting in effort to stop this addiction and I appreciate it of course, but my body and mind can’t let go of what he did and said I guess.?\n\nI think it’s also hard, since I’m feeling repulsed from it, it makes me think of more bad things that have happened in my life having to do with sex.\n\nthe two main bad things I think of on top of what my boyfriend did are:\n\n1. being raped as a child repeatedly by my stepdad\n\n2. my boyfriend being too friendly with his female friends, watching fifty shades of gray alone with them, letting his female friends show him her dildo, etc.\n\nIt feels sickening that I let all this happen. It feels like there’s something wrong with me. my boyfriend hasn’t done anything with his lady friends in a while because he currently has none and doesn’t want to pursue a friendship with ladies. he likes his male friends and it also makes me more comfortable him having just male friends so it really does work out.\n\nI just felt the need to explain all of this and put it all out on the table so somebody can give any advice or any kind words. I know I need a therapist but if there’s anything else I can do currently, I would appreciate the advice.\n\n",

Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.\n\nI’ve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school \"Jock”.\n\nHe always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).\n\nI get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he’s sorry (he’s said it so many times it doesn’t hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology \"I understand you probably hate my guts\".\n\nI accepted the apology because my dad told me to.\n\nSince then, I’ve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I’m not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.\n\nHe, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I’m doing well and he’s happy specifically for that.\n\nI just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said \"Man, I don’t remember saying that, clearly I did though, there’s no denying that photo. I honestly don’t remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that\".\n\nFor the sake of convenience of this post I’ll make it short. We went back and forth over it and he accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\\*\\*\\*d his ex and said how I can’t deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.\n\nI blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.\n\nHe says \"James, for the hundredth time, I’m done with these conversations. Chao for now\".\n\nI said \"for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can’t connect the dots on why you think it’s me who did that. Chao\".\n\nAfter a few days, I blocked him for good.\n\nLooking for advice",

        "Text": "Hey folks. Warning for potential violence and potential murder, it's not quite abuse so I'm not adding that tag. \n\nThe experiences that gave me PTSD were caused by one of my best friends who had PTSD themself, we lived together and due to certain circumstances I will not be discussing here, they were being triggered near-constantly. Their flashbacks were so bad that they would regularly forget who I was and would respond to certain situations violently, or sometimes they would get quiet and I would learn later that they were struggling not to attack me. I lived with them for about a month, and throughout that time I was never hurt, mostly through luck, coincidence, and a locked door.\n\nThat being said, it's been two years since I left. Unkind words were given on their part, I think because I was a constant in their life up until that point. But a few months ago, they reached out to me because of a personal situation that I could've had a stake in (I didn't) and we wound up talking about everything that happened. They were generally apologetic, and somehow we wound up saying that we would give friendship another try. \n\nWe mostly just play games together once a week, and discuss those games. We've strayed into serious conversations a few times, but I've put my foot down once or twice when we got too personal because we aren't close like that anymore. The thing is, though, I've been wondering lately whether talking again is even healthy?\n\nIt's complicated for me, because they used to be the person I looked up to the most, my best friend, the person I told everything to. Now I don't even tell them what I do for work and whether or not I'm in school. We just dance around everything that happened like it was an awkward moment for both of us. I enjoy talking to this person, I really do, but I don't know if it's going to hinder my recovery or not. My flashbacks were less frequent at first, and then they went back to their pre-reconciliation levels. They're not as upsetting anymore, but the distress has been replaced with confusion and frustration. My mood has also been more stable (I'm also bipolar). \n\nI don't think that they handled the situation well, really, but I also think that it's been two years and they know better now. Not perfectly well, but better. And I'm not going to ever see them in person again, I don't think, so they're never going to be in a position again where they could reasonably hurt me.\n\nSo, my question is, can this be healthy, considering all of the checks I've put on the relationship? Everyone around me is telling me that I'm making a mistake, but I care a lot about this person. A lot. They got me through some tough times, and I got them through some as well. I just don't know anymore. In any manner, thank you for reading. It means a lot.\n\nTLDR Is it possible to be friends with someone who nearly killed you?",

Other than a busted lip, some aches from points of impact from fist and the floor, I am physically ok. I could’ve seriously been hurt but luckily I wasn’t wearing my glasses, and I was able to fall safely \n\nI go home early and can only manage 4 hours of sleep. I then have to drive a family friend in my car for an hour. Which is really hard for me because I have severe trauma from being abused by my ex and grandfather inside a car. People in my car is a huge trigger. \n\nRight before I drive this person though, my ex texts me something weird. I’ve told my ex to NEVER contact me unless it was a family emergency of some type and I thought he understood this because I hadn’t heard from him in months. Anyways. It’s a screenshot of a tweet, obviously just like some harmless little meme and I would’ve excused it as maybe an accidental message not meant for me until I read what it said. \n\nIt said “murmuring ‘ok slay’ as someone shows me how to use a can opener” \n\nFor context, 8 years ago when I was 16 and dating him (we dated for 7 years, starting when I was 16) we were making dinner at my house. I had happened to have just never used a can opener before (weird, I know, but I was 16 and I didn’t really like canned foods so I never had to use one). \n\nSo I turn to him and I ask, “oh hey can you show me how to use this?” But for some reason this ANGERS him. He shuts down on me, tell me to “just look it up” (in a mean tone) and he’s like “you seriously don’t know how to use a can opener” and all around, it was just a cruel experience. He never did show me and he ended up ignoring me from how angry and stupid he thought I was \n\nAnyways. That was not an “ok slay” moment for me. I just have. No. Idea. WHY. He would send me a joke like that? I’m so confused? \n\nLike I’m just so hurt right now. And I might’ve brushed it off but like. I was violently attacked not even 12 hours prior to him texting me that out of the blue. \n\nAnd I’m just feeling so down on myself. I feel like I’m overreacting to everything that’s happened in the past 24 hours. Like I’m just being over dramatic and I should get over this but god it is so hard right now. My feelings hurt. My face hurts. I just want support and kind words right now and I feel like such crap for trying to ask my loved ones “hey can you be extra nice to me right now? I was assaulted and then my ex texted me”. \n\nI already told them all these details and like, they were pretty nice to me but idk it didn’t feel like enough? I don’t want to sound like a weird bitch by specifically asking them to be extra comforting to me. Or maybe they just don’t really know what else to say to me. But I feel awful for venting and feel awful for feeling like I want to be a little, idk, doted on? Is that so wrong? I don’t know if that’s wrong of me to feel or not.

        "Text": "Hi, I've never been here before, but I suppose it's the proper place on the internet to post. Posting on alt account for privacy. \\*\\*This became a little long, I'm sorry\\*\\*\n\nI've went through a pretty extensive psychological examination the last few months, with the initial goal just to go through ADHD, but we've went through a ton. I never thought I had PTSD or something like that, I never experienced flashbacks, any super triggering moments that that made me angry or something else, never happened. I'm also like the least agressive teddy bear there exists I think.\n\nNever really crossed my mind. But I did relate to a lot of things on the, whatever the English word, the tests you fill in, around Trauma and PTSD. But afterwards it sort of felt like an insult to people with \"actual PTSD\", that I had any thoughts surrounding that.\n\nWe had gone over things like my SA as a boy, abusive households, suicidality, amongst some other things that felt like they might be relevant in evaluating my mental health. The psychologist I talked to was absolutely amazing.\n\nI told him about one thing that I didn't have an answer to, where most of my \"inner self\", I feel I am relatively aware of, but this was one thing I didn't understand, and never had.\n\nI've had a \"bad feeling\", as I've started to call it, in giving up for searching for words like \"anxiety\", or whatever this \"bad feeling\", could be, since I've been around 11/12, I'm 25 now. This feeling is constant, I'm having it writing this, and everything I do, since then, aside from when I'm using drugs like benzos, or had in the past. Zopiclone managed to do that for me too somehow.\n\nIt was the only time, quite literally ever, where I felt at peace, I could relax, enjoy a  movie, or have a meal. Alcohol abuse was a thing too, but was far far less effective for the \"bad feeling\". It worked decently well for social anxiety though.\n\nIt felt far fetched that I had something like anxiety (literally) 24/7, regardless of situation. Whether I'm in love with a girl I'm dating with all the positive hormones through the roof, or going through something tough, the feeling always, always remains.\n\nI've heard of anxiety to describe \"moments\", of anxiety, that it wasn't constant. Still don't know if it is anxiety. It's not like I think of something and it gives me this \"bad feeling\", it just always is there, where ever I go, it follows.\n\nParanoia, and feeling like everything is going to go to hell, regardless of what it is, or how trivial.\n\nI seem to be physically unable to sleep like a normal human being, unless I'm on large dosages of medication. First time I ever slept since I was a child, like actually slept, was just an encounter with good, heavy sleep meds, which was relatively recent. Zopiclone only worked for a high. So I'm not on extreme insomnia at the very moment. Used to have constant nightmares, not as much anymore, but they come, and it's often repeated nightmares.\n\nTerrible confidence in every aspect. The outside can tell me that I'm attractive or that I'm smart, it all goes away though. Everyone has an ulterior motive in my mind, they must not mean it. I'm in this weird zone where I both need validation for those types of things, and also get very little out of the validation. Feel like everyone is just out to get me, sort of thing, even when I can recognize myself that it's completely irrational. And the world is not a safe space to be in.\n\nSuper low baseline mood, never really happy, I have periods of full blown depressions once in a while. It's hard for me to find things fun or enjoyable.\n\nI isolate myself completely, I dissociate from reality quite a bit.\n\nI don't know, we went over a lot of my life.\n\nI don't know how much of it is related to a PTSD diagnosis, or something else entirely, but it's there. Most of these did not exist before 11/12 y/o, but essentially all of it came after. Although some of it could just be a lot of other aspects.\n\nMy psychologist made the connection above, that my dumbass hadn't figured out, that the \"bad feeling\", amongst all else, coincidentally came after these childhood events. In a pretty focused time point. So we talked a lot about it. I asked him after all of it, what \"stood out\", he mentioned ADHD and things surrounding trauma. That these things were to persue all the way out. But PTSD, was still not on my mind. I was just like \"yeah I guess I might have a bit of a trauma issue perhaps\".\n\nCURRENT TIMES YAY!\n\nI go to finish an explanation of the results of a cognitive test I've made prior, and meet a different psychologist, not the dude I talked with. Turns out I get diagnosed with ADHD, and I'm not dumb (on paper) yay. Months work past me.\n\nBut, it was also, almost casually explained that I have a formal, real ass PTSD diagnosis. For whatever reason there was some miss match with a follow up for that, I suppose, and I got to hear that second-hand. And she was apologetic I remember. I look up my medical journal, and boom, a big ass, fat PTSD diagnosis up in there. She books me a time with a new psychologist for PTSD, the amazing guy is on family leave, yay.\n\nThis was a couple days ago, I'm now waiting for a follow up.\n\nI still don't really know what the actual fuck this means. What the implications are, how this is going to impact my life, if some of these things can get better, what the treatments are, I have no clue.\n\nSo I guess after the wall of text, my question I suppose is if anyone here at all can relate to any of this, if there are people here not suffering through flashbacks or things of that nature. Maybe someone has something to share :) And also I suppose I'm writing because I can't really tell people in my surroundings about this, so this is what I've got at the moment. And I suppose I'm trying to conquer my undying shame, so saying these things \"out loud\", to people outside of just my psychologists, is news for me. Thank you. And sorry if it's too much.\n\nEDIT: Hallucinations. I had to drop out of high school about 3 times before completing it due to a \"smelling\" hallucination, I don't know if it's to do with this.",

It’s important information for professionals in the future or anyone who needs my records to know. \nMe not being able to go outside or socialise is very relevant. My ptsd effects me greatly on its own and also effects my agoraphobia along with my bpd \n\nBut they just said “is the bpd not enough” and I had to plead my case as to why I want it for an hour\n\nI just feel like they’ve shown how little they understand me and want what’s best for me\n\n\nMy ptsd is from an abusive relationship but also repetitive sexual trauma. I’m in a supported accommodation which means I feel unable to do simple things like put the bins out because there’s staff everywhere and other people walking around the building and one of my traumas is from supported accommodation too.\n\nI get flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, I’m always on edge and uneasy but the main thing is how it effects all my other problems like agoraphobia and bpd. \n\nI experience structural dissociation due to my trauma, but apparently it isn’t something important enough to have on record? \n\nAnyway I just needed to vent ",

For instance, I would look at the shapes on the bathroom tiles and start seeing someone trying to look at me there.

The list is ridiculous.\n\nDespite that I managed over a decade of youth work, I'm ferocious about the protection of others.\n\nI came unstuck when I asked for help for the first time in my life about 6 years ago. I wasn't helped. I was blamed, shunned, judged and revictimised and I fought back with everything I had because it's always been in my nature to do so. I have the same ferocity for myself.\n\nI've proven that, I just find another gear and run on pure adrenaline until the danger is past and I can recover in private... till the next round.\n\nI recently (3ish months ago) got sober after becoming unstuck from the lack of support I had 6 years ago. Obviously substances made things worse and I've taken full responsibility for the hurt I've caused other people because of that.\n\nI'm still proccessing alot of horrific things that happened a year ago in therapy and I'm oscillating from rage to numbness constantly.\n\nI was starting to feel some stirrings of sadness about the whole situation when a man put his hands on me completely unprovoked in a inappropriate way (not SA) at the end of last week.\n\nBecause of that it launched me into a fight type ptsd response. The kind where your so enraged you could kill someone (and I stress I wouldn't - they are thoughts).\n\nI'm a woman and I'm feeling very unfeminine about having such violent reaction. I asked my therapist about if it's usually a male thing and they said \"usually.\"\n\nI think I'm feeling some shame about having had to become my own protector, others protector and I can't function normally anymore. I can't even hide the rage (I used to be able to hide anger)... this is different. It shows on my face and in my body language and I know it can scare some people because they don't know what's about to happen or if I'll lash out. It provokes anxiety and fear in other people and I never used to be like this. Alot more awful things happened to me in those 6 years and I'm... different again with the ptsd I have. It's like my nervous system and brain got rewired to fight mode when I was attempting to put the pieces of my life back together.\n\nThe worst thing I've done when I'm like this is break inanimate objects, throw things,, swear and slam doors. When I've calmed down enough I always apologise and mean it. I think it's because I no longer want to die so taking it all out on myself like I used to has caused the symptoms to flip into outward physical symptoms.\n\nI'm so fucking angry with the person who has set off the last round of this inside of me. I'll let it go but I'm still recovering from the aftermath currently.\n\nEdit: Context... edit again: context 🤦‍♀️",

We started pulling out the contents of the new bedroom so we could start putting our bed and other furniture in it. The the stuff we moved out of the room was put in the hallway ( we live in a trailer and there is only\none hallway ) I came to a scary realization that if someone broke in I would not be able to quickly get to the other end of my house where I store my gun to protect my wife and I.\nI then thought I saw something move at the end of the hallway on that end of the house. I immediately started panicking and felt trapped which turned into a huge episode, it took my wife almost an hour to calm me down and assure me there was no one inside other than us...\nThis has only seemed to get worse and not better.\nI used to only see things through my window or over my shoulder as I walked inside from my car.... Now I see things like this in my house all the time.\nI feel like a weak basket case that can't protect his own family.....\nMy final question is are these sort of vivid hallucinations common with ptsd?",

Ever since that event I have used and abused whatever I can to separate myself from reality. During my first hospitalization a few weeks ago, while unable to distract myself, I felt like it was the first time I could think clearly in years. Unfortunately it all came to an abrupt end when my mom called me and berated me for my decision to put myself into treatment. As a result I had one of the most extreme panic attacks of my life. A few hours later (following my parents demands) I lied to the nurses, told them I was over reacting, and left. Since this happened I have confided in friends about how hurtful this out of character reaction from my mother was. They surprisingly were not shocked and instead started to bring up instances of similar behavior. Personally, I have limited or even no recollection of most of the events they mentioned. After talking to them, a few nights later I just suddenly remembered a particularly painful (and in turn shocking) memory surrounding my parents. Admittedly it feels as though I cannot trust my own memory. My parents and I have had some very rough patches but I've always felt as though they had my best interests at heart. Could these be repressed memories? I feel like I could honestly be making this all up subconsciously because of what my friends have told me and my drug use. I have been wanting to talk to my parents about my substance use and desire for treatment and this whole internal conflict is preventing from doing so. ",

I realized I dont know much about l&i and so I looked into it. I saw some lawyer sites where says its legal (even for state workers) to be tracked by private investigators if they believe you can go back to work or are per my employers words “milking it”(this was said about a past employee on l&i claim when talking about continuing on light duty). Anyway, I have ptsd and have been stalked and the possibility of being followed triggers this. I don’t know how to go forward as I know its unlikely this is happening to me but still triggered me. I don’t know what to do as never used l&i before and feel like it is causing ptsd to worsen with fear of being followed again.\n\nTldr: my manager is saying something that feels wrong and i dont know how to respond as I dont know if i am overreacting if i do address it",

        "Text": "I can’t remember a time in my life where things were different. I was in dangerous situations from a young age, as I grew to a teenager, I put myself in a lot other dangerous situations with my temper and lack of control, and ego. \n\nI’ve been in a lot of altercations. I’ve been attacked many times, I’ve attacked people many times in retaliation. I’ve been jumped, beaten, kicked and stabbed at different times in my youth. \n\nI’ve lived a beautiful life for the last 2 and a half years or so now. I survived. Today I feel like random people who I just met are untrustworthy or trying to take something from me. I don’t let anyone walk behind me (I’ve been jumped from behind), I can’t trust anyone and I’m always in a state of tension and readiness. \n\nMy mind has cleared up a lot, I’ve talked thru a lot of the flashbacks and situations where me/people I love were almost killed. I’m very hopeful for the future and I live a good life, I cleaned up, got off drugs, went to college. I’m doing great. The faces of my old enemies began to not startle me anymore when I would see them in my head. \n\nBut I can’t just relax. I’m lying in bed rn, and the last thought I had was about an older man I met for the first time today, he literally was so nice and we had a good conversation… I was thinking about this as I lay down but then my head comes out with “if he tries to fuck me over I’m gonna kill him”. \n\nFor context, I’m a fit 19 year old man. He was far older and smaller than me. This thought made absolutely no sense. Why do I see innocent people as a threat? It’s not like I always see them this way but I can’t get the smoke to clear when the mood takes me. \n\nMy brain just said “why would this random man be nice to you” and it immediately became defensive. I come from a place where most people are extremely friendly unless you make enemies with them. It’s like I think everyone has an agenda, things they want that they’d be willing to fuck me over for. AND I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE\n\nI KNOW ITS NOT TRUE. \n\nI have been shown so many times that it is not true. It makes me feel like I truly am mentally ill, I’ve never known anything different. I’ve always been an upbeat guy, laughing all the time. When I was a child, before things happened, I used to only ever laugh or cry, there was nothing in between. I was always an intense kid. So maybe that doesn’t help. \n\nI just want so badly to come home and actually believe that the fighting is over, but I’m so UP all the time. It takes so little to set me off but the thing is I don’t even realise I’m “set off”. It’s just normal to me. And then I realise people are afraid of me, intimidated. Cos I’m in fight mode. \n\nLast night I couldn’t sleep, and I was sick for the whole day, my stomach was so weak and nervy. I felt cold. My body wouldn’t stop tho. Adrenaline kicked in at around 10am, just after I rested while on public transport for a while. \n\nGod I don’t know. I just wanna come home. \n\nIt hurts me so much that people I love are afraid of me when they feel the intensity. They don’t realise that in that moment I’m actually a lot more scared than they are… and there’s no good reason why anymore, it’s been over for years, they’re not coming anymore. \n\nBut I’m just scared. My body is scared. ",

        "Text": "Hello, hope everyone is doing well. Sorry if this is against the rules or a stupid post, I will delete it if people want me to.\n\nSo I've had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases I'm not sure. For example, I've never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if that's okay.\n\nWhen I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it might've been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldn't figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasn't eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along.\n\nNot long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded.\n\nBut after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I don't know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. I'm just numb all the time, I don't enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy (CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist) or medication (Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others I've forgotten) or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasn't doing anything. So now I'm stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things. I've read about things like the freeze response and it seems to make sense but I don't know what to do about it. \n\nSorry for the long post, I didn't know what was worth mentioning and what to omit",

When I was 8 I lived alone with my dad for a year, and all I know from that is that it wasn't good. I went to therapy when I was 11 and already then I couldn't remember the year with my dad. \n\nNow, I'm doing a lot better, I'm stable and pretty mentally healthy. I think that's why the lost year has suddenly kinda \"resurfaced\". I haven't been in touch with my dad in years, but wished him happy birthday a week or so ago, and since then things have kind of been chaotic. \n\nI want to remember what happened. After I moved away to stay with my mom, I was broken. Suicidal, depressed, I had daily panic attacks and nightmares most nights, and I was only 10. It's just not normal, and it makes me think something might have happened to make me that way.\n\nI know he was verbally abusive, and I was neglected pretty bad that year, but that doesn't kinda seem extreme enough for how bad I got? \n\nThere are also these snippets that make me worried I might have been assaulted, but I was 8 and its 20 years ago now, so how do I even trust whatever fragments I get ahold of?? How do I know what is a real memory, and what is just me projecting my worst fears? \n\nIf anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice. Unfortunately going back to therapy isn't an option right now.",

My therapist did say I'm \"traumatized\", referring to an event that happened 10 months ago, but nothing else.

The pediatric calls messed me up. I’m sure my childhood influenced that. I had an extremely painful surgery experience in April 2023 where they had to do a thoracotomy (cracked my chest bones) and scraped my lung away from my back. They also removed part of my lung. I woke up screaming in pain. I never recovered physically, mentally or emotionally. I already had PTSD but now it is focused on the medical field. I get anxious whenever I have to go to the doctor. I have 3 chronic conditions so I end up having to go to the doctor way too much. Since my surgery I have gone into respiratory distress a few times and my spouse called an ambulance. I would get terrified when I saw it and begin to cry plus I would pee myself. I am so ashamed and have begged my spouse to just let me die. Not sure why I’m posting this because no one but my spouse knows about the mounting anxiety, terror and shame I feel. ",

My last memory of the night was in a room with at least 4 men in and was later found by other hotel guests naked in the corridor and my stuff was dumped in the outside bins. I woke up the next morning in her room not knowing anything bad had happened until I heard her on the phone to the police. Condoms with my DNA were found inside the room. \n\nA part of me is angry and upset that people are like that out there, but I know of the evil in the world and have read about much worse. I feel like I’ve got over this.\n\nI’m also upset that I wasn’t more demanding of answers from police. I understand this was my brain in defence mode and believing it wasn’t true to protect myself. \n\nI’m angry at my ‘friend’ for totally abandoning me when I was extremely drunk. She’s not in my life anymore, she was always a shit friend and I should have never trusted her. I’m grateful that I know the kind of friend I deserve now. \n\nI’m angry that I got black out drunk so many times before that, always told myself I wouldn’t do it again, yet it kept happening. I’m annoyed that I drank so much around someone I had never gone out drinking with before. I’m guilty that I put my real friends through nights out with me as a liability. This I’m blaming on being young and not setting myself strict enough rules around drinking. I have learnt from this and I’m glad I will be safer in future.\n\nI also keep finding any excuse to make the men and their behaviour ok, like maybe I was compliant at first (still is rape). I’m telling myself I know nothing, anything could’ve happened. It wasn’t personal. \n\nI am still finding myself getting upset for reasons I don’t know. It’s not particularly affecting my mental well-being. I just hope this stops and doesn’t get any worse.",

        "Text": "First off CW for abuse, csa, hoarding, and ideation\n\nThis is my first time posting something like this on a reddit forum besides maybe some drawings on other forums. Reason why I'm here is for support and to connect with others who may have gone through similar.\n\nLittle bit of background I'm 21 and have delt with PTSD for as far back as middle school. I wasn't diagnosed until June of 2021 and have been struggling to figure out what this means for me since said diagnosis. One thing that you should know is I'm also AuDHD and have MDD for context.\n\nTo make things short, I came from a broken home, 3 siblings (C is currently 27yro, N is 24yro, I'm the 3rd born and my youngest sister Ce is 19yro as of writing) single mom who at the time I was born was divorcing my dad. My dad was abusive physically to my mom and had very untreated ADHD, his anger was out of control 99% of the time.\nI was too young to witness any of it, once I was old enough to remember anything he was already kicked out and out of my life.\nI was 5 when my moms new boyfriend moved in and later in life at 7-8 years old he would abuse me sexually, later found out all 4 of us kids were abused by him. He was also just a massive dickhead, who was (and I don't like using this word for this) a narcissist.\nHe started fights and loved to see and make my oldest sister who was severely autistic, extremely upset.\nShe would get so upset she would get into physical altercations with my mom almost on the daily and threaten her sisters including me that she would murder us in our sleep. We had to lock the knives away in a separate drawer.\n\nNeedless to say, little me didn't get much sleep at all as a kid. If I wasn't kept up by my sister and step dad having screaming matches, I was up awakened by panick attacks that my sister would one day come and kill us in our sleep. To this day I have insomnia because of high anxiety.\n\nMy paternal grandma was the only one who really took care of me. My mom wasn't in her right mind at the time of raising me and my grandma noticed at a young age I wasn't held as much as a mother should hold their infant. So my grandma held me many times I've had autistic meltdowns and my mom would disregard me as being difficult. My family never caught onto the fact I was AuDHD because in comparison to my high needs autistic sister, C, to them I was as neurotypical as they get. So I never got accommodations for my AuDHD.\n\nThe problem is my Grandma never really did anything to help with C's anger against my mom and step dad which would only end up in more arguments. My grandma meant a lot to me but by age 13 my mom had stopped taking us to our grandma's since she thought my grandma was only making things worse (and to an extent, she was).\n\nLeaving the only person who ever treated me with kindness dispite my AuDHD was only further destruction to my development (hence the PTSD diagnosis).\n\nJanuary 11th 2019 was the day my step-dad got outted for sexually abusing all of us kids. My sister, N, came into my room crying because my oldest sister C had told her that my step dad had groped her the other night. I had to call my mom from work and all I remember was the sound of my mom wailing over the phone begging N to say she was lying.\n\nWe called the cops. They took my sisters reports. And I stayed silent. I stayed silent because being the \"trouble child\" in my family as well as undiagnosed untreated AuDHD it was easy to blame me for a lot of things and dismiss me for my feelings and concerns due to me being \"unruly\". I thought at the time they would dismiss my assault just the same as everything else I had concerns of throughout my life.\n\nAfter that I knew no one was taking the grief well and neither was I. My family was just so angry at eachother blaming everyone for the fights the assaults, who deserved what more, who's fault it was, who caused it. Everyone was pointing fingers all at anyone but the man who assaulted us.\nI was excluded by my sisters for being \"papa's favorite\" since to them \"I was never assaulted\". Mom detached from us kids because every one of my sisters were mad at her for bringing her boyfriend into our lives only to traumatize us. Everyone blamed eachother for grieving. Everyone blamed eachother for not listening to what the other has to say.\n\nNo one was getting anywhere.\n\nI had known my mind was fucked up beyond imagination so I sought a counselor through my school who then refered me to a therapist office that provided my school services since my highschool was in a low income area of Seattle that had students who have been brought up in bad homes.\n\nI started therapy sophomore year of highschool and was diagnosed with Post traumatic stress at 17.\n\nI graduated during the pandemic, moved to Ellensburg WA to attend CWU for only 6 months before realizing I didn't have the funds to complete college. Then moved back home March of 2022\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. As I had promised myself I would never come back to my mom's house after graduating.\n\nI got a summer job that paid well then worked as a receptionist at a clinic in Seattle in September 2022. Come October I would meet my first boyfriend...now ex.\n\nMy relationship with my bf (well call him Jackie) was a breathe of fresh air. He lived in Bellevue and we hit it off pretty well through bumble. He lived with his parents since he was attending college and working and didn't make enough to move out and wasn't in school enough classes to move into dorms.\nHe came from a pretty privileged background his dad a white collar worker, a boss of a boss for a tech company in Seattle. His mom, too disabled to work and had to retire early.\nHe had one sibling, older than him that was moved out and attending school.\n\nEveryday was bliss. It went from getting yelled at by some patients family at work then going home to a house of family members who hated eachothers guts. I lived with my little sister in a small room and being both adults wasn't ideal at all, we would fight over space all the time. But my mom didn't have the money to move us to a larger house where we'd have our own space.\n\nBut on the weekends? The weekends....it was another world. The grass felt greener on the other side. Weekdays was long shifts and a hoarders house of spoiled milk and leftovers piled in a fridge. My mother and sisters fighting at night until I'd wake up at 4 in the morning to go back to work but the weekends....\n\nI went to Jackie's house. Clean food, clean water, no bug infestations, no fear of spoiled food and botulism, no fear of having to buy take out and sleeping in moldy bed sheets. The weekends. They were what I needed.\n\nHis parents knew that I was living in a bad home and made it known that I could go to their home at any time to escape for a breather before going back to work and paying off student loans.\n\nCome October last year I had to move into his parents due to my school charging me 200 more on my student loans each month. That along with paying moms rent and gas meant I was spending more money than I was making.\n\nI got into a huge argument with my mom, I asked her if I could spend less on rent due to an increase in loan payments and she didn't take it well. I took an uber to spend the night at Jackie's. I woke up with the idea to move in. The clinic that I worked at had a unit in Bellevue. If I had gone up the ladder from Receptionist to tech I'd be making more. But I'd be paying just the rent and loans instead of my mom's gas, the groceries, utilities ect ect ect.\nI talked with Jackie's parents and they let me stay, knowing I was in a bad home they set a plan for me to move in and work full time so I could pay off my debt. They said no matter what happened to Jackie and I, their house was a safe haven.\n\nJackie broke up with me on the 13th of October this year. 2 days after our 2nd anniversary. I'll save the details because that can be it's own post here since it relates heavily to my post traumatic.\n\nBut when we broke up, I had been kicked out by his parents. The break up wasn't over something bad that he or I did to eachother, we just realized we didn't work out since we were both dealing with stuff. Jackie was trying to deal with trauma they had gone through years ago that they didn't realize had effected them till he started to see it effect our relationship. And I the same.\n\nWe both agreed to split and go no contact. Our feelings towards eachother indifferent.\n\nI had to move back into my moms house. And it's been hard doing that while grieving my first relationship and my first LONG TERM relationship. My little sister, Ce, has been there for me but only for a bit until it exhausts her. I get it, my house is a family who hasn't properly grieved their traumas and don't believe in therapy (unfortunately).\n\nGetting back into this environment is hard. \n\nI have to walk on eggshells around my mom and sisters. The food here is spoiled and my mom keeps buying more food that only then becomes spoiled because there's no room in the fridge for it to be put in.\n\nTalking about the trash in the house has been hush hush. I get that working with hoarders it's very important to not make note of the hoarding and instead approach it from a point of understanding their trauma. But if I actually want to help my mom then it needs to involve an actual therapist to coach the act of removing the hoard.\n\nMy sister Ce has given up on trying to help my mom since she's tried everything and came to a point \"here. You're more likely to get kicked out by mom for mentioning the kitchen than you would catch botulism from 7 day old leftovers.\"\n\nThe first week moving back in after breaking up with Jackie, I was incredibly suicidal. I went back to the house I promised I wouldn't come back to. I was kicked out and into the house my exes parents promised they would not send me back to.\nI didn't have Jackie to text for support whenever the house became too much for me. Never mind I'm never welcomed into his home again, be it his parents or his future apartment.\n\nI have no one.\n\nThe only thing that's helped me is a couple of friend of mine I've reconnected with, listening to music especially Tyler, the creators new album, watching all the shows I used to watch with Jackie as well as the shows I promised him we would watch together.\n\nComing back to a house like this is extremely triggering. And it's hard to move out since everything is expensive and I'm still in debt so I don't have the credit score to get me a car or an apartment even if I wanted to or could afford it, I wouldn't get it with my score due to being in debt.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to get out of this all. But I hope to post more on here to connect with people who have post traumatic as I can expect will need a support group now that I'm back in a not so great environment.\n\nI'm trying to find hope everyday and everyday I'm finding a little bit of myself again after my break up.\nI still have my job, I'm so grateful for that and my boss for transferring me to a unit that's closest to my mom's place so I don't have to lose my job.\n\nI lost a home that accommodated my needs, a family who listened and understood me, a boyfriend who gave me the love I told myself I never deserved. I'm not about to lose my job.\n\nThere's hope. I'm not about to let all this get in the way of me getting out. Promise, I'm gon make it out.",

But anyway, I am struggling so much with food and eating right now and I don't know how to manage and how to get support.\n\nIt's always been this way with trauma. As a kid, I was abused for years and my eating was so affected that doctors had to get involved. Whenever I've had traumatic events, I just cannot eat. It's like when I'm in trauma, my body is just incompatible with food. It's not a weight thing, I don't care about my weight right now. At the start, it felt like an upside that I was getting to lose some weight but I'm starting to hate how much weight I've lost in the last two months. I look sick and I feel weak all the time. \n\nRight now, I just cannot eat unless I'm around other people or unless I guilt myself into trying to look after myself. I hate this so much. Food makes me feel nauseated to think about and it feels wrong in my mouth. Chewing feels disgusting and I have to distract myself to get it down my throat. I'm mildly panicking at the thought of trying to eat dinner alone tonight and I'm already trying to mentally justify why it's okay to skip it.\n\nCan anyone relate? I feel like such a freak and I tried posting on an eating disorder sub but it's not the same. I don't know how to heal this. I don't know how to feel safe eating food.

I have chronic pain and other medical issues on top of several mental health diagnoses and I often feel like they all tag team me to make sure I'm miserable. My baseline at most any given time is uncomfortable, which is always present in some way, even when I feel decent or am having a fun time. I hurt, inside and out.\n\nI can't get away from the memories. The triggers are everywhere and are immensely invasion. I feel everything so intensely that it takes everything in me not to resort to SH just to feel something different and in my control. I think about ending things more than I'd ever like my family and loved ones to know. \n\nI think about the spiritual side to things and all the existential questions. Why am I here? Why was I born? Is there a reason to this all or are we just some ant farm experiment from a sadistic higher power? I have my own thoughts about spirituality and am pagan, but I struggle hard. I'm angry that I'm here and a lot of the things I hear for an answer as to why I'm here in this life feel intensely disgusting to me and they don't make sense. I can't accept hearing that \"I chose to incarnate here for my soul contract in this life, so I'm going through all this because I agreed to it before I was born\" and the like. That feels victim blamy and yucky. It doesn't make me feel empowered. It makes me feel condemned from the start and like I'd like to strangle my spirit self for this, therefore I can't accept this being the way things are. This isn't up for debate here, I'm just mentioning this because it's where I'm coming from. I don't want a bunch of religious stuff debated or thrown at me. That's not why I'm here writing this.\n\nI just want to know how to cope with being in so much pain that existing hurts, living is a chore, and in turn, I'm pissed off that I'm here. This includes being angry about being thrust into living in a society that seems not to like people like me. I love my parents and all, but ffs... I'm so tired. ",

I have anxiety, depression, and flashbacks that interfere with my daily life such as work.\n\nAge 2-18 abused daily by parental units and some siblings (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritually). In my late teens started abusing myself (cutting), and then drugs and alcohol heavily until 26. Have been in recovery for drugs and alcohol almost 2 years now, and have seen countless therapists over the past 10 years. Working on seeing a new one that can do emdr.\n\nEverytime she threatens to leave (she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over) it sets my triggers off like you wouldn't believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i can't change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.\n\nI want to get better and have made some great progress the past couple years but it often seems like theres no end to it.\n\nTL;DR tell me there's some hope, I need some happy success stories with \"becoming a real person\" despite having ptsd.",

It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldn't. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didn't pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like \"what the hell man?\" but I didn't say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said \"calm down man, I'm sorry if I did anything that bothered you\" Something along those lines (I can't remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful). He pointed the gun at me and even hit me (it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me) to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didn't complain about anything, and acted like it wasn't a big deal, just telling him stuff like \"sorry, my bad\" (although I knew I didn't have to be sorry for anything). He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didn't go like that he couldn't say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything. ",

I don’t know what to think of it.\n\nMy dreams are usually about being raped at his house, the one he was in when my parents divorced. Whether by him, by a friend of his, or by his girlfriend, it’s always got something to do with him. One time he was the one abusing me. One time he found me in the aftermath and blamed me for it. One time it was his girlfriend. Nothing about these dreams is consistent except sexual violence and him being there. \n\nI also remember being terrified of undressing in his house. I didn’t feel safe. Getting ready for school was a nightmare and bathing made me sick to my stomach. I don’t know what I was so afraid of but I would have anxiety attacks about it. There are a few odd memories that stand out too. He once spanked me, pants and underwear down, as punishment for something when I was little. Another time I was undressed for a bath crying because I was so upset while he was watching me to make sure I actually bathed. He never abused me though. I think these dreams are just the wires crossing in my head between my sexual abuse (unrelated to my parents) and the feelings of abandonment from him leaving? I’m not sure, but it scares me",

All in good fun between close friends who are basically sisters ya know. I asked her to stop which she did imediately and apologised for making me feel uncomfortable. \n\nI then felt bad for setting the boundary and apologised to her for being weird about something innocious and something we are used to doing. She said i don't have to explain anything, i set a boundary and thats perfectly okay, i have body automony etc Everything was fine but i was worrying that id hurt her feelings. She it not someone who makes me feel bad/guilty about things but i felt bad, i dunno if its because we are used to people not listening to us or because im triggered (hate this word but its appropiate) at the moment. I can't have people touch me even in a friendly way at the moment even for hugs if i've not initiated it myself and usually i've been  fine. \n\nAnyway the details aren't really the issue its just more why do we feel bad about setting boundaries?

So doing stat Dec now. I was an apprentice (plumber), I'm extremely tough and I'm as tough as they come (I'm not boasting, its fact I was unbreakable), the company, 1 boss, 1 apprentice, company pays late all the time, boss was a narcissist, the anger the shouting all that jazz, paid annual leave 3 weeks after NYE THE FU**I*G DOG. Didn't bother me, I was good until 2022, caught by police unregistered work van (3rd time caught over a 5 month span THIS is when I mentally SNAPPED or soul left body), I used the van to go tafe for exams that day, that day I became an alcoholic, did too much for someone and left myself to shit like a slave. Overworked and red-lining, as in instead of working optimal like average society just turn up to work and go home do 9 to 5 where its somewhat pleasing, chat with co-workers, bludge a bit, pull sickies, not to worry much kinda things, proper company rules regarding employee saftey and treatement, no abusive behaviour, everyone respectfully monitored but my position? Throw all that shit out the window: this place required operating over the maximum capacity everyday, I was born for this but c'mon EVERYDAY! well super rare to get chill days (this is long story short.)\n\nI printed 400 pages of bank statements, THEREFORE required to highlight wages paid as there were no payslips; company did not do group certificates, and instead of just high lighting the wages I went further resurfacing and writing down small entries I remember in a journal when seeing the dates and leaving notes on the bank statements, I found means to go through photos, messages, spending 5 hours on separate days apart through a 4 week period, marking days of trauma/what happened on normal days, I have successfully conjured the state that was in the past as of 25 OCT 2024. That meant I was sober for 5 months and I have decided to intentionally drink just to feel more of that old pain so I could write what that old self was feeling. Bringing my old self back who I tried killing.\n\nIf I've come this far why turn back? Before you all say it's a mistake, you must believe these following words; I am in control of this, I am powerful, it's just that this particular suffering that I spent a year forgetting never disappeared, everything I've overcame is not on any scale, my instinct leads me knowing Im ready to face my past and learn)\n\nMy tax is almost done 10% left. It was tough going through it and doing all this can be reused for another purpose like super insurance claims and workers comp documentation. Making a claim was never my intention but it seems as I'm doing my tax, it appears as though my notes reliving the past serve an extra purpose.\n\nFYI: I stopped work July 19 2024 due to being diagnosed with AVN avascular necrosis. I cannot work like normal again. Hip needs surgery and I'm 33. Thankyou but I don't need sympathy as I am already humbled by my faith and my good Lord. I have time now to do this as I'm on a waiting list for surgery. Wait period is up to 12 months. ",

It was really fun then suddenly halfway through I became myself again. And I started bawling my eyes out crying. \n\nI wish I could fully go back man. Maybe I could’ve avoided it and my childhood would’ve been intact just a little longer. Im the complete opposite of who I was back then. If pre trauma me found out what a monster I’ve become she’d be devastated.",

Every year it seems like fireworks goes on for more & more days. It used to be maybe 4 or 5 days a year. Now it can be 4-5 days just for Halloween, & bonfire night is just around the corner, when it will all start again.",

        "Text": "Hi I hope this type of post is allowed. NOT asking for medical or diagnostic help!! Just wondering if current symptoms align with any accepted knowledge about ptsd/ART/ phobias. \n\n I had pretty bad diagnosed ptsd after a single incident a few years ago. Happened when I was 18, received ART advance resolution therapy at 20 and it genuinely felt like I was “cured” for years (specific triggers sometimes but not the regular day-to-day). \n\nI’m 23 now and I think a lot of it is back. But for no reason. I’m aware of retraumatization but NOTHING happened. I just noticed hyper-vigilance, tunnel vision, and mild dissociation is occurring now whenever I’m out at night, even in groups of people and in “safe” environments. \n\nI have a really bad phobia unrelated to ptsd (fully irrational one) and lately it has been so bad that I am constantly panicking no matter where I am. The thing is— I’ve noticed my phobia gets more active when other things are at issue and although it’s always bad, it isn’t always “can’t walk down the street at night” bad. So when I’m having my hypervigilance etc. walking at night I am actively panicking about my phobia but the symptoms match what ptsd was like for me and are the same severity of my ptsd hypervigilance when the phobia version was never THAT bad. \n\nIn short—can ptsd randomly resurface with no external factors after years of it not really being an issue due to ART? And it is it possible that it’s the PTSD leftover even if I’m actively thinking (in the moment) that the panic is from a phobia?",

They began to sit me up to take my clothes off. I could feel their and the doctors’ hands touching me all over and holding me up. I could see my head drooping forward as they began to put the hospital robe on me. In the present I could feel the weight of their actions pressing on me and I couldn’t help but brace myself, tighten my glutes because they felt the most vulnerable and shake. I wish it hadn’t happened like this. I wish they cared for me and didn’t spend a lifetime neglecting me. Once I got out I thought of the way my parents used to hold me down firmly as I screamed and cried and said I was scared because during the ophthalmology check up the doctor would ask the secretary to put stinging eye drops on me that would dilate my pupil and prevent me from seeing. I felt so vulnerable and violated and scared. This would happened yearly. They would never pay me any mind, wouldn’t console me but simply stare and minimize my experience with their words. I wish I had parents who understood their actions and had the guts to face them and tell me they were wrong. Hell my throat hurts from writing this.",

Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.\n\nI’ve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school \"Jock”.\n\nHe always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).\n\nI get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he’s sorry (he’s said it so many times it doesn’t hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology \"I understand you probably hate my guts\".\n\nI accepted the apology because my dad told me to.\n\nSince then, I’ve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I’m not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.\n\nHe, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I’m doing well and he’s happy specifically for that.\n\nI just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said \"Man, I don’t remember saying that, clearly I did though, there’s no denying that photo. I honestly don’t remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that\".\n\nFor the sake of convenience of this post I’ll make it short. We went back and forth over it ((and he said \"James, deep down, do you really want to message me day in day out about this? God doesnt want this for you man, im not him but i think hed want you to forigive and heal) and he then accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\\*\\*\\*d his ex and said how I can’t deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.\n\nI blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.\n\nHe says \"James, for the hundredth time, I’m done with these conversations. Chao for now\".\n\nI said \"for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can’t connect the dots on why you think it’s me who did that. Chao\".\n\nAfter a few days, I blocked him for good.\n\nAny Advice would be appreciated and welcome",

        "Text": "I have been seeing my T for trauma and to do EMDR (along with talk therapy and CBT). One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is that whenever I retell my trauma stories or tell her about a difficult experience, she'll just respond with \"okay\" as I'm telling the story and at the end. I know Ts needs to be neutral, not show any emotion/intense reactions and be nonjudgmental when clients disclose trauma, but it makes me feel crazy when I talk about something horrific and I get \"okay\" in response as if I just said I'm thinking of waffles over pancakes for breakfast tomorrow. It makes me feel many things, like she's not seeing the seriousness of what I am sharing or that she's not really listening.\n\nTwo months ago, I was telling T about one of my worst traumas: a major medical procedure in childhood where I was on the brink of death. The doctors were very callous towards me during and then after in recovery, even as I, for example, screamed bloody murder and was scared out of my mind and in pain. As I'm telling the story, with each horrible detail, I just get \"okay\" in response and then \"yeah, back then doctors didn't understand the psychological impact medical procedures had on kids.\" Nothing even close to \"wow, that was horrible you went through something like that\" or \"it was wrong that they ignored your physical and mental suffering.\"\n\nLast month, I told her about the horror of recently going to get bloodwork and how they wouldn't let me lie down to do it so I ended up passing out on the floor. They tried lifting me and whacked my head hard on the floor instead. I managed to get up myself when they shook me awake, only to feel nauseous and vomit all over myself and collapse to the ground. At each point in the story, T goes just goes \"okay\" and then \"we can do some EMDR around that experience.\" Again, T registers no shock or surprise at this experience and no reaction when I angrily ranted about the people at the lab, not even acknowledging that they behaved wrongly and inappropriately. I know she isn't supposed to pass judgment, but is she really not allowed to acknowledge that someone was obviously wrong?\n\nEdit: I want to add that the \"okay\" response is for everything I bring to therapy, even if it's not trauma and just shitty experience. Some guy was riding my bumper and honking at me for three miles nonstop so I felt unbearably anxious? \"Okay.\" A dentist's office lied to me about how much I'd have to pay out-of-pocket and charged me more? \"Okay.\" An extended family member tricked me to get some money from me? \"Okay.\" It's become maddening to me that T can never say or validate that those things or people are not right.",

Long story short, lots of drugs and alcohol and whatever else I could do to numb myself. But now, as I’m actually living fairly sober, I’m noticing I get very overwhelmed by how I structure my day. At first, I wasn’t doing jack shit. I work from home, so I’d just do that and play with my dog. literally the end of my day. Now, I’m really into fitness and have been for a few months, but there are some days where just thinking about having to work AND squeeze in a 40 min workout completely overwhelms me. I’m still able to do these things, but there’s a basically a mini meltdown in my brain for a good 2-3 mins. As long as I keep my feet moving, I’m fine. But it’s been getting worse and worse lately. I know I’m mentally better off when I have a very regimented schedule but now it feels like it’s too much? And when I think about it in the grand scheme of things, I’m not doing any more than I have in the past. I’ve had to go into work and be a real adult even when at my worst and it didn’t feel this overwhelming. In addition to this, any time I leave my house for any reason, I’m nervous as shit. And it’s never anything specific, just a pit of fear in my stomach. I could be going to see family and I have to take something beforehand just to cope. Once I’m there, I’m good. It’s the getting there part. I had a date last night and almost threw up during the date. I’ve never been this way.\n\nAm I still getting acclimated to my brain? Does anyone else experience this?\n\nOn another note, there are some other signs that may point to ADHD…I don’t want to self diagnose by any means, but it has been hinted that ADHD could be the case even by others. I have a doc appointment Monday to discuss but man, I just feel like I’m either a piece of shit or I’m killing it but it’s killing my brain.\n\nTLDR; getting into a healthy routine overwhelms me.

        "Text": "Hi all 👋 I need to know if there's people like me out there. For context I'm a previously healthy 27yo female and 2 years ago had an unexpected massive MCA stroke. I was treated very quickly with a powerful clot-busting infusion which reversed 70% of the effects. It also triggered severe haemorrhage from some undiagnosed stomach ulcers (read: projectile vomiting pints of blood) which sent me to a resuscitation bay for an hour and a half.\n\nI'm a veterinary surgeon by profession and during periods of consciousness fully understood the direness of the situation medically speaking. I probably would have at least offered euthanasia if this were happening to a dog. I experienced truly awful physical sensations including many different types and severities of pain, nausea, gasping air-hunger, pissing myself, and a relentless volley of non-consensual touch such as stripping/cutting of my clothes, attempts to access veins all over, urinary catheterisation, oral suction, and awakening to find a man cutting into my groin to place a pacemaking wire into my heart. Twice I politely asked a nurse if I was dying and twice I was told I was in the best hands (yikes).\n\nI was told it was looking bad enough to need a medically induced coma but that survival to successful intubation in cases like this was poor. I was offered a priest but not access to my family in that moment(??). Ultimately they skillfully avoided the need for intubation by putting an endoscope down my throat and cauterising the bleeding while I choked on both the endoscope and my own blood. Don't get me wrong, I am actually grateful for that and impressed by it having performed lots of endoscopy myself.\n\nOnce stable, I spent time in ICU where the psychological trauma manifested itself as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) resulting in heart-attack-like symptoms and a couple of days of treatment for heart failure which did resolve.\n\nAfter this was a relatively short (2 week) stint in stroke rehab where at the same time a region of skin died and fell off the inside of my right arm owing to escape of a drug under the skin during resus.\n\nEmotionally, I had moments of raw fear for my family knowing the pain it would cause to lose me. I also quite naturally don't like pain or unexpected rough/intimate touch. But other than that, I cruised through the whole thing with a sense of acceptance and calmness, including the possibility of death. That especially wasn't a problem, in fact at moments I would have welcomed it as a relief.\n\nI live on multiple medications and have some problems with strength, sensation, vision, fatigue and pain. But I have also since become an amateur climber and mountaineer in defiance. People ask about my visible scars, but I can speak openly about the experience and do so with a sense of humour and excellent story-telling. My partner (who I had not met at the time) finds this shocking. I have learnt information and techniques from the experience that I use on my patients.\n\nI sometimes have dreams about drowning in blood and flickering ceiling panel lights give me enough sense of unease to try and move to a different room (I stared at one above me in resus). The sound of curtains on rails makes my hair stand up a bit. But that is all.\n\nI declined every offer to see a psychotherapist or counsellor afterwards, didn't want to waste their appointments. I was raised by two nurses to be resilient and non-complaining, and I treat animals in various states of trauma every day. But I'm still surprised by how unaffected I am.\n\nAre there others like me out there? Am I lucky to have the right brain chemistry to handle this, have my parents raised me well, am I a psychopath, or is this actually just suppression and in your experience is there a possibility this could all come out later in a big mess? Should I bother seeing a professional or can I just keep blissfully living my second life? I don't want to have to unpack it all unless absolutely necessary\n\nThank you all, and I'm sorry in advance that you have lived experiences that mean you are here to read this and respond. ",

        "Text": "I'll have days or points where I'm ok but then something happens that's a bit upsetting and it sends me into a giant depressive spiral.\n\nEven if it has nothing to do with my trauma, something negative popping up puts my head in a place to think about everything and anything else that hurt me, or is bothering me and when I get in that mindset I don't have the clarity to pull myself aside or stop myself in the depressive spiral.\n\nFor instance last night my boyfriend clarified to me that he didn't like me having a wish list and that it bothered him that I would just go to him for those things, I'm disabled and when I can't cover some things currently I feel more comfortable trying to find a way to get them on my own (nothing illegal) than risking feeling like a mooch despite that not really being an issue with my bf. I grew up with my mother as a single parent and to put it briefly I alway watch what I get and feel guilty or wrong when getting things I don't necessarily need.\n\nSo I made the wishlist as a \"if anyone feels like it, feel free to take a look\" essentially no obligation just it's there if anyone would like to. The items I put on it are items I hope or intend to get in the future either for my cat who has osteoarthritis or for me to help with rough points of my disabilities or to help me further my education and studies.\n\nMy boyfriend didn't say anything bad and actively promoted it the first time, then yesterday this time the second time I promoted it he had an issue with it and said it was about principal.\n\nI wasn't promoting it in anyway that was wrong relationship wise or suggestive/nsfw and there's nothing like that on my list. I simply mentioned it  very off to the side and not in tour face of an account of mine.\n\nHe had an issue with it, and was insinuating I should delete it. I went ahead and did but I let him know I was disappointed that it was an issue and that he disliked it so much, I by the end told him that I'd like him to clarify more why it bothered him as he really only gave \"a matter of principal\" and \"I really don't like any online relationships\" (it's an anonymous wishlist so idk what he means, and I made sure he knew the wishlist wouldn't have me talking to anyone or vise versa or revealing any personal info.)\n\nI was upset after this because the night I repromoted it I had added a good amount more and had put a good amount of time into picking things out and adding little descriptions.\n\nBy the end of all this I deleted anything promoting the wishlist and any links to them but I was upset it felt like I had to do that at all. I let him know I wasn't happy with the outcome and didn't really get to finish before he decide he was gonna head back to bed cutting me off in the process. (I have asked him not to start uncomfortable or messed up conversations/the like before bed at a point before this because his go to is to start it and then cut it off when he realizes it's late despite it already being late when he brought it up.)\n\nSo I went to bed upset when I had been good and then the spirals started, I started feeling down fell asleep, woke up again during the night in a depressive mental state couldn't sleep to almost 5 am and during the time I let him know about the other things that were bothering me or had me in a bad mindset. (Our time zones are different right now so when it was almost 5 for me it was regular morning hours for him)\n\nAnd I just UHG I'm so tired and exhausted of deteriorating into these spirals and then feeling like a giant burden after.\n\nI can't control them and I don't know what to do. My therapist has given me ways to try and break the spiral but I feel that don't really do anything and I'm still in the same spot mentally.\n\nI'm insanely lonely and all I have right now is my cat, family is abusive and or far away and don't reach out much. Family friend is also out of the country and was supposed to vome back sooned but made the assumrion that I'm fine because i'm doing well with my studies and decide to stay longer without talking to me, my boyfriend is studying abroad and gets exhausted with any sort of emotionally taxing conversations and just shuts down most of the time, and I have no emotional support network I'm completely alone and I'm ok sometimes and then I have days where I just break down and can't handle it, and then I can't even vent that much because no one can handle it or is abusive and I can't share this stuff with them.\n\nI feel like I'm losing my mind, I can't get anything more important done without help and I have little to none right now and the help I do have is anxiety inducing and very spotty/unreliable.\n\nI'm trying so hard and I don't know what to do",

Some of the biggest stories involve abuse far more severe than my own, and it makes me mad at myself that instead of creating my own small business and becoming an \"inspiration\" I struggle to get out of bed, brush my hair and feel anxiety talking to a cashier. \n\nI'm not sure if they never had those years of being stuck, realising they don't have an identity outside of their trauma, lack of drive to do anything and feeling alien from every regular person around them because no one could possibly relate. Did they share their story back then or hide it? Was adjusting to the real world also incredibly hard to do? Were they also emotionally unstable? Did they deal with years of foggy memories and fatigue? Did they also feel more hopeless outside of the abuse? \n\nIdk, it's just hard trying to find examples of success where it doesn't jump from the worst things I've heard to suddenly having a loving family, living upper middle class and being believed. I would be heartbroken if they were putting on an act, but I wish they would talk more about how long it took to actually recover. ",

        "Text": "I was born with severe astigmatism and strabismus (exotropia) on my left eye. After appointments made with approx. 8 doctors, they kept measuring the angle of my eyes I grew to know when the right time for surgery was. I was three years old when my parents lied to me. They hadn't allowed me to eat anything all day, saying we'd get fast food after we \"visited grandma at the hospital\". I was happy about it so we took the car. We stayed waiting in the waiting room for at least 2 hours. Suddenly, who I now know at the my ophthalmologist of like 10 years walked in and called us in a room. There was a painting of a ship battling a wild tide, more chairs with fake leather and those gold buttons lining them. I was asked if I wanted a drink. He came in with a white plastic cup filled with orange juice: but it looked dull, grey-ish, and smelled fishy. I tried a small sip and didn't like it, but I was pressured into drinking it all. I noticed my parents staring at me with tears in their eyes, crying. I felt panicked/distressed at the site, but suddenly my eyelids began to droop, I felt heavy, swaying on my feet. I felt sleepy in the most artificial way possible. They sedated me. My mom held me in her arms as I finally succumbed to the drug. I woke up with excruciating pain in my left eye. They'd covered it with one of their white patches. I was in hospital clothes on a hospital bed in hospital room. My grandma had never been there. A lady I didn't know came in with a dinosaur plushie, saying she was rewarding for being brave. I didn't know what she was talking about, I think they had me on other painkiller drugs. My parents never cared beyond my physical state, never asked how I felt ever in my life. They lied to me about everything. At the doctor's they would kick me out of the room, look at me weirdly and slam the door in my face any time my surgery had to be talked about. When I had the courage to bring it up, once I was beginning to remember the more I grew, they could only talk about how THEIR actions hurt THEM, not even acknowledging my struggle. My trauma manifested a lot in my dramatic play with dolls. They somehow always ended up drugged and at the hospital and then the scenario would go blank. It was as if my mind was asking me \"what next?\" I experienced severe reactions once I fully remembered everything at age 12. I felt so betrayed, anxious, and terrified of my family. Whenever I set a boundary such as \"don't touch me\", they always violated it despite my protests and fear every time. It still happens. I was severely emotionally neglected in all aspects. Later on, I began feeling the hands of the surgeons crawling up my back, and grabbing my ass and squeezing it. I would get flashbacks of myself unconscious getting stripped of my clothes by strangers, without my knowledge or consent. How they had to open my eyes with their fingers and tools while they operated on me, and my gaze being blank, innocent, unaware. I'm shaking while I'm writing this. I felt a complete loss over my body, I am 17 now and full relaxation is the most daunting thing to do. I have refused to ever attend services like spas or massages in fear of having to lay facing down naked. I have frequent and intense thoughts of rape and it is one of my worst fears. It's just the fact that I was an innocent girl getting touched by strangers, even in a non-exploitative way, their hands all over my body, then literally opening and slicing and stitching it while my parents did absolutely nothing. Told me nothing. Offered me no support. Avoided me. Left me and every possibility of a good childhood seep into oblivion. I wish I could say I value family, but it is what I fear the most. I'm having trouble expressing this right now but I am hoping you people will have something consoling to say. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate you. I have never been comforted on the matter before.",

I work as a maintenance man at a housing complex. The job was to remove a toilet and replace it with a new one. I completed that task and was throwing the toilet away in a dumpster. Somewhere in the process the bottom had gotten broken. The toilet bounced when I threw it in. It slice me write down the middle of my arm, the inner part right at the elbow. I looked down and it was wide open. I grabbed it and started holding it together. Bleeding all the way back to my car. I started asking for help. Someone who was they're trimming trees saw me. She immediately took off her belt And applied it as a turnicate. It was gushing pretty bad. But thankfully she slowed it and I owe her my life. I had lost so much blood.At that point I started throwing up and then lost my vision And also having trouble hearing. When the ambulance arrived. I was in and out of it. When I arrived at the hospital It became one of the worst experiences of my life. Because of the emergency they couldn't give me any pain medication at that point. Because it had sliced me down to the bone and severed the artery. They started sewing it without any pain medication. I felt everything really bad hand pain because of the turnicate. At that point they had started given me blood, my vision started coming back. When they finished with the artery , they were able to give me pain medication. I was kind of in shock at that point. They were actually surprised buy how calm I had been threw the whole thing. I think that to because I was dying. I was told I lost over three liters of blood. People always talk about that. Seeing the light or other things like that. What I saw was a literal flash of my life. I was thinking of my wife and kids. Family and friends I had lost contact with. Family and friends that I had lost ect. This next part, I will make short.It could actually be a whole separate story. I was cleared to work only after ten days. I came back and I still think I was in shock. I lifted a water heater hurt myself again. Then was out another three months. When I came back my employer Just treated me like trash and has been for awhile. I came back with restrictions.  When they were up They came up with minor reasons to give me right ups, to make me look bad. I believe they were doing this to set me up to get fired or something. The accident happened in September 2023. I have all sorts of nerve and muscle issues, And don't have the strength or confidence to find a new job yet or else I wouldn't be here. I've just been feeling horrible about myself. Have constantly thinking about death and the accident. Don't know what to do, or where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

In the immediate aftermath I had either nightmares or breakdowns or both of all kinds of hellish things where I literally thought I was in hell. It gave me CPTSD. After things were better for me, I sought out help first from a psychiatrist who gave me daytime Prazosin and Buspar which helped a lot. Then I started seeing a psychologist who might be helping already. But as I become more and more me, I'm walking around just agreeing with people a lot less. I don't agree with them so I say so. One of my dearest relationships was with my now-grown nephew. He bluntly told me he was ready to choke me when I was so sick because all I did was agree with what he had just said. It was all I could do. Now I can do more. So I've told him a few times when I see things differently and he gets offended and won't talk to me for a day or two. The problem is, he's 29 years old and only wants to talk about the video game he's playing, the movie he's watching, or the new toy he bought. It's better when we're together, but I never see him in person. On the phone, when he will (I'm not making this up) give me permission to call him, I talk a lot more but he doesn't say that much. I want him to be happy and have the things he wants. But our family is full of people who are having a lot of problems and our country is having a lot of problems, and I get to hear about the 99th remaster of Doom. Who gives a fuck? I asked for permission to talk to him last night and he said \"I really don't feel like it. I had a busy day at work.\" I told him I'd try to pretend that wasn't really hurtful and said goodnight. He said nothing and no thing ever since. When you need permission to call, when talking to someone is such a chore that a busy day at work makes you too tired to endure it, is there a relationship left to save? When I was going through my very bad time he barely made an appearance. I had thought of him as one of my closest friends. He said he could tell there was something wrong with me, but i would talk about it. So he just quit coming around. Thanks for caring. Now I feel like, if I lose this relationship, am I losing anything? It hurts me to think about this stuff. It hurts me the way he treats me. We were close until I got sick, then he got bored and moved on. Me and my ex-wife were close until I got PTSD, then she didn't like that I had been so sick so she started cheating on me then left me. When you get PTSD, even if you don't abuse them, do people just walk away from you? How do you even go about finding new people. My world is almost empty. If I'm driving people away to figure out how before there's nobody left. If I have to pretend I agree with everything people say and never give my opinion to be in a relationship with them, am I in a relationship with them?",

She then had signs that she had another fling with her boy best friend, but she still remained nice to me, but she became more distant. Then, New Year starts, I’m still depressed, in grief and sadness, then on February 16 2024 something like that recently, she rejected me in a mean way. Her friends told me to get lost in the school’s campus, then a student with ADHD bullied me by chasing and hunting me down in my school’s campus every recess and lunch and throwing his water jug at me into my manhood. Because of this, my face got burnt, I had flakes everywhere, my skin started exfoliating and I was ultimately depressed to the point where my acads started going down. I managed to cope my acads even more by the end of the school year, but until now, I still can feel the trauma that happened recently. I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression and Anxiety this August and I’m undergoing treatment. I also stopped schooling due to Depression to let me rest and heal my mental wellbeing. I was now told to resume doing my hobbies to help me improve my mental health and quality of life, but unfortunately, several permanent alterations have been made to me after this School Year. I never see women like I used to before, I always think that they’ll hate me, and compliment me in a fake way, I acted differently in stores out of fear of being a burden to employees while they approached me.

My social life, romantic life, etc. suck and I am living with mom (36/m).\n\nI go to therapy, somatic approaches and have a daily meditation practice and journal. I've had some small wins. I just feel weird around everyone else, like nobody gets it.\n\nHas PTSD affected you? I'd really like to hear from you. I feel really alone in this \"club\" now.",

I hope I can forget about this in the morning but it has destroyed me for the last couple of months. \n\nTW: Staturatory/Grooming/Emotional and physical abuse/mention of SA\n\nSo when I was 15, I was freshly traumatized from being SA'd by my friend and was quite frankly very messed up. I wound up meeting a guy in high school we'll call Victor. Vuctoe was someone that kept to himself, only had a couple friends, etc. We shared the same (awful) friend group and this started a relationship I wish I was never apart of. Note at this time he was 19, I was 15, and I took of it being wrong but he played all the right cords and every little lie and promise so that I would trust him. I started noticing alarming things when his family member would make comments like \"you'll find better hook ups in college\" and no one corrected the brothers behavior. He wound up convincing me to give up my v card in exchange for his and I'll never forget him and his father shaming me for it and making me make a promise that I would never tell my mother about me and him having sex because in his words \"I would go to jail.\" It continued through the years but it wasn't the sex that wasn't the only thing. His parents shamed me for having a disorder I couldn't control and having a menstrual disorder that I also couldn't control. I later found out me not controlling it was because of the extreme stress he put me under. When we graduated high school together, I wound up doing a vast majority of his college work including essays, math work, assignments, etc. During this I was shamed often, locked out of conversations when he got upset and would ghost me, threaten to leave me, and when he'd be \"better\" it turned into love bombing in which I fell all over again because I swore he loved me. He dumped me back in late May and by the time he did, he was abusing edibles because he wanted a \"happy\" feeling. All we did was fight, and when he broke up with me it was like the gates of heaven opened. I felt a lot of weight off my shoulders. However then the harassment started a couple days later. Him telling me he couldn't live without me, that he loved me, that he needed me, etc because I wouldn't respond and just left him on seen. I had to file a police report because he showed up to my house, my father had to get involved to tell him to leave me alone and not come back, it was horrific. Now six months later, I'm in a new relationship and although I'm very happy I am horrified and angry at the things I have seen and the questions that have been answered as to why I felt so bad both physically and mentally. I'm angry almost everyday, I'm writing my ass off everyday in my notes app and never posting, and him and family members of his continue to stalk my social media frequently, and I've now had to block several accounts from both him and his family. I am sick. I am tired. I want peace and quiet without having to feel like I'm so unloveable because someone tore me when I was already down. I wish I wasn't so stupid and shattered as a teenager that it drives me crazy. I feel like I cannot be loved and that I'm not worthy of it. Frequent nightmares of him getting violent and putting his hands on me, etc. I'm just tired. I want to be free from the anguish I went through. I wasn't the best person either but I wish someone understood.",

I remember my shirt was lifted up and he was touching my cl!t. I screamed my mom’s name but she didn’t hear me. He also left without saying anything after i screamed. I was flabbergasted about what just happened but i went back to sleep. When i woke up, I told my mom about this later after it happened but she didn’t believe me at all. She only believed me when her husband admitted it like months later. Because of this, i always act like a “bitch” around both of them. Arguing is very common in our household and my mom always blames these on me. She keeps telling me I need to grow up and that it’s easy to get along with her husband if I just act nice towards him. But im only like this because of what he did to me; anytime I told my mom this, she scoffs it off and tells me that it’s just my excuse for acting like a bitch. She doesn’t even side with me. It was four years ago and i haven’t told the authorities about this but i really want to because it’s troubling my mind ever since then, and it will probably be like that forever. One reason i dont wanna tell the authorities is bc hes really old and is very sick so i dont want him to spend his last year behind bars. But i might tell the authorities because im getting tired of him always arguing with me and my mom. Hes very verbally abusive. Also i have proof of him admitting he touched me. i js dont know what to do with it. I might tell my school counselor about this but i dont know what will happen to me. My mom will probably hate me and i will probably be sent back to my home country, which i dont want to happen to me. Also, this happened four years ago when I was 11 years old. I’m scared no one will side with me and my mom and her husband will send me back to my country or do something bad to me. I told my friend if i should tell anyone but he said i should wait till im 18 (im 16 right now). Do you guys have any suggestions of what I should do? \n\nP.S: Sorry for the bad explanation, English isn’t my first language and this was rushed.

He turned, made eye contact with me, hugged me (or as much of me as he could reach from his height) and started crying. Long story short, I ended up on the floor right along with him, holding him and bawling my eyes out. \n\nThis one lady walks by, looks at me, and says, \"What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you trying to accomplish?

I was originally put on an SSRI (Paxil) when I was 10 for anxiety and panic attacks. I'm currently on medications and in therapy.\nBoth my parents have seen my mental illnesses impact my life and evolve. \n\n**I remembered I got molested from ages 9-11 by my best friend's dad when I was around 21. He did horrible things to all of us. After remembering, I lost it. I became suicidal, it triggered my bipolar tendencies, it was bad. My mom convinced me to break up with my bf (same man I'm seeing now) and move down to Florida to get some \"help\". I went to the psych ward a few times because of them but they didn't help. They actually kicked me out because \"I got a staph infection\"... \n\nNO! My cousin raped me in my sleep shortly after moving down there. I had my sleep apnea face mask on. I couldn't consent. I just woke up and he was inside me. That's rape, right? \n\nEvery time I bring up the fact that they still talk to and hang out with him they get really defensive. My mom blames me for what happened because \"I should've known better than to spend the night\". She blamed my illnesses and said drugs may have been involved. I DON'T EVEN DRINK ffs! \n\nI wanted to go to the cops. My rents wouldn't let me. After me making that threat I was no longer allowed at family functions. My dad even forbid me from going to my grandmother's funeral 😔 \n\nI eventually got worse and worse. I was always in hysterics; constantly crying. I would call my mom when that happened because, well, she's my mom. One day she said to me, \"I went to the doctor and he said if I keep talking to you like this I'm going to have a heart attack and die and I'm not willing to die for you.\" So, I backed waaaaaay off. Eventually, being unmedicated was too much for me and I couldn't work. I got evicted. \n\nI HAD TO SLEEP IN MY CAR! SO DANGEROUS FOR A WOMAN IN FLORIDA! THEY DIDN'T CARE! Then I had to move in with an autistic man with mental illnesses who forced me to do sexual stuff for my medications. I couldn't take it anymore and caved, called my parents and asked if they could put me up in a hotel (they're loaded and have no shortage of cash). I had just filed charges for sexual battery and had nowhere to go. I was surprised that they gave me any money at all. They were convinced I was on drugs and basically disowned me for a few years. I wasn't on drugs. I was undiagnosed and unmedicated bipolar. \n\nWas I even raped?! \nHow do I stand up to my parents and tell them how much this hurt/hurts me? That I felt so abandoned, scared, and alone... I feel so betrayed. \n",

However, having to deal with the trauma itself, while being forced by survival (here in America) to continue to work while recovering from the trauma with no available rest (mental/medical) period, and not having emotional sense of survival security due to finances has caused checking the mail to become triggering on its own.\n\nI'm hoping to spread awareness that yes, common \"minor\" \"necessities for survival\" can put additional mental burdens on people who are already struggling, so it's not okay to blame people for not being able to excel like people without the invisible burden of ptsd. It's wrong to blame people for seeming to just not be able to \"get it together\".\n\nThe most cruel industries in their marketing for this definitely includes the beauty industry and wellness industries, which thrive on stoking emotions on fears of appearance-based inadequacy.

They clearly did not like working with students and did not want me there, but I needed them to teach me/reinforce certain skills to pass the internship, and I confronted them firmly but in as professional terms I could about it. It only made things worse. By their own admission, I was not the first student they had problems with.\n\nSoon after, a piece of my personal property went missing, which I figured was coincidence, but then another one was tampered with. I finally reported the situation to my university. Again, this only made things more tense, and I was getting into conflicts with this supervisor multiple times a day every day.\n\nEventually, I was accused of cheating on a certain task. I don't know whether it was a deliberate setup or a mere coincidence with how that happened, but regardless, the site reported me to my university. I was absolutely terrified I was going to be kicked out of college. Had a mental breakdown as soon as I left for the day. Fortunately, to my university, the entire situation was suspicious, and I was sent to a new site to finish my internship, and had no problems there. \n\nFor awhile, I thought I'd gotten over it, until these last couple of months. I graduate in December and I am terrified of getting a job in the field I had my internship in, but it's the only thing my degree applies to. I keep getting flashbacks and having nightmares. I keep trying to reason with myself when the anxiety hits, and it works temporarily, but it always comes back. And while I'd never actually do it, I fantasize about purposefully failing this last semester so I can delay getting a job. \n\nTo boot, I did witness something very horrific at the new site I was sent to, at the fault of no one, it was just an extremely unfortunate event. I played Tetris after because I knew it might give me flashbacks and heard that may help. I haven't had any flashbacks or nightmares about that incident and I feel guilty that out of the things my brain chooses to be traumatized by, it's by someone being mean to me rather than something that actually ruined people's lives.  \n\nI just don't understand why I'm so caught up over something that ultimately worked out in my favor.

Now, I am probably on the spectrum so when I was a kid, I had a lot of sensory issues but I've worked on them and I'm doing great now. Anyway, we wrapped up trick-or-treating in our neighbourhood and headed over to my brother’s grandparents’ house so we could get candy from them. So, we get there and I rang the doorbell, and instead of someone opening the door to give us candy, they OPEN THE DOOR AND FUCKING SPRAY ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH SILLY STRING… as I said, I was a very sensitive child so I didn't take kindly to that, and that incident basically ruined Halloween for me. Since then, I have decided to skip over Halloween entirely and start the holiday season early. \n\nI don't know if this belongs here but I thought I would tell the story somewhere, and maybe someone will relate to it, who knows? Some people think it's kinda odd, or I'm rigid but whatever. I don't care for Halloween parties, I rarely ever dress up (and if I do it's a low-quality costume to fit in because I have to), but I do enjoy the cheap candy 😂. \n\nAnyway, hope you enjoy your Halloween, if you celebrate!",

Nothing for weeks. \nUsually, my GP or therapist would be in touch. \n\nAfter some time, not hearing anything further, I contact my GP. I figured they were sent a copy at least. \nThey say 'I've haven't heard of any report and it's been 6 weeks!' \n\nSo I contact the insurer requesting a copy is sent to my GP, therapist, and myself. \nThey ask who my GP and therapist are (they absolutely know who they are -they're paying games). \n\nI tell them anyway. \n\nThey respond by saying that they'll send it to my GP. \n\nThey won't send the copy to me, though. \n\nWhat's the game here?

I use the word ‘fight’ lightly because I’m not very big for my age and would never purposely get into a fist fight with anyone because it’s not who I am and I would never win.

I barely remember what it looked like and Kind of forgot I saw it so I guess my brain is pushing it away as much as it can, which I’m glad about. After that I had nervous ticks making my neck cramp up multiple times in a minute, whenever I thought of it. On that same day I tried to eat a food I enjoyed and started having these tics again, signaling me to stop eating. I ignored it, because I was hungry and was physically sick after for at least 30 minutes. This then repeated multiple times. Over the while the random tics have stopped and only joined up when I feel uncomfortable due to weird sensations or in the eating situations when it decides I should not eat anymore. Now this is really annoying, because often I barely ate a few bites and am still hungry, but know I can’t eat more or else I’ll be sick. \nNow I was wondering, is there really a connection to the two things? It definitely correlated at the start, but could it still be the same reason nowadays? I do stim after because of the uncomfortable sensation it gives and I have autism and adhd as well. It’s just really starting to get annoying ^^ could anyone try to explain this in the most rational way possible- (feel free to ask questions if necessary) ",

        "Text": "My earliest memory is from when I was around 3 or 4 years old. I can recall it as vividly as if it were yesterday, and it unsettles me. During a summer vacation with my family, I remember going to take a nap with my mother after we came back from the sea. Under the covers, I took off my clothes and remember secretly touching myself. The only thing I knew was that it wasn’t the first time I had done it. \n\nWhen I was alone at home as a child, I would sometimes undress in front of the mirror and touch myself, not even realizing it was a sexual act, because I didn’t learn what sexuality was until I started third grade. I remember feeling a particular satisfaction from doing it secretly.\n\nLater on, I discovered p0rnography, and it changed my life. The unrealistic body images and portrayals of sex gradually disconnected me from real life. Now, I hate my body and don’t have a single day where I feel adequate.\n\nFor years, every time I’m alone (even in my first job), I end up touching myself and wanting more and more. But because I hate my body, I don’t have the courage to enter into a relationship with someone else (this may be the only advantage protecting me from doing things I might regret).\n\nAt first, I thought I might be hypersexual. But it didn’t seem reasonable since it might be related to trauma. When I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at the age of 20, I started to think it could be related to that (my hypersexuality)\n\nStill, I don’t think it’s normal for a 3-4 year old to do something like this. Maybe it is, and maybe it’s something normal, but because I can’t share it with anyone, I can’t help but feel scared.\n\nLast year, my sister, who is ten years older than me, confesse.d that someone in our family abused her when she was very young. But she didn’t want to share the details or reveal who it was. This scares me even more, and I can’t help but wonder if there might be things from my childhood that I’ve forgotten.\n\nI hate discussing it with others—so much so that some people even assume I’m asexual. My family thinks I’m disgusted by sexuality and that I would never be with anyone. But I am far from being that way.\n\nI can’t share this experience with my therapists because, as I said, I hate discussing sexuality with others. \n\n\nI don’t feel very happy writing this, so I might delete it.(Apologies for any errors, I used a translation app.)",

I started to behave like a little girl, out of fear that I would hurt someone, because I heard from certain people in the past that I was terrible. I suddenly became dependent on others, I sought a lot of attention and contact from others. My psychologist said that I have an attachment disorder. Only I don't understand why this wasn't the case until I was 19, and then suddenly it was.

Crucial things that I need.\n\nAn example of that is school, ever since kindergarten I've been bullied physically, verbally, and emotionally. I've had some terrible things happen to me at school and the adults don't care so why even be there if it's gonna make me all awful? One of the worst things that happened was a kid pulling a knife on me, it was a light silver dagger with a black handle. The kid never got expelled only suspended.\n\nI will avoid the skatepark too, it's really disappointing because it's one of my favorite places, I've been physically assaulted on multiple occasions there.

When I tried to verbalize this to my stepdad, I suddenly felt hot all over. I felt choked up, like I couldn’t talk or breathe well, and my heart was pounding so hard my stepdad told me he could feel it while I sat leaning on him. \n\nMy parents had an argument sometime last year. My mom and my stepdad are happily married. He’s safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and while they wouldn’t notice, I drove to somewhere secluded and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren’t safe anymore, and I was all on my own.\n\nAre these flashbacks? I was under the impression a flashback meant a literal reexperiencing of an event, sensory-wise. Or can it also happen without recalling a specific memory? When people say they reexperience an event, do they mean externally, or in their mind’s eye? What exactly is the difference between being triggered and experiencing a flashback, and how would you go about recognizing them?",

I never really post on here, but i am so completely lost with this. things have been really bad with her and my father over the past few months. she was physically and mentally abusive most of my life and has apologized before. she has her own trauma that i sympathize with, and the other day it got to a breaking point. she sat me down and spoke with me? and i told her i was scared of her. that even as we were speaking i was afraid she’d snap (more so told her this as a precaution so she was more aware if she’d try and hit me or do something) \n\ni told her how she hurt me over the years. she said she knows and she’s sorry and didn’t truly take accountability. she kept trying to turn it on me but also weirdly accepted how she’s hurt me? she said she’s sorry for what she’s done and i think she meant it, but again, this is so confusing for me. she hasn’t hit me in years, but her mental abuse has been consistent. now she’s being really nice and still criticizing me, but i don’t think she realizes she’s criticizing. i feel she thinks she’s giving good advice. i don’t know. is my trauma supposed to be fixed now? am i supposed to feel better? i feel like im supposed to be happy now. but not sure how to feel. i don’t know how long this will last, but ive always hoped for a better relationship with her. as soon as i gave up on that, (was actually going to go no contact) she apologized, so i have no idea what to think now. i do love her and maybe this time it will be better, but i was just wondering if anyone has advice with this? \n\n(i ask that people who post on this please be nice, thank you)",

I had never considered that I might have PTSD and now I feel even more hopeless. I have been unable to overcome depression since 2017. PTSD just feels so insurmountable. I'm worried I'll be stuck like this forever and I don't think I can bare it. Since Friday, I have been feeling like I don't want to be here. Tonight I have spent the evening browsing Mind and Samaritans, googling 'feeling suicidal,' and even the risks of failure. I'm scared of dying..... But terrified of being alive. I text my friend to say that I miss her (she lives abroad) and she didn't reply. I think this has made me realise that I have no one. The PWP asked for any emergency contact and I told her I didn't have anyone, partly out of fear of her telling someone about what I shared and partly because it is true. I'm going to bed hoping I don't wake tomorrow because I don't know if I can go on like this. I want something to change but I feel stuck in time!",

I guess it's all over Facebook from page of the recorder ride was terrifying nobody called the check on me not even my come get me because it was like 10 at night 10:30 or something when the doctors called Danica came and got me with her boyfriend lacerations and bruises all over me when I was about 10 years old the whole country blue blood vessels in my left eye and I'm in so much pain I almost wish I were back at the hospital nobody took Tanner to the vet and he's just a little dude I'm letting him sleep on the bed tonight for the first time all the medical staff drama physicians and helicopter physician said if I hadn't been in the wheelchair the neighbor, and my 6 month puppy, I've had for a month, Tanner, and I would be dead right now.

POWERCHAIR destroyed. Glasses destroyed.. Fitbit destroyed. Heaeing aids destroyed.\nWe are all very much suffering. Massachusetts is state of occurrence. My parents are not showing up as parents. They didn't come down until the road when I were and I'm not a consciousness bleeding in the middle of the road. They didn't come to the hospital. They didn't call the hospital to check on me. They refuse to come get me after I was helicopter to a further hospital to the trauma unit. How it helped me with nutrition I'm stuck upstairs in the house nobody's taking care of the puppy the right way and so I'm having to push through pain and injuries just to get up and down the stairs to try to get the dog to go out. My friends are showing up and caring and checking in especially my bestie. My cat doesn't understand and I don't know if the dog does either and I don't know how the dog was. I was for sure he was a goner under my wheelchair. Somehow he got loose and ran up to the house. Maybe his Lassie moment? The impact of the crash keeps playing all over my body and over in my head and I'm unable to sleep sensibly or even without any pain like I can't get comfortable I can barely walk no broken bones and no internal bleeding but they did say I need an MRI and I have cancer and I'm a mean compromise have harassing back issues and now my sciatica areas so bad I can barely put pressure on my left my face is cut open the back of my head feels completely Bruce might have I was injured and left me as injured my left foot is injured you bruises all over me.

Is this normal and how long does it stick around? \n\nSo, I've been in therapy for 10+ years on and off, mainly crisis support and working through general mental health issues. This is the first time I'm confronting my traumas, and for context I am a CSA and child abuse survivor. \n\nI feel like I am ready, I want to be ready. I am in a safe place now, but I can't move forward without experiencing PTSD on some level daily. Hence, therapy. We have not touched anything too deeply but it's still more than I've ever talked about it outside of conversations with my partner, or drunkenly trauma dumping to someone who has similar expierences. I guess maybe the seriousness of the setting throws me off. \n\nI've only had two sessions, in fact. The dissociation feels like a lot more, but at the same time I can't remember what it's like to not have this feeling. I'm more clubsy, can't focus much... I do have other life stresses, so it might not be the therapy. Still, I'm wondering has anyone else experienced this? How long roughly did it last, or is this a sign that I need to stop? I really don't think I will get through therapy without experiencing this side of things so... Stopping doesn't feel like an option. I want this, it just kinda sucks as a side effect. ",

Problem is, we're still freshly new adults (I'm 19, my sister's 18) and know barely anything about adult stuff (never were taught how to fucking cook btw, had to do it ourselves). My mom was willing to commit a federal crime by withholding my SSN (she *eventually* gave it to me after a political event appeared but not after me finding a disability resource website and thinking about calling them to *even get it*/me telling her SO many times). My parents have also been physically abusive and emotionally abusive so I've realized for a few years that they are abusive.\n\nMy question is, is blatantly disregarding me and my sister's concerns about having access to adult stuff abusive? Her response is mostly \"do it yourself\" in a condescending tone. She never offers to help guide us along, she never sends us stuff to look at, just. Do it yourself! You're old enough to know! She also straight up forebodes my sister to learn how to drive (only \"after college\") despite being at *driving age.*\n\nI'm pretty sure this is at least somewhat controlling behavior but not too sure about \"fully abusive.\"",

His actions have caused me tremendous anguish and yet I am expected to give grace to a man who couldn't even acknowledge what he did was wrong. My family has brushed this matter under the rug but something vicious in me wants to dig that wound deep and raw, until the blood touches my elbow, I want them to see how fucked up I am because I'm drowning. I can't persue my goals because even the memory of his shadow haunts me and it's suffocating. I cannot find it within myself to forgive him yet and even if I do, he's lost his place in my life.

        "Text": "Hi everyone. First-time joiner, and a long-time PTSD have-r. TLDR: I have PTSD from childhood trauma I had as a kid from heavy bullying and other unfortunate things that happened. After having a neuro/psych evaluation recently, it's been made official that I have PTSD, along with depression, anxiety, and inattentive ADHD. The doctor who did the neuro/psych evaluation recommended a local facility down the street and I made an appointment with a specific therapist since he was the soonest available one.\n\nHere's where the potential red flags come into play:\n\n* I came in, no one was at the front desk, so I sat down and waited. A few minutes passed by and he came out of his office room (he wasn't seeing anyone). He was a little late but I disregarded it.\n* I finally came into the room, and it seemed he wasn't prepared for my situation, so he had to log on to his work laptop, skim through my intake forms (didn't know about my neuro/psych report I sent the facility). And he finally sat down on his therapist chair. Not sure if it's just me, but if I were a therapist, I'd certainly want to prepare myself and read through forms/reports from my patient to know the situation at hand.\n* He began asking me questions in typical therapist fashion which I welcome, but the kicker here is that I saw him almost nodding each time I would answer the questions! I think he also noticed that I noticed that he was fighting from falling asleep, but that's definitely not something I wanted to happen, intro meeting or not.\n\nI scheduled an appointment to begin EMDR therapy next week with him, and I mentioned this to my wife and she said I should call to be changed to another therapist. I thought maybe I should give him one shot since he may not be a coffee drinker or something, but that's a little wild to me. I feel like I should switch to someone else, but I'm curious what your opinion is on the matter.\n\nThanks for your input in advance! I wish everyone the best of luck in your healing journey. 💜\n\n\nEdit: I called this morning and asked to be switched to someone else. 😄 Thanks again to everyone that had commented and shared your journey with me and the community ❤️",

My instructor insists I shouldn’t quit because she believes I can overcome this fear, but I’m starting to have my doubts.\n\nAt this point, it’s a battle just to go to each lesson (I find myself wishing the train would be delayed or hoping I’ll feel sick so I don’t have to go).

I don't know what to do genuinely I am at a loss and feel like the universe is playing a cruel trick on me. During the last year of college, my Psychiatrist and therapist were making good progress, and around the end, my psych believed I had CPTSD unfortunately I changed insurance and was unable to fully address it. Since then I've moved back home and live in what feels like a house full of landmines.. It's horrible, I can't fully remember what happened to me but my childhood home and someone who lives in the house triggers these episodes constantly. I felt so much rage and fear for this entire summer, and I couldn't understand why. I am not a suicidal person but since moving back home and having episodes of this intensity I say things and do things completely out of character. I don't want to hurt myself or anything like that, but when they happen I am so scared. I have my first therapist appointment on new insurance, but I don't know if it'll help. I tried two different SSRIs and they made me feel worse. \n\nOne thing that is really bothering me is that two people really close to me are taking SSRIs and they are helping them and every time I try and medicate myself it doesn't work or makes it worse. In fact, they are both taking the SSRIs I tried.  (one has major depression and the other has GAD). I am jealous of them. I am in pain and it feels like there's no way out. I have to be here and I can't get out. \n\nI try to be regimented, workout, self-care, job, etc. but I'm losing my battles lately. The only thing that I feel will \"fix\" me is moving out. Believe me, I've tried but I can't afford it. I am fighting as hard as I can to move out but nothing is working. I am not sure what to do, I am trying to tolerate things till the therapist's appointment.  I really did not belive that I had CPTSD, but after what has been happening to me I can't deny it. I am also horrified that I am this messed up, I dont feel like I deserve any compassion at all for how I behave. It is terrifying to me and the people who love me. I am scared to hurt them. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it.",

I wasn’t able to submit my master’s thesis, and now, four years later, I’m feeling determined to finish because I’m so close. However, my diagnosis leaves me unsure about whether I can manage to complete it.\n\nI received the CPTSD diagnosis after I initially failed my thesis. To apply for accommodations, I need to describe how my CPTSD affects my studies. I’m looking for specific exceptions, like extended deadlines, more time, or flexibility on the number of attempts.\n\nFor me, making decisions, staying focused, and finishing tasks has always been difficult. When I study, I often feel lost—especially since I work alone and lack structure in my life—which can lead to dissociation and anxiety. I get overwhelmed easily, and deadlines now feel nearly impossible to meet.\n\nHas anyone here with PTSD or CPTSD received accommodations at university? How does your diagnosis affect your studies, and are there strategies or resources that have helped you?\n\nThanks so much for any advice or shared experiences.",

But this is going to be graphic so please, only read if you're 18+ and if you are able to hear this stuff (domestic violence, SA, suicidal feelings, etc). Thanks...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nSo, I'm broken. I'm completely and utterly broken. All my life I've been used, abused, and hurt. It started when I was molested. I guess it turned on a light switch in my mind and made me both incredibly sadistic and incredibly masochistic at the same time. I was also hit two times as a kid and exposed to a lot of frightening situations. The damage was done fast. Fast forward to teenagehood and then I become hypersexual and start engaging in dangerous online behavior with older men. I wanted to replay the chaos I experienced as a child. And I developed severe mental health issues like BPD and major depression...I became hypersexual and I fell fast. I became suicidal and was hospitalized.\n\nIn my late teens, I was sexually assaulted violently by my ex. It was the first violent struggle of my life. I screamed and I kicked and I fought but to no avail. Nobody could help me.  I felt disgusting in my body. I felt violated and horrible. I fell into a deep depression.\n\nThen I ended up in an abusive relationship..He called me names, so many names. And he beat me until my whole legs were covered with thick, dark bruises. I feel a sense of fear when I hear the sound of the belt. Nothing hurt more than the searing pain of the leather against my skin. It felt like it was being burned off. He also forced me to be a camgirl for money. I hated it. I tried, even on cam, and no one cared. There's still pictures of it online. If I didn't do the cam work, I would be beaten or called names. I felt like I couldn't leabe him...\n\nBut I did..\n\nOnly to fall into the hands of another abuser. He was mostly verbally abusive, but he coerced me by guilt tripping me into sex. He lamented that I didn't want to have sex with him, and he would cry. We got in an argument and I capitulated. I had sex with him and I grinned and beared it. I winced in pain and I felt beyond violated with what was happening to me. He knew I didn't want it..but he didn't stop. I left him...but it hurt. He was the last person I was with (in person) \n\nI tried to have normal relationships, but it's never worked out. The only people who want me are abusers. I feel broken, unable to escape from the cycle of abusive that I both love (because trauma feels safe) and hate (because I feel suicidal). I want to end my life because I don't want to be broken.\n\nI don't want to fall into the hands of another abuser but that seems to be my whole life. I've forgiven everyone who hurt me and I wish them peace and good things but it hurts being broken. I'm so hypersexual that I spend several hours a day in fantasy, mostly very violent ones, and not taking care of myself. \n\nIt hurts so much. \n\nI can't take this. I can't stop blaming myself. I feel like I deserve it \n\nHelp me...please....I'm drowning. ",

In the last couple of years, I've made some progress and have been working hard in therapy to get through the trauma and it's been working a little.  I'm coming out of my shell a bit more lately and socializing more than ever, which has been nice.  But it's still a daily struggle.\n\nI went to a halloweekend party at a friend's house with my partner and my friend R on Saturday night.  We had all been drinking, but I certainly wasn't expecting to get hammered, I just wanted to have some fun.  Another friend made some sangria for everyone, which was wayyyy stronger than anyone realized, including me.  I had 3(!) cups of it within the span of maybe 45 minutes and before I even realized it, I was incredibly drunk.  I remember standing on the porch with a piece of pizza and then nothing, just little flashes here and there.  I like to drink but the last time I got this drunk was when I was assaulted, so I'm not used to it.\n\nWell, while I was blacked out, I guess that was a massive trigger to my body and I apparently had a MASSIVE ptsd episode.  According to my partner and friends, I passed out, then woke up on the couch and started freaking the fuck out.  My friend R was trying to console me while my partner called an uber and they took me home, where I apparently started full on screaming when they tried to touch me to help me up after falling (multiple times) or to take my shoes off or anything.  I woke up with absolutely no memory of this, just a horrible hangover, a banged up body, and the post-adrenaline exhaustion.\n\nOn top of this, someone at the party texted my partner privately.  She was asking my partner if my friend R \"kissing\" me while I was passed out was consensual or something she should tell me about.  My wife assured her that there were no kisses at all and that it was just the way he was angled, he was just trying to calm me down and reassure me everything was okay, and that he would never do something like that.  I believe my partner, I think, but Jesus Christ.  I have not been able to relax since any of this happened.  Idk if it's just the kind of emotional hangover from having such a massive episode or if it's me trying to work out how I feel about whatever happened with my friend R.  He was, according to my partner, incredibly good with helping me when we got home and did a lot to respect my boundaries in that state while also trying to help me feel better.  But the doubt that lingers is so incredibly hard to get over.\n\nAll this to say I will never trust my friends sangria again, I hate parties and I hate PTSD. ",

I don’t know if I was very dissociatied after, but I was conscious for 1 second before I was dissociated again. From what I was told it was 30 minutes- 1 hour until I was found( my teacher thought I went down to the office, so that why it her so long to find me) from what I was told that i took me an hour to get out of dissociation and talking.

No friends beyond normal people who actually like me (I like them too) but I feel this gulf between me and all of them. They talk so easily of friends and family, tell stories about themselves as kids that don’t horrify others, and it’s not their fault. No one is to blame. Not my mom or dad or abusers. No one. These things happened to me for no reason and I bear scars I’ve never seen anywhere else. It’s too late for lifelong friendships and I guess I’m okay with that. I guess I’m okay never knowing how it feels to be loved by a family bc I’m a genetic part of it. I guess I’m okay in general now. I just feel so alone. \n\nI’m down today. You’re down tomorrow and I’m up. Everything is temporary. I have people around me at least, even if they don’t understand me at all.

I was misdiagnosed for so many years and the painfully vivid memories where it’s like I’m back in that moment are driving me insane. I don’t know if it’s normal to feel so crazy about the memories and being back in those moments but I just can’t seem to come back to the present moment as easily as I once did. \n\nThere’s been a very specific memory that has been plaguing me for years which seems perfectly happy, probably the only one that is a “nice” memory. For some reason, however, I can’t help but feel extremely on edge and uneasy whenever this specific memory comes up. I can’t tell you how or why but something feels unsafe about it. As soon as I think about it I’m fidgety and start scratching at my arms and hands. \n\nHow can I get my mind off of it or any ways to help get me out of the cycle of reliving memories that just end up making me feel scared or worse?",

        "Text": "**WARNING: THIS IS A LONG POST**\n\nI grew up in a cult and have severe c-ptsd.\n\nMy childhood was full of physical violence, emotional abuse and gaslighting. Somehow, I still managed to finish both high school and college, got a job and moved away from home. I'm 25 y/o now.\n\nI was always top of my class (an overachiever), but gave very little attention to my appearance (I had severe acne for 10+ years and just stopped trying to cover it up at some point). After college, I got rid of my acne and started putting effort into my appearance, but did it more to fit in than from genuine self-love.\n\nWhen I was 24 'the year of doom' happened. I thought I had finally become a functioning member of society, but it turned out that I had gotten myself into three very bad relationships/situations:\n\n\\- I became best friends with the most unhinged woman I had ever met (but she hid her true self very well).\n\n\\- I was in my (second) romantic relationship with a man who mistreated me. (Hid his phone, talked with past flings, almost never did anything nice, let his friends disrespect me, constantly played me songs about men cheating on their girlfriends... But was the sweetest ray of sunshine when we had first met.)\n\n\\- I ended up working a job where the boss was a wuss and allowed my co-worker to put me down repeatedly. (And would then get extremely offended once I had decided to quit after a year.) They have had a problem with this particular individual for years (many people have quit because of her attitude, some even after a few days of being there), but have not fired her, as she knows more about the business than the boss himself.\n\nAfter the incident with the 'best friend', though, I went through an episode of rage and self-hatred. I had first tried to commit suicide before I even started attending elementary school and was luckily unsuccessful. Then that need subsided. Until that 'year'. After that I tried again. **I'm absolutely not trying to say it was her 'fault' specifically, there were just too many things going wrong at the same time and this was just the proverbial 'cherry on top'. Had it not been this situation, it could have been anything else...**\n\n**If you're interested, keep reading. Otherwise, please click away.**\n\n**Here's the story (hopefully short enough without losing context):**\n\nI had met my best friend in college. We were acquaintances for a long time, but became very close in the year after I finished school as she had kept inviting me out to events. She was the sweetest person ever. She not only introduced me to her entire friend circle, her fiancee, but to her entire family as well. In the entire year from the moment we started hanging out until her wedding she had NOT ONCE done ANYTHING that would rise suspicion. I did notice a possible mean streak once or twice, but we all slip up sometimes, so I just brushed it off.\n\nI had never had a close friend, only people I went out to lunch with. The cult had taught me that hanging out with people outside our religion would take me away from God. By the time I met her, I had been an atheist for a few years already. But I knew that I had a problem with being too trusting. I kept my walls up with her and didn't wanna let her in too easily. I didn't overshare. I didn't self-deprecate. I just was. I thought I did everything 'right'. But she still turned around and hurt me once I had finally let her in. I think this is why I got so pissed afterwards.\n\nSo, after the 'honeymoon' year we had, she got married to her fiancee. She asked me to be her maid of honour. I was ECSTATIC as I truly loved her as a friend. I also felt proud of myself as I interpreted her request as me 'having made it' as a member of broader society. I was finally 'normal'. And despite my shitty relationship and job, I still had my wonderful friend who would always be there for me. She had at one point even said to me that 'she would always protect me and love me and that I was her soulmate'.\n\nSo yeah. Some time after the marriage, I'd finally had it with my boyfriend and I dumped him. I wish I had done so sooner, but he was my first 'real' relationship. (My first boyfriend had a severe porn addiction and had consequently become impotent because of it, which made the relationship very... hard to sustain.) She flipped completely once I was single - which was weird because I was also single when we first became friends. After the breakup she wanted to meet up with me to 'offer me a shoulder to cry on', but then just interrogated me the whole time.\n\nWhat happened next all went down in a span of two months. She couldn't stop talking about different men lusting after her (her professor, acquaintances, random men on the street). When we were alone, she suddenly started acting as though she was single, always checking who was looking at her and twirling her hair. She also started making small, hurtful jabs at me and came up with very creative backhanded compliments. She implied that my ex-boyfriend secretly liked her, continuously repeated that 'it was obvious that my ex never loved me', tried to set me up with men she knew secretly had a thing for her, even tried to invite herself to a blind date her husband tried to arrange for me. She obsessed over how 'good' or 'bad' the guys I was getting to know were (i.e. their physical appearance, job etc - she wanted to know everything). She then even started insulting the size of my breasts. I had, understandably, decided to cut her off.\n\nHowever, my new boyfriend (who she didn't know about for a long time) told me to talk it out with her like an adult and I agreed as I thought that I had nothing to lose. People close to me also told me that people sometimes have a crisis after they get married (especially if they get married young - she was just 22 y/o) and that she would probably get over it. I also didn't want to lose a (previously very good) friend if there was still a chance to mend things. Well, the talk did not go well. She was incredibly gracious at the time but (of course) deflected everything. Good old gaslighting. Then she became very cold towards me, but only when she knew we were alone/when we talked on the phone.\n\nSoon after she and I had the 'talk', I had naively decided to give her a second chance and agreed to let her and her husband meet my new boyfriend. I suppose she really wanted to meet him as she had still been relatively nice up until the meeting. During the meeting she talked with a cutesy high-pitched voice and flirted with my boyfriend (in front of her husband) so aggressively that he had concluded by the end of the evening that the two were in an open marriage. At some point that evening the two of us were alone (the guys had left to get us something to eat) and she posed inappropriate questions about me and my new boyfriend's sex life. After I had diplomatically answered them she got annoyed and said that her boyfriend has an enormous penis and that she orgasms 6 to 7 times per round. She then clarified that she only told me that so that I 'would have realistic expectations for my sex life'. Talk about insecure.\n\nAfter that meeting, I avoided her like the plague, deleted all my social media and decided to try and fade out of her life. I didn't want to make a dramatic exit, as I suspected that she may be a very vengeful person. But I had promised a mutual friend that I would come to a very casual birthday celebration of hers a month prior and I did not want to go back on my word. However, once I got there, the two women did a weird spiel talking about my boyfriend without letting me interject. I suspect they had made plans to do so beforehand, but even if they hadn't... my 'best friend' went 'off-script' either way. She literally couldn't hold herself back and said that my new boyfriend had a 'small dick'. The only person who even remotely tried to stand up for me was her husband. I stood up and left and blocked all of them immediately.\n\nI thought that was the end, but two weeks later she suddenly started calling me from random numbers at ungodly times. I knew it was her, because who else would call at 8 AM on a weekday or on a weekend afternoon and then not leave a message if it was so important. But one fateful Sunday, my boyfriend picked up my phone, because he believes in always answering the phone no matter what. He didn't even recognize her by her voice but she immediately went and slid into his DMs after I had blocked that number too. In the DM she accused me of 'having used her for friendship until I got a boyfriend' and of me hurting her so severely that she NEVER wanted to have ANY kind of relationship with me ever again, but she reportedly still wanted to know 'why I had abandoned her'.\n\nHe poignantly told her that he was surprised that she had the guts to say that I was the bad friend and even more guts for writing to him after what she had said about his penis. She then started profusely 'apologizing' while also hammering home the point that I was the one who had 'misunderstood' her comment. But once he refused her proposition of another meeting, she flipped the script and said that she had actually never said that his penis was small and that I was the worst person she had ever met. That I would leave him too one day and that he would be sorry that he did not heed her warning.\n\nMy boyfriend then told me to maybe write to her one last time - to close the chapter, not for any other reason and I decided to do so. I tersely summarized the worst things she had said/done to me, but said that I still wish her all the best in her life. I also asked her to never contact me or my loved ones ever again. The reply I got was the most disgusting and hurtful attack on my being I had ever experienced. She said I am so rotten that she did not wish me well by any means. That I am 'intellectually impaired' for not understanding the things she had said and that she had NEVER insulted me once. She also got indignant as I had written in my message that I would rather have no friends than abusive ones and she tired her best to insult my very ability to be a good friend to anyone... I don't care to go back and re-read exactly what she had written, because I had managed to forget some of it and will hopefully someday forget it all.\n\nThat was the end of the 'fairytale' friendship. After a year of love bombing, the relationship was irreparably destroyed in two months. However, she has kept the social media post she had once made for my birthday on Instagram and Facebook, acting as though we had never fallen out. In that post she, ironically, calls me 'the best person in the world'.\n\n**Fin.**\n\n**I hope that, perhaps, this story will help someone who has gone/is going through something similar. That was my intention when I had first posted it on Reddit, but it got so bombarded by negative comments that I removed it for my own peace of mind. I am currently working through my trauma in therapy, have had heart-to-hearts with my relatives and I'm working hard to become the cycle-breaker in my family.**\n\n**For everyone who is going through the notorious side-effects of (C-)PTSD, know that you are ENOUGH. We may be very attractive to abusers but the more we stand our ground, the further we will have made it in our journey. Believe in yourselves, respect yourselves and (most of all) be gentle to yourselves. I too suffer from constant re-counting of unpleasant events, rumination, over-explaining and hyper vigilance. But try my best to forgive myself - as should you. We are as we are and we are enough.**\n\n**Wish you all the best in your lives. Love yourselves! :)**",

But, I'm still a wreck. \n\nI've really tried to simplify my regimen but even with therapy I don't feel comfortable decreasing any meds at this time. I HATE that I'm so dependent on them! I'm basically addicted to Clonazepam now. I've never abused it but I've been on it for 10 years and when I don't take it I can DEFINITELY tell. I'm so frustrated 😞 there have been times when I couldn't afford my meds and I had scary, awful withdrawals. I'm officially an addict.\n\nI can't even get pregnant right now because I'd have to come off my meds and there's just no way. I'm seriously dependent on these psych drugs/benzo and I hate it. I'm worried I'm going to develop dementia early because of this. I HATE PSYCH PILLS! \n\nI feel so awful about myself and paranoid. ",

No one else steps in, I get a few hours off a few days a week with prepping before hand (making meals that morning for when I’ll be gone that day) and it’s just so fucking tiring. All day untill she decides to go to bed and I only get paid 69 hours worth of it for each month, . Honestly I’m starting to dissociate and can’t even entirely remember what I was going on about in particular I mean I know but I don’t know why I was talking about that in specific. I still need to make breakfast. I’m just so tired. I’m just so so tired. It’s hard to have ptsd. I wish people understood it’s not just from war. \n",

        "Upvotes": 11,
        "Text": "It's difficult to start this off without sounding outlandish or weird but the impacts of this repressed memory coming back after waking from general anesthesia has completely altered my reality. It's been difficult to discuss openly since nobody has openly expressed something happening like this. I've generally been known as an engima in the health field but I feel so alone in all of this and a part of me is in continuous denial. This memory was something completely random as I was never aware of having being SAed. I've had my suspicions based off certain elements such having a weird anxiety when people go near my back area. So I was completely put off guard with this new found information.\n\nTo give some context without being too personal, I am a 22/F was having a procedure called a cystocopy conducted that involves the inseration of a small tube up urethra in order to examine the bladder. Due to the invasive nature of this surgery the doctor had decided to put me to sleep while doing the procedure. As someone who's done a few other procedures in the past, I've never had any issues with general anesthesia and wake up from it in a great mood. These other surgeries were not in the private areas however, which I believe may provide some additional context. \n\nAfter the surgery was conducted, I had woken up, felt the pain in the gential area and instantly had a memory of being being violently SAed. It was a very quick glimpse of this memory before my brain shut it down as quickly as it appeared (I saw a quick glimpse before It was instantly hidden). Now....while feeling the pain of the procedure and having the memory occur, a series of other physical stimulus started to occur which sent me spiraling all in the matter of seconds.\n\n I want to make a note that when I look back to this occurrence it felt as though every response was subconscious.\n\nAnyways, after feeling the pain, seeing the memory, I noticed I was unclothed and the thought of \"not again, not again, not again\" was surging through my head. Then I noticed the liquid that was all over my body (water from cleaning) I remember saying \"who did this to me?!?!\" And proceeded to look down to see my thighs covered in yellow stains (numbing agent) thinking I had been marked from the assault. Essentially I was reliving and feeling everything that had happened to me within the memory.\n\nAfter all of these things had occurred (which all happened in a matter of less than 2 minutes) I tried to physically remove myself from the bed and head to the bathroom. A part of me was trying to flee (fight or flight) and the thought was I was now tampered with and needed to clean myself in order to purify. As I gripped the handles, while swinging side to side because I was still high, a nurse ran over to me confused as to why I was trying to get out of my bed. I was of course silent and told the nurse repeatedly \"I NEED TO GO TO THE WASHROOM.\" The nurse sadly was dismissive of my request and tried to make me urinate in a pan. I kept repeating to her that I needed to go to the bathroom, in which she reluctantly had moved the bed and navigated me in front of the washroom, where I proceeded to continue with my inner turmoil. \n\nIThese emotions and the reliving of this trauma was ongoing for over 3 hours.I ended up shaking/trembling subconsciously the entire time. I didn't know it was that long until I was notified by the nurse in the ER I was in recovery for that long. I even remember the doctor trying to speak to me but I was unresponsive and another nurse coming up to me to ask if I was alright since I was in COMPLETE distress. It has been impacting my ability to live and my therapist believes I've developed severe PTSD since it completely altered all elements of my life. I am recovering slightly but the constant thought of it being a fake memory plagues me and the constant anxiety formulated after experiencing this has impacted my ability to function. I don't know what to do but I just don't want to feel alone anymore. It's hard to discuss since nobody understands it so I decided to turn here. Any thoughts are welcome.",

Long story short police were involved and they never found out if anything actually did happen to me because I was so young and wouldn’t talk about it. I still don’t know if anything happened to me, and so I don’t know if I’m just overreacting. My therapist said it doesn’t matter if the flashbacks are real or not, the fact is I’m having intense reactions to them, and to deal with how to cope. I reiterated this to my mum, who then told me that because she was an adult during the time and remembered it all that I can come to her with these flashbacks (and she doesn’t mind if they’re really uncomfortable to talk about) and she can say whether it happened to me or not. I find this weird, as one of the reasons she started drinking for most of my life is that for 4 years she never knew what was happening to my sister at the time, and so she blamed herself for it. I find it a bit rich that she now knows everything and can discern whether something happened to me or not. Anyway I dunno I might be overreacting, I know she meant well…\n\n",

Just lost my job due to restructuring and I am stressed as hell, but my mothers gone and my dad on his way out, I have a 14 year old sister. ( all this just for context ) \n\nBut space created room for our relationship to be okayish with me and my dad, unfortunately memories resurfaced recently that has made that allot harder. My whole life I have been invalidated in my feelings being told it was just discipline and I was a difficult child, he has never apologized seriously always in a manner in which he truly doesn't care. I've got PTSD and BPD diagnosed at the current moment with the additional depression and anxiety mixed in.\n\nNow to get to tonight:\n\nEssentially I get a call from him typically an every 2 week event and he starts speaking on mental health as he has recently gone through a near death experience and (he is also now super religious)  suddenly believes you can have mental health problems, he speaks on how my mother gave me mine and I correct him saying that both were very much involved. He then switches to how its my fault that I turned out how I did, that I feel angry all the time and am not exactly a joy to be around 24/7. He then asks for examples I give them, things like how he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me against the wall and screamed in my face while I complained I could not breathe, or him attempting to break my arm because he felt disrespected (in front of family members who are apart of this cutoff) Or him kicking down my door because he was angry at me and couldn't open it correctly thinking it was locked.\n\nAt this point he began to say he has no regrets and is done apologizing for the past, I mentioned he never apologized seriously once. (Not sure it would matter tbh) He claimed it was discipline and mentioned I was a smartass and difficult child, I then brought up my sister whom has not had to experience this at more than 30% to my knowledge, and she is just like me because she spent most of the time with me, he claimed its different (thank god it is because if she had to suffer as well I'd have lost it).\n\nBut then after I said ask anyone outside the family what it sounds like to them and see what they say, at that point he said I am done with this you can choose to make yourself suffer have a goodnight.\n\nNot my finest moment I just said \"get cancer\" and hung up.\n\nAt this point I've begun separating myself from social media with them and cutting off all lines of communication with that side other than my sister who completely understands why I am doing this.\n\nI cut off my mom as a child and it was easy, haunted me later on like years later. But why does cutting him off feel so wrong like I am making a mistake even though all he brings me is anger every time he talks to me he says he is gonna die with no regrets, which I know its wrong but it irks the hell out of me.\n\nI haven't ever felt validated or like what I went through was truly as bad as it felt, every day walking on thin ice hoping to not piss him off for something so small. I still to this moment am wondering if I did the right thing and don't know where to go from here, what if they try to contact me? What if he does end up passing? Do I show up for my sister or save my mental? \n\nMay not be the place for it but I am struggling I am not gonna lie, I cannot see a therapist till the 7th and I only get 12 free sessions and now that I have been termed a week before I got benefits I don't know what to do.\n\nDon't really know if I am venting or asking for advice I am just so tired, this week has been hell for me.\n\nThanks for any comment given.",

        "Text": "I live in Israel (let’s keep it civil please, I’m an individual and a human being and shouldn’t be held accountable for the actions of my government) and I’m having a really hard time. \n\nEven though I live in the center, and not up north where there’s alot of drama, I am under tremendous stress at all times. When I’m at home, I have to have suitable clothing on so if there’s an air raid siren I can run to the neighborhood shelter at a moment’s notice. I have a go bag for my boyfriend and I, waiting under our bed to be taken with us to the shelter, and we’ve had to bring it with us many times, without knowing if we’d ever see our home again. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where we don’t bring the go bag with us to the shelter or even leave our house for every air raid siren. Via our emergency notification system, we can see if what’s coming is a hostile aircraft, or missiles, and we can act accordingly. We only really go to the shelter when we’re told to stay in a safe place until “further notice” like during the second ballistic missile attack from Iran a few weeks ago… \n\n\n\nThere are a few stand out moments that I still have flashbacks of: Last winter there was a terror attack in my city, I was home alone and I ran out of my house to lock my gate, and bolt my windows. I turned off all the lights in the house and hid under my bed as terrorists stabbing people and running people over were literally on the street outside of my house. I called my parents who were outside of Israel for a trip at the time, and I spoke to them for what I thought could be the last time. \n\nAs I mentioned previously, a few weeks ago there was a large scale ballistic missile attack from Iran, and I really struggled. The whole day things were tense and we were hearing rumors. My boyfriend and I were in the park with our dog when we heard explosions in the distance, which is not abnormal, but added to our growing fear. We then got word that the IDF has told all citizens to stay “close” to a shelter until further notice, and so we went home and waited. Just when I started dinner, our phones went off with emergency notifications that we had never seen before. Usually it’s something like: “Missile Attack. Head to safe room and stay there for 10 minutes” it takes 10 minutes for all the shrapnel from the missiles destroyed by the iron dome to fall, and to protect people from the shrapnel, they recommend staying in a shelter for that amount of time. But this time they didn’t tell us what was happening, just to go to a shelter immediately and stay until further notice. We grabbed our dog and our bag and went to the shelter. There were no air raid sirens, but we could see our neighbors heading to the shelter as well, carrying their guns, herding their kids and dogs down into the shelter. I tried to call my family who live on the other side of town, but the phone lines were down completely, and that’s when I started to have a panic attack. We sat on the floor in the corner of the shelter and I laid my head in my boyfriend’s lap and felt the walls shake with explosions. I didn’t know what was an interception and what was a fallen missile. I didn’t know if we would come out of the shelter in a few hours and see a wasteland, or if we would ever come out at all. Later my parents showed me a video they took of two missiles landing simultaneously a few kilometers away, and I watch the video on repeat now, I don’t know why, maybe to torture myself? \n\nThere are air raid sirens more and more often lately, I’m a nanny and I can’t take my babies out of the neighborhood anymore; I used to take them to the library, the pool, the park… Now with every step I take while pushing the stroller, I tell myself “That’s the building I’ll run to if there’s an air raid siren” and before I even pass said building, I’m already looking for another one that will be a better option for when I pass it. I don’t put the shoulder straps on my baby so if I need to grab her quickly, I can just slide her out from the hip straps and not have to fumble with buttons. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were going to visit some friends in Tel Aviv, I went to put on heels and I looked at my feet, realizing that if there was a siren or a terror attack, which are becoming common in Tel Aviv lately (I was at the scene of a shooting a few years ago in Tel Aviv, before the war) I wouldn’t be able to run and I might fall, which could cost me my life. \n\nMy heart sinks and my ankles feel weak when I hear a loud motorcycle, when a car slows down beside me, when I’m home alone… I get so afraid to take a shower in case there’s a siren and I can’t get dressed fast enough. \n\nThe way I plan my life, the first thoughts that come into my head when someone walks close to me on the street, when I have to take the bus, when I hear a loud noise, when I wake up and I’m not sure where I am, show me that I’m not the same person I thought I was when the war started. I live in flight or fight mode all the time, and I’m scared that if I survive this, and everything goes back to “normal” I’ll be forever afraid. \n\n",

        "Text": "Trigger warning : assault, death, loss\n\nMy boyfriend was killed in our home 2 months ago.\n\nThe day before his family came over for a drink. It was out of the blue, drugs were involved. It was the 2nd time his family ever came to visit us in the 3 months we lived together. We had been in a relationship for 6 months and knew each other for 8 months. The day before he was killed, we planned to have a drink just the 2 of us, as I mentioned his family came over unexpectedly. His sisters, his brother and his mom. We were having a drink and I ordered for some more. I didn’t want to share theirs so I decided I would stop drinking around 11pm maybe 12am and wait for the alcohol I ordered. It never arrived. When I stopped drinking, I went downstairs to sleep with my children. At some point around 4 or 5 his mother came downstairs and threatened to kill me and my children, that she was gonna comeback and burn our home down. So I called my boyfriend on his cellphone, from downstairs to where he was upstairs. I cried to him and told him what his mom just said. (Apparently she says things like that alot when drinking). He came to comfort me and one of his sister came downstairs as well to reassure me. They told me they wouldn’t let anything happen to us. They went back upstairs to continue to drink. Shortly after, I heard some noise coming from upstairs. I thought they would settle it on their own. But it kept going, so I went upstairs to check what was going on. 3 of his sisters were attacking him and he was fighting as hard as he could back. He was outnumbered. I saw one of his sisters pull out a knife and she began stabbing him. I couldn’t stop it and it all happened so fast. His chest was covered in blood. There was blood all over the walls and our bed. They finally stopped attacking him and on the way out, they warned me not to call the cops. But as soon as they walked out of the house, I locked it and called the ambulance. I was scared to call the cops. And I also didn’t know how serious his wounds were. I told him I’m going to call 911 and he agreed. That’s the last time I heard him say anything. 911 operator told me how to help him, to put pressure on his wounds but there were so many. The shirt I used filled with blood, his shirt filled with blood. The operator told me the ambulance was outside but when I went to check, they were treating his sister for a less serious wound. She stole his ambulance. It took the operator and the paramedics 10 minutes to work it out that she wasn’t the victim that needed help. 10 minutes was a lot while he was bleeding and in pain. His blood was filling his lungs, which I didn’t know at the time. I found out later when he passed away at the hospital. In between all that time, I had no idea when his other siblings and mother left. Or how the fight even started. All I knew is he fought for his life til the very end and he protected me and my babies. Our babies, he called them and raised them as his own. After the ambulance finally showed up to help, they began working on him, while I had to make sure the children were okay. The police showed up and the girls tried to frame me so I was detained. I was put in handcuffs and had to sit in the back of the cop truck while my boyfriend was dying and our kids were downstairs alone. What a nightmare. They asked me what happened and I told them my point of view. They handcuffed his 3 sisters and put the killer in the back seat with me. They let me out and uncuffed me. I was able to go back inside to try to be by his side without getting in the way. Eventually they stabilized him enough to transport him to the hospital. He later died, not enough oxygen to his brain and his heart couldn’t handle it anymore. I went to tell his family and from there everything felt so unreal. I got to be part of the planning of his services. For which I’m grateful. 2 of his sisters were charged with manslaughter and 1 with murder. The 2 were released and the 1 is currently still in jail. A week after he passed away, the day of his funeral it all hit me. But I still felt numb. I felt numb for a week and a half and then the anxiety came. It felt like I was going to die all the time for any little reason. I still think that even if my heart races a bit that it’s the end, or if I get a random sharp pain, that I’m gonna die. It’s terrifying. I was on anti-anxiety meds for 5 weeks, prescribed 7 Ativan and I have been in touch with my therapist who I’ve had for 2 years already. But after the 4th week of meds, I decided to have a drink. 2 missed doses and drinking too much messed me up so bad. My anxiety was at its worst that it’s ever been in my whole life. For a week straight. I was so scared of everything. I called the ambulance to get my vitals checked and they reassured me it’s anxiety. It’s just a nightmare. As of today I’ve been okay for a week now. But today I had some anxiety and realized it’s never gonna completely go away or go back to normal. It’s always gonna be there. Just like the grief.\n\nI’ve had to shorten the story quite a bit. So many details but unnecessary to mention. I miss him so much, he was the only man willing to step up for my babies. I wanted to marry him, I wanted our life to be long together. His got cut so short. And this experience made me so scared to live life. Fearing that I will die. I used to be so careless about my life. I almost miss that, it was better than being scared all the time. It’s going to take a long time to heal from this. I want to be able to help others in the future, to let them know they aren’t alone and they’ll get through it. ",

        "Text": "While I’d rather be anywhere but here in this sub at the moment, I’m realizing I need to find ways to deal with this anxiety. I live in WNC and have been here throughout all of hurricane helene. I was alone in my apartment, just me in my pets, for a week and a half, so afraid at first we wouldn’t be able to get enough food or water. We had no power for 13 days, no cell service at all for 3 so I truly had no way to know if my parents who were trapped by fallen trees were alive or not. We had no running water for almost 3 weeks. Several towns are now gone, and reading yesterday that had the dam near me failed, I would likely be dead along with everyone in its path has just worsened my PTSD anxiety to a level it hasn’t been in a long time. I’m also a nurse at the hospital here and was back at work the Monday after it hit, so not even a break. We didn’t have running water there so we bathed using buckets. Work is still the only place I can get a shower. \n\nI am anxious about everything now. I go from obsessing over what if my pets and I had drowned along with tens of thousands of people to panic about the election (which was already stressful) to panic about things just so far out of my control it’s crazy. I did okay during the disaster, somewhat, but it’s just all hit me and I am trying to cope. Sleeping is proving pretty difficult with nightmares about drowning. How can I ever feel safe in my home again? \n\nI have an appointment with a therapist this coming week and I don’t even know how to talk about it. Condensing my OCD/PTSD history and explaining how I feel now just seems so overwhelming but I know I need to go. My anxiety now that the gravity of the situation is hitting is just awful. I don’t want to be crying a couple times a day and afraid to sleep in case something happens. Even light rain is terrifying for us now—it starts and my friends are panicking too because the last time it really rained left whole towns as rubble and killed so many people. \n\nThanks for reading—any suggestions as to ways to relax and cope temporarily would be wonderful. I will keep my therapy appointment and I’ve also ordered a trauma journal too. I appreciate anyone who read this. ",

        "Text": "I was diagnosed with CPTSD almost a year ago exactly. It gave me a lot of insight into my thought process and how/why I am the way I am. Still, there was no real before and after or symptoms (not to my knowledge). I had always been that way. It was just before and after being able to describe them though a diagnosis.\n\nThen five months ago, a traumatic event happened, a violent death. It's difficult because both the perpetrator and victim were family, so there's equal parts of loss and betrayal.\n\nNow I have a true delineation of before and after. Even if I had PTSD long before this, I had a lifetime of finding ways to hold onto my own identity amongst it all. Now I barely recognize myself.\n\nI'm really struggling right now. Treatment is a mixed bag. Medication has helped ease my nightmares and I'm drugged enough to get through the nights more or less. But during the day, my mind is so active. I think of everything that everyone around me might say, think, or do. I don't want to be caught of guard. I don't want to be vulnerable. This ranges from being \"prepared\" mentally in case a trip turn to the grocery store turns deadly to wondering if others close to me are planning bad things.\n\nI love my partner so much that love doesn't seem like a strong enough word. I am tremendously grateful for his companionship, his partnership, and the strength that both have endowed me with. I have always trusted him and he has always validated that choice back tenfold. He is the only person I feel physically safe around right now, even though I judge myself for being frightened that others may harm me physically for no reason whatsoever.\n\nThere's other ways my anxiety is suddenly manifesting though with regards to our relationship. He's been my rock and has picked up a lot of slack in helping me take care of even the basics-- making sure I eat, things like that. He hasn't pulled away. He's held me close. But now he'll be sitting next to me, doing nothing suspicious, and my mind jumps to wild conclusions about the longevity or security of our relationship. I've lashed out with sudden frustrations that don't adequately respresent my everyday state of mind or perception of our relationship. I've spiraled. \n\nI'm not working anymore. I'm grateful to be able to take some time off. I'm receiving short term disability. Which leaves me with quite a bit less per month than I usually made at work, but is helping me to try and \"focus\" on recovery.\n\nThe free time is also detrimental though because I just can't stop thinking. I just wish I could turn my brain off and rest. It's so hard to be present. When I manage it, im able to enjoy brief periods of life but then it all gets lost again in the chaos. I just wish it would be quiet.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, please let me know.",

This has been going on for like 2 months. I feel awful for depriving my partner of intimacy but it just makes me so nervous. I hate having sex. I hate sex. I'm not interested in it in the first place because I'm on so many psych drugs. Low sexual function is a side effect so I just started taking Buspirone 10mg to help. I'm in therapy and am debating starting ketamine treatment to help with the overall anxiety I have associated with sex along with helping my depression, and forming new healthy habits. \n\nWhat should I do? I don't want this to ruin my relationship. I have a very safe and open relationship so I never feel pressured but he gets depressed if we wait too long. I've done EMDR therapy for my C-PTSD and had an awful experience and refuse to ever do it again. My current therapist and I are doing cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I've even done ECT (electro convulsion therapy) to deal with my PAST suicidal ideations. It was a miracle for that but I'm still depressed. Does anyone have any supplements or remedies to help improve libido? I'm clearly open to trying things.\n\nI was also wondering what effects ketamine would have on C-PTSD. I've done research and the company I'd go with starts their doses at roughly 20mg daily. I asked the live chat about interactions with my medications and they said there were none. \n\nI'm on Clonazepam .5mg 3x daily for chronic anxiety, Vyvanse 50mg for ADHD, Sertraline 100mg, and Lamotrigine 150mg 2x daily for bipolar. Some of the resources I found implied that there COULD be interactions but I'm not sure if that depends on the dose or not. Thanks so much for your help and advice! ",

Mom's kin isn't really all suppotive because they're either as poor or just don't really care about us. My mother could always contact with dad's kin, even himself because they are kind and actually caring and supportive to each other (they divorced when I was 3 because \"they don't fit each other as a married couple\"). But she seemed to do this very rarely. We both went and still go through unpleasant financial problems (which only get worse and she doesn't even realize that). \n\nI understand that mother suffered from her own parents, that her father has gone when she was still young, her mother doesn't care about her etc. In fact, I was unable not to know that because she states her family issues every second time she breaks down which is a lot. She finds it normal to make her son she just screamed on comfort her.\n\nAnd these breakdowns weren't mere screams, – they made me unable to comprehend any normal quarrel or trouble because they seemed like a regular conversation in comparison. I thought that such humiliation was normal. Only recently it was shocking to me to even listen to someone's mental problems, I didn't even think people could be troubled so easily. I couldn't find one, ONE amusing or at least somewhat not frightening story I myself experienced in my childhood, couldn't remember a single moment I felt truly safe. But I do recall a lot of people asking me if I'm all right when I was simply standing or sitting, I turned out to never feel free neither. \n\nI undoubtetly was born without a goal of parenting but only means of calming herself. That childish, irresponsible brat! How come she finds it acceptable to be calmed by her own child and not the other way around? How does she want me to be empowered, to even want to live when almost everything she does is let me down and give nothing in exchange of suffering her tantrums? What the hell is she thinking? \n\nShe heals with time, however. It's disgusting to admit her current state is not even her worst. She belittled me in my childhood as much as one can belittle another. That she's broken does not excuse her in the slightest, why making a child in such conditions to begin with? Why is it that she depends on me but I would rather starve to death than contact to her ever again? \n\nBut, my life keeps going. I'm not close enough to dad and mom's family tree is a clusterfuck of unhealthy people and people who try to fix it. I prefer to just consider myself with no family at all. I believe only after I get rid of them all I can finally enjoy my life. ",

Almost a year ago, my best friend was going through a traumatic time and drove incredibly recklessly with alcohol in her system and me in the passenger seat. I didn’t know she was drunk until it was too late (I being 19 at the time didn’t have much experience or knowledge behind what drunk behavior would look like.)\n\nShe was screaming the entire time, got pulled over going 90 mph and got off with a warning because she was sobbing hysterically (The cop that pulled her over came to our passenger side since we were on the highway, which is probably why he didn’t smell the alcohol. I wish he would’ve so I wouldn’t have had to experience any of what she did to me.) , saying she felt like she was gonna crash her car, saying delusional stuff to strangers in traffic whilst stopping, made me drive after she promised me she wouldn’t do that because I have EXTREME driving anxiety and I had no idea where we were, then proceeded to drink more alcohol in the passenger seat and when I told her to stop she said it was just water, kept being on her phone whilst driving even after I begged her to stop, had the music up way too loudly so we couldn’t hear the directions when I tried to turn it down, swerving, stopping in the middle of city traffic for along time to find her vape, and was just really disrespectful to me the entire ride. I keep having nightmares about when she was driving me over the bridge and acting crazy. I thought for sure she was going to swerve us off. \n\nSometimes I can still smell the alcohol and hear the things she was saying. She did a bunch of other more messed up things, and in conclusion, had a whole month to apologize to me but never did. I gave her a home to live in, took care of her pet, drove her places, and quite literally took care of her. The fact that she put my life in danger, treated me absolutely horribly and just never apologized, and then proceeded to participate in a kiss with my partner is just a pain I can’t ever get over. The fact that she called me fucked up for calling her out and saying she’s disgusting for not apologizing to me makes my blood boil. She apologized for my partners behavior, but not hers. I didn’t deserve what she did to me. \n\nShe kept making the excuse that “she was dealing with extremely heavy things.” . I was also dealing with trauma but didn’t inflict more on her. I always have nightmares about her and I feel like I’ll never be free. She follows me everywhere and I just want her to leave my mind. She was nothing but a horrible friend to me, traumatized or not. She ALWAYS put men first and discarded me and what I’ve been through. When I was sobbing because of what she said to me, she was laying in bed with the random stranger she invited in her house instead of me. She didn’t care about the pain or trauma I also experienced. She didn’t care how she scared me when she punched the bathroom wall, or when she would constantly bring up porn and sex and I begged her to stop because I had my own sexual trauma. It was always HER trauma that mattered more. \n\nWhen she asked me where I wanted to sleep and I said her room, she said “oh well actually the boy wants to sleep with me tonight,” that hurt me badly. I feel my anger suffocating me about the entire situation. I want peace and I  want to be free from the nightmares. It feels like I never will. I understand she felt bad, but that doesn’t excuse her treatment towards me and the fact that she didn’t apologize. She could’ve owned up for what she did, but she instead chose to pretend it didn’t happen and blame it on her trauma and my partner (who was also in the wrong.) I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve had residential care for 3 months and intense therapy. I feel at a loss. \n\nEdit- for clarification, I cut both of them out of my life when it happened ",

        "Text": "Hi all\n\nFirst time posting to this thread. \n\nLately, as in the past four weeks or so, I’ve been struggling a lot with my PTSD. \n\nIt’s like an unwelcome relative that comes for a visit every so often and messes up everything around it. \n\nIn 1998, when I was 13F, I experienced a traumatic event. It took me about 7 years to seek help. Luckily, I found an amazing provider who was Harvard educated and was one of the few people doing EMDR therapy at that time in my area. She was phenomenal and truly saved my life. I was in a bad way when I went to see her, very self destructive. The EMDR literally saved me from myself. \n\nI went onto college, then grad school, got a medical degree, began practicing at a large company in my field just outside of Boston. \n\nWhile there, I broke up with a longtime boyfriend. Went back to dating online. Met someone, and sadly had another traumatic experience almost 20 years later. This second time was much worse. \n\nI tried to hold onto to my life at the moment. I was in denial it had even happened again and tried to brush aside the physical remnants of the bad event, tried to keep pushing on moving forward. But my performance at work started failing. I was making mistakes. I wasn’t myself. I couldn’t focus or concentrate. Nobody knew. Then I got sick. It was awful. \n\nI quit my job and moved into a family beach cottage. Away from the city. \nTried to regroup.  \n\nI was drinking again - now at the beach cottage.  I eventually realized I needed to admit to myself something had gone wrong - something had happened to me. Again.  \n\nI felt humiliated and ashamed that I could have “let this happen again”.  I sought out treatment, help again. And this time I knew where to begin. \nEMDR. \nFound an amazing specialist. She was expensive, but worth it. I went 2-3 times a week. I started working on renovating the cottage. I worked on starting my own practice in this new location. Started to live again with purpose. \n\nI work on many of the PTSD symptoms that were stopping me in my professional and personal life. She showed me how much I was dissociating and how often I would be triggered into panic attacks. She taught me how to ground myself. And the EMDR worked. It helped me admit what happened. Then start to heal. I still couldn’t work yet, but I was getting better. Then covid happened. \n\nFast forward a few more years, I’m still not back to working medical in my field.  Taking care of others the way I would want to show up for them and be the best provider I can be - seems impossible when I’m so deeply broken still. Damaged. Or that’s how I feel. \nI will go back to it someday. I hope. \n\nBut now, this year I have a partner and a little boy. The three of us and our little dog make up our happy little family. We love each other deeply and we’ve been able to spend so much time this past year together, watching my son grow and learn. \n\nBut the month of October can sometimes be hard. Some years it is not, like last year. Some years, it triggers bad memories, nightmares, anxiety attacks, drinking benders, and dissociation episodes that seem unavoidable. \nAnd now I have my little boy. \n\nThis month has been hard. I’ve been drinking more than I realized.  10 AM and I want to crack a beer open. I don’t - but I deeply want to. But why? There is no threat in my life right now. No major stress or impending doom. I’m content and happy on paper. \n\nThank god my partner is so understanding. It is one of the things that we share in common. He has C-Ptsd from an unsafe unstable childhood. So when I tell him, “I’m not okay right now, but please don’t hug me. I don’t want to be touched. I just need some time to readjust. I will be okay. I always am. Just please make sure our son is safe in his play area right now, so I don’t need to worry about where he is.” \n\nHe immediately understands, no questions asked. He helps me the way I need the help. I’ll do the same for him. \n\nI isolate. That is what I do when I feel my PTSD rearing up again. Isolating makes me feel better. But also makes me feel guilty. These days in October in New England are some of the most beautiful days we get. And I wanted to enjoy this beautiful Saturday afternoon outside with my baby boy and partner - but I just can’t today. I just need to be inside. In my room. In my bed. Resting and trying to calm down my nervous system. \n\n\nGround yourself. \n\nRepeat your mantra “ You are safe. You are safe. You are far away in time and space from that day. That person who hurt you is not here. They are far far away in time and space. You are safe. You are safe” \n",

I know when I am burning out, but honestly even though I am self aware I am not always good about dealing with it in healthy ways. I went looking for my ADHD diagnosis after doing a ton of my own research and so when I got that diagnosis in my head all I could think was “duh, tell me something I don’t know.” And boy did they. \n\nMy therapist a couple weeks later asked if he could give me the PTSD test, he didn’t call it that but I cannot remember the name for the life of me. I agreed and at the end I got my firm diagnosis. He literally told me “I’m sorry to say that you have PTSD.”  Needless to say I was in shock. For me my trauma was just a thing that happened to me and it was never like I went to war so why do I of all people have it. \n\nI ended up stopping going to my therapy sessions (I know, I shouldn’t have done that), and I ended just spiraling and thinking about how my life was not bad enough to have PTSD. Then I started actually thinking.\n\nI started thinking about the 4 times in my 25 years of life that I have been SA’d, one being at 3 yrs old. As well I started thinking about how my biological mother was an absent drug addict and the only mother figure I’ve ever known (not my biological mother) overdosed. And how my parents made me be the adult and their mediator at 13. And I started to realize that these aren’t normal things. But I genuinely started stewing in them and it started to cause me to spiral.\n\nMy struggles with sex and intimacy very recently killed a 5 year relationship and I don’t know how to feel healthy and good about it. I have always been open and talked about sex but hid the part of me that was uncomfortable with it. The partner that I was just with was the first person I was with that I didn’t have to have some sort of vice like alcohol to be with. I don’t know how to make myself comfortable with sex.\n\nI really need advice. I’ve been avoiding this but I can’t keep avoiding it anymore. Any advice is appreciated. As well idk if I’m ready to go back to therapy yet in all honesty. My main question is how can I work to have a healthy relationship with sex?",

Despite it ruining a lot of my life, I do find it interesting and I hope I can help others one say. However, this means I also read the diagnostic criteria for PTSD a lot and Criterion A always throws me off.\n\nLike I get what I went through sucked. Specifically there are 3 events that I think led to my problems with PTSD. And yeah most of my teenage years I dealt with abuse that I thought I would die from, but it was rarely physical just a lot of threats and psychological abuse. And in the other cases like yeah I could have been actually hurt, but I wasnt, again just threatened and harrassed (i think is the right word?). I saw a lot i shouldnt have seen and I felt alot I shouldnt have but I think the lack of actual directness bothers me maybe? Like it should have been worse to make me feel like this? I read other stuff and unintentially compare, and I know I shouldnt, but I always feel like im overreacting when im “fine”. At least until the intrusive memories come back or i flinch at a similar looking guy and then I think im valid until i get “better” again for a gap. Its also really frustrating that ive been through objectively worse experiences, but they dont bother me at all. Like whats up with that???\n\nIt makes me think what i went through wasnt real or actually traumatizing (even though its been “confirmed” by professionals that it was) but i still have to deal with all of the issues that came along with it? Its really frustrating. Especially because I know if someone told me the same thing happened to them I wouldnt think they were overreacting. But for some reason I dont feel that way about myself. Obviously I wish that it didnt happen at all, but if it had to why couldnt I actually feel like it was real and not be stuck in this middle ground half the time. Idk, no one else I know seems to understand or feel this way. I was hoping someone else may have a better understanding on here.\n\nThank you for reading this far. I just needed to tell someone because its exausting going back and forth like this.",

It was the first time in months, if not years, where I went over (not even in depth) what has happened to me and the emotions of it all came flooding back. \n\nIn my daily life, I don’t think about it, I just get on with things. Work, DIY, gaming etc. I don’t, ever, think about it. Flashbacks, or triggers or whatever, when they do happen, I just squash with something to distract me. Nightmares, dreams, maybe I’ll make a note off, but I don’t really reflect on them. \n\nI think I have just, got used to a life of dissociating, masking, and trying not to think about it…. So the emotions don’t come out. Seeking help from friends when I am upset is a no go because of how awful they have been in the past, dealing with it. People just don’t know what to do when someone is upset. So, I just, have adjusted my emotions and being to fit more ‘acceptable’. Not to say I would be going and having a mental breakdown each time I see a friend. \n\nBut yeah, I guess, Thursday was a bit of the shock to the system, because I actually gave time for my emotions to come out a bit. \n\nI guess, I wish I felt that seeking support from other people, was pointless. People really just don’t know what to do. \n\nSorry, not sure what this is. More of just a rant or something I guess. Just hope maybe someone understands. ",

Literally all my dreams were really bad nightmares since I was a teen, my mom was already really sick back then, and EMDR, about 5 years ago, helped a lot. I now still have nightmares most of the time but not every single night and they’re less intense. I also know what triggers it, horror movies and anything to do with anything paranormal, so I stay away from it.\n\nWell, I think I found a new trigger and didn’t realize how bad the trauma from my ex was, because I watched Woman of the Hour on Netflix on a serial killer in the 70s and basically relived that movie with my ex as the serial killer in my sleep just now. Normally my nightmares about my ex and the ones about my mom (and cat) dying are separate dreams, but this time everything came together in one nightmare and it was so awful. The whole dream I had to prevent my ex from killing my two current cats, and it ended with him killing both my parents in front of my eyes 😭\n\nI honestly thought I wasn’t as traumatized by my ex as I am. In therapy we discussed EMDR after I got out of that relationship but things seemed to got better, but this dream made me realized how I’m always looking over my shoulder in real life as well. I hate waking up like this and I also hate having another trigger, because I like true crime shows. I absolutely loved my mom, and she never did anything to traumatize me, it was just the situation we were in together. But my ex definitely did actively try to hurt me, and it’s just so scary to suddenly see all of that trauma come together in one dream…",

I hate myself for how angry I can be and the things I will scream. I'm in therapy. Goodness, I feel like I am trying everything but there is no permanent fix to my over- reactions. \n\nMy entire life I've had SI and I made my first attempt when I was 25. My second attempt was 4 years ago. My ingrained mindset is that my life will be short because I cannot be the mom my boys need me to be. So there's a subconscious bias towards not building the tightest bond with them. Which is not helpful! \n\nI know it would help for me to accept and be mindful about my mental illness. I love meditation and learning about Buddhism. I cannot get myself to incorporate the practices I learn in the real world. I lose my head so fast. I hate it. \n\nMy abuse began when my abuser would have been around 12 years old. Puberty is terrifying me. I feel sheer panic at any sex conversations and I worry that around every corner is a pedo. I have irrational reactions to him being online. \n\nI realize I'm so far gone and I need to get it together. I am doing TMS at the moment, for the second time. I've had countless hospitalizations, done a variety of therapies, tried Spravato, stayed at a residential place for women who experienced trauma...... I guess hopefully I'm better than I was but I don't want to freak out and scream at my sons even one more time. I scare myself, I know I'm scaring them. \n\nDoes it even make sense for me to hope I can be a better mother? They are obsessed with their dad so I often consider the idea of giving them to him completely and giving up on myself. Just so that I avoid doing any more harm to them. I weigh what might be worse - a parent dying by suicide or living with a screaming parent who is likely borderline abusive. \n\nHas anyone parented well with PTSD? Are my issues always going to be driving a wedge between my kids and I? What might be your thoughts? \n\nI appreciate your input so much. Thank you for reading and responding. ",

Towards the end, it felt less like a flashback and more like... purging? Detox? As of it was all finally leaving. \n\n\nNow I'm catching my breath & coming back to myself. I've got Spotify on with music, I'm singing quietly to regulate my breathing, I'm stimming, and I'm aware I'm dissociating slightly in order to keep my mind safe & away from those memories. ",

I didn't sleep for 30 days and I went into a psychotic state that I stayed in for months. I'm not psychotic anymore. I may not even be depressed anymore. But PTSD, that I have. The psychotic state was very traumatic. I had PTSD already from being on life support and nearly dying. This was worse though. It was like being on a Holodeck with all my worst nightmares. I still have to tell myself on a daily basis, it didn't happen, look at how ridiculous and impossible it all was. But it's harder to get through to myself that that wasn't real when I'm dissociating and am depersonalized and often derealized, not completely but a little. I don't feel real sometimes. During all of that I lost my memory. Now it's back, but other than my mom and dad, I don't really have any connection with anybody. My brother and sisters hate me and I feel no affection for them at all. It's like, I remember that life but I don't feel like it was me that lived it. And because of the nature of some of my psychosis, I reject feeling like myself again. Me = bad. Don't feel like me. The second I start feeling like myself, competent, even smart, I feel guilty and uncomfortable. Don't be him! I've started into therapy and want  EMDR, but I'd really love to solve it without his help. I'm not sure how much help people who haven't been through this actually have to give. And I'm so f\\*cking lonely. I have no friends. My family hates me. I have my mom but at 49 you need more than just your mom. I feel seriously stuck in this state. I will find a way out.

I was in therapy and got ahold of my anxiety. I had tapered down my dose of SSRI’s once I got to college and managed to really get my anxiety under control. I haven’t self harmed in 3 years. \n\nAnd then I underwent an experience that gave me PTSD, about a year and a half ago. Since then, all the work I did to finally get my anxiety and depression under control came crashing down.  I feel like I had taken years to make a ball of yarn out of a long thread, and within the span of months, someone attached a drill to the yarn and un-did all my hard work. \n\nI was suicidal and had thoughts of hurting myself for the first time in YEARS a few days ago. I’m slowly crawling out of a depressive episode that’s lasted a couple weeks - my last one was sometime in high school, and I’m currently a junior in college. \n\nI feel so frustrated with myself. I worked so hard to get to where I am mentally: lots of meds adjustments and therapy and me working my butt off to change my thinking. Not to mention tacking an ADHD diagnosis on top of my anxiety and depression when I was a senior in high school, which also required adding more meds, and I crushed it. I am so proud of myself for that. \n\nBut PTSD is the latest diagnosis and I feel like it has ruined me and set me so far back. I had to up my dose of SSRI’s. I’m back in intensive therapy - once or twice a week just to stay on track. My anxiety has a chokehold on me, and is combining with my ADHD to give me to worst anxiety paralysis of my life. \n\nI’m just so frustrated. I worked so hard. I want to lay down on the floor and kick and scream like a toddler because it’s just not fair.",

Every day it happens more frequently.\n\nThe thing is, I have never cut my face in such a manner. I did cut my index finger wide open about two years back, and I experienced similar flashbacks for a few days after the incident, but it hasn’t happened since.\n\nPerhaps a bit of background would help:\n\nI grew up in Mexico in a “war zone” between rival cartels, so I am no stranger to death and gore. I’d rather not get into details of things I saw growing up. Many of the friends I went to school fell victims to this violence, and less than half of the boys who were in my grade are still with us today. Never realized how messed up this situation was until I moved to the United States and saw that my childhood wasn’t “normal.” This hasn’t really affected me as far as I can tell though. I’m very introverted but I’ve always been that way. \n\nIs it possible that my childhood is catching up to me? Are the flashbacks from the old cut on my finger coming back? Or is my brain simply messing with me? \n\nAny assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. \n",

I guess, it is just very hard living in a world in which not only is there so much of this made up divide between men and women, treated as a condition of nature rather than nurtured differences, but over and over culture reflects this portrayal of who harm doers and victims tend to be that absolutely contradicts my experience \n\nI feel doubly isolated, on one end for not being a woman as a victim, and yet even moreso by having had multiple traumatic experiences of abuse coming from multiple women. The men in my life have actually, still with flaws (mainly neglect/ a lack of communication), treated me quite well and been supports in my life, but I am at a point where I struggle to connect with women, despite (logically) knowing that we are all just people. I find myself much easier to let down my guard with men and nonbinary people, but for whatever reason when it comes to women I dissociate, I start seeing myself from an outside perspective as I so often had to with abusers who were *determined* to paint this stereotypical picture of them as some loving, kind person and me as some kind of instigator. I don’t want to, but I feel so much worlds apart that I miss out on being able to connect with people who otherwise I often feel I could have been great friends with. \n\nIt especially can hurt even with women who are otherwise nice people, in that when it comes to things like abuse, I often find myself in a position where experiences like mine are minimized, where over and over I am expected to sympathize with a narrative that abuse is such a hard thing that *women* have to go through and fear from *men*. And I’m not stupid, I get that is the statistical majority and holds a different weight due to patriarchy influencing the dynamic, but I wish people realized that they don’t have to be so exclusive in discussions of gender, of abuse. And that gender doesn’t *only* play a role when it’s a man as a perpetrator and woman as a victim- each part of the puzzle just each comes with its own dynamic, and being a guy abused by a woman is still absolutely influenced in its own unique ways by gender dynamics. \n\nIdk, i have more to say but feel drained writing this, I want to speak from the heart about how this struggle has been sitting with me lately but I feel shut down by needing to filter as to not come off as some asshat MRA type. That need to filter so much in itself is ironically probably a big part of what I was getting at. \n\nThanks if you read this far. Might vent more on it here later, I have nowhere else to really ",

I'm always listening to every sound around me and watching every person around me, which makes it seem like I'm not paying attention. I've also been told that most of the time, I have an expressionless look on my face, which makes others think that I'm either bored, don't like them, don't want to be there, or all three. Last week, my neighbor called me out on giving her a \"thousand-yard stare.\"\n\nAnd then triggers are a whole other can of worms. I don't think I can ever forgive myself if something sets me off and yet another person suffers as a result of my incompetence.\n\nI'm just really scared. I want to have hope. I want to have even a fraction of the positive attitude younger me used to have. I want to be the same annoying optimist that I was when I was a kid, but I'm starting to think that I'm damaged beyond the point of fixing!",

I also had a terrible self harm problem from 11-16.\n\nMy ex bf and I had a 1.5year long live in relationship where we were very much in love, and even were planning to get married. I felt so safe and protected by him and have opened up to him about the intensity of my childhood trauma. He had always been kind, reassuring and soft. But his family didn't approve of me and he broke it off over a text message after promising me thousands of times that he'd convince them. They never met me - just that we were from different ethnicities so they disapproved and he couldn't stand up to them.\n\nI just feel retraumatized and violated again, just like how I was as a child. I feel shame and guilt for trusting someone who treated me this way, in the same way I have trusted my abuser(s). How can I cope with this. I have felt ashamed for years and so guilty over my sexual assaults and now someone whom I thought I would spend the rest of my life with also did this, reigniting all of my trauma.",

        "Text": "I originally shared this advice on someone’s post, but thought it might help more people. I hope this reaches those dealing with outbursts related to overwhelm. Remember, these are just symptoms—not reflections of your character—and you can lessen their impact over time.\n\nStart by learning about yourself and recognizing the signs of overwhelm as they build. If you feel yourself escalating, it’s crucial to intervene before reaching a state of overwhelm. I struggle with this too—throwing myself at objects, hitting, kicking, or clawing at anything. This isn’t because you’re violent; it’s because you deserved a break sooner.\n\nWhen you’re in a positive headspace, write down comforting activities you can turn to when needed. Some can focus on the trigger (like journaling about your feelings), others redirect your attention (like playing a video game or watching a comforting show), and some allow you to expel energy (like using bilateral tapping or somatic shaking). You might also designate a safe, calm space for recovery or use physical remedies like hot pads, baths, or showers for tension relief. Herbal remedies, such as ginger and chamomile tea, have calming and anti-inflammatory effects. For those who use THC to manage symptoms, this tea can help soothe respiratory and sinus inflammation (though not as a cure or prevention for smoking-related illness). I recommend adding oat milk!\n\nPersonally, I created an emergency/self-care bag with items I know I’d want someone to give me when I’m overwhelmed: journals, a book, fidget toys (especially ones you can squeeze), and multiple pre-written emergency plans. I even customized my own journal prompts with help from ChatGPT to ensure they’re ready to use without needing to think them up when I’m overwhelmed. These plans outline the steps I expect myself to follow when disoriented by stress. Over time, these coping skills become automatic as your brain recognizes the pattern and knows it’s time to take a break—just like the last 20 times we practiced!\n\nYou deserve to feel better. Take steps to plan ahead and intervene sooner. You do deserve to feel okay. Your energy isn’t your fault; it’s your body’s way of trying to keep you safe. Let it know it’s safe in your hands by practicing self-care sooner. You got this! \n\nI look forward to your comments! Questions about the advice are welcome❤️ I’ll be finishing my bachelor’s in medical case management this year, so I understand how to live with, manage, and find resources for these challenges—from both an advocacy/resource allocation perspective and a patient perspective.",

He would get drunk a lot, I haven’t spoken to him in almost 10 years after my mother moved with my at stepdad to a different city. I then opened up to my therapist about the SA and they told my mom and she told all her family including my stepdad. I disliked him when I was younger because he insisted he wanted to be my father so bad. The word father has so many good and bad connotations to it, I had one dad and he fucked it all up in my mental. I was celibate due to (said matters) but my stepdad always insisted in creating a vulnerable connection with me and him. He wanted to know about my se xual life  mostly… or a basic parent conversation , school or to discipline us. I get that he wasn’t in my life due to always working but still. My mom worked in peek morning hours so that when we came back from school she would be there. My stepdad got this tendency of coming into my room even to wake me up to ask me about my life and converse. He’s tried talking about the SA and asked me if I liked it because he used to reminisce about his SA experience with a “hot” babysitter. I felt terrified speaking to him and I hated being home alone when my mom wasn’t there because he did weird shit like wanting to be alone. I’m older now and I have my own place and my mom wonders why I don’t come to visit her. And mostly it’s because I dread seeing his car in the driveway. I put up a front when I lived under their roof but now that I’m older and able to focus on other things besides my safety I can’t see myself being there. Sometimes I complained a lot to my mom about how he rubbed me off \n a wrong way but she forced even harder a relationship, she simply won’t respect me, she even told my younger sister I’m lying about being SA with my real father. When I was younger I wasn’t very knowledgeable about the evil in the world so when my real dad told me if I spoke abt what happened he would go to jail for a really long time I was sad. He cried with me too about it and begged not to say something and my forgiveness allowed him to do it again.",

I have been told by a couple of previous therapists ( who were lovely, but I can no longer see due to moving states, which was very planned and a great growth moment) that I likely have medical trauma. I was, and am, a bit in denial about it because it seems strange? For a brief tldr, I was extremely over medicated for about 7 years in my teenage years and early 20s that caused some severe side effects, most notably very debilitating pain. I still have very strong reactions in doctors offices, often involving crying fits or simply avoiding them, and for the first two year after the rumination was constant, but I am since doing better.\n\nA major issue I'm having, and this feels ridiculous to say, is I cannot get over an enormous sense of dread when I do more than dip my toes into the art world. I majored in art and was preparing for a career in it, but the association with the sickness was so strong that I can't really do it to this day? I don't want a career in it, but it was the core of who I was for so long and brought me so much joy, I would kind of like it back.\n\nI am unsure of what else to do. First and foremost, I don't understand how I can be this haunted by some pills. Second, it makes treatment complicated. I am on an antidepressant still, but have been out of therapy a year. I am starting to wonder if trauma focused therapy may be good, but I'm perfectly functional outside of some bad days, and I don't know if EMDR would work since there is no specific events, just 7 years of little terrible shit for no reason.\n\nI want to know if anyone has dealt with anything similar and has tips for learning to enjoy the things I associate with it again.",

It's like there is a thunder cloud over mij head raining doom and gloom upon me. I feel shivers. I need to hold on to my teddy bear real tight and keep my eyes closed in order to not panick. I need to lay completely still. The images, remarks, sounds, things that were said all replay in my mind and make me feel super sad to the point where I feel like I need to vomit because it's just too much. It's this overwhelm of hopelessness and despair that comes with seeing another day and realising this is my life now. \n\nIn the evening right before bedtime it's a bit better. Falling asleep is the best part of my day.\n\nWhat about you?",

I’m not sure if this is the right place but I wanted to write my experience and see if anyone has been down the same road as me. \n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD & Gambling Disorder after beginning addiction treatment for gambling. I began weekly sessions with a psychiatrist in July to begin to address my addiction with gambling. In relation to PTSD, my psychiatrist has told me I relied heavily on gambling as a coping mechanism for trauma stemming from child abuse. Notably my relationships were strained and dying as I would withdraw & shutdown when I needed to communicate. I’ve been working on communicating my feelings and trusting people I care about to show me empathy again. \n\nI want to ask if anyone else has experienced the high of gambling in that it removed the feeling of being scared? For me it allowed me to feel big in a world I felt so small in. I was scared of being judged and I still am, but now I take a deep breath and ground. I am a good person. I am trying to learn because I deserve to be happy. I make this post because I want to see if anyone has experienced this relationship with gambling as a coping mechanism too. Thank you again for your time. ",

I have been very hesitant about saying I have PTSD, even in therapy and with a psychiatrist I've seen, I have been hesitant to brig up the idea I might have it. I was bullied heavily in kindergarten until 8th grade, I'm a survivor of CSA, and a SA in high-school by a close friend. What was even more triggering was reporting that SA to my school, being forced to tell my parents in order to report it, and then speaking out to the school board about how the school mishandled my case, only to have my small town turn their backs on me and have the guy spread lies about me through the whole school and town. Some people called me brave, I still don't feel brave. I feel used and regretful, I can't meet anyone from my highschool or town without being sent into a panic and wondering if they believe the lies that were spread about me. \n\nAbout once every few months, I google PTSD and CPTSD, and search through the symptoms. So much of it applies to me, but I have a voice in the back of my head telling me that I didn't go through enough to have it, or that I'm just playing the victim. I tell myself that I'm using the idea as an excuse for why I haven't amounted to much in my life. \n\nBut I'm just left wondering that what if why I'm like this, is because of my trauma and my inability to entertain the idea that I could be struggling more than I thought. The idea that what happened to me did affect me, even years later. ",

Now I am depressed all the time, i feel numb but my body wants to cry. I feel emotionally unsafe in my home( i live with my family) because they have done so much stuff to me. Luckily i have a safe place where i go 2 days a week. My teachers and my mental health team(CCS) is really all the support i have. I have been so dissociated and numb lately that i can’t express my emotions. I have been trying to express my emotions to my teachers( out of the 5 of them I only really trust 2 of them) but I am so good at hiding it that it’s hard. \nI really want to tell my teacher that I am struggling in the moment but I can’t, I am to afraid of being a burden and wasting her time. Now me and this teacher have a very strong relationship, she has been there for me always. I think what I am most afraid of me starting to cry and not being able to talk, now i could text or email her but same issue I don’t feel safe enough to cry at home. I think i told her last week about my parent issues. But i think i was dissociated. The reason why i am bringing this up is because my IEP is coming up and my parents will be there, and i am scared. I don’t know what to do.  I can’t hold in my emotions for much longer. I am wondering if I should make myself upset and tell her or tell her and risk crying?\nThere are some other questions I have:\nThe first question I have, is there such a thing as PTSD episodes? I also dissociated \n\nThis question goes a long with the first question, can you get traumatized by this episodes?\n\nThe third question I have, when dissociating can you hear or is the brain completely shut down?\n\nAnother question I have is can you have a panic attack while you dissociated? When I come out of a dissociative state i feel like i can’t breathe for a couple seconds. \n\nI just hate being a burden and I know my teacher is on my side and cares about me and wants me to communicate with her. But that’s the thing I feel bad because I care about her also. \nSorry for the long post. I just don’t know what to do. ",

I abandoned all my hobbies and stopped talking to basically everyone for so long that I can't even remember who I am anymore.

I can't even talk to my own family because I don't feel like I can relate to anyone anymore. I'm just quiet and timid all the time.

There have been times I've been scared I'll lose my job, which is just another source of stress now\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Does it ever go away?

Barricaded me in the bathroom and cornered my partner in our living room, hands on holsters. They were extremely hostile and aggressive and I fully believed I was about to watch a murder. They accused my partner of having a knife, which was completely false and there was no reason to think that. At no point did they ask any standard question for mental health first responders. I begged them over and over to leave so we could all stand outside and have a calm conversation with the paramedics. After a long standoff they finally agreed, then they barricaded us again in the hallway. I put my body in between my partner and the cops and just calmly asserted over and over that we could all speak outside. I knew one wrong move and I would be arrested and my partner would be brutalized or killed.

        "Text": "Hi. I'm Mark. It's 10:23 pm. I'm in my car trying to sleep. I'm 19 and escaped my parents several months ago. Horribly abusive people. Looking at their faces haunts me. Sets off a fight or flight response. I'm genuinely terrified of my parents. I finally blocked them on all socials along with half my family, who thinks what they did to me was the right thing to do.\n\nI have 9 sisters and 1 brother. Most of my sisters believe I deserved to be tied up and beaten. I deserved to have my hands tied behind my back with duct tape and kicked around the garage floor while my father is laughing. I deserved to be tied to a bench press and beaten with a wooden spoon by my smiling father while my mom watches for a minute in the background, leaves, and lets my father finish. I deserved to have my father grab a knife and yell at me, telling me that it's time for me to die. I deserved to have my face painted like a clown by him, so he could force me to clean the house while all my siblings laughed at me. This barely scratches the surface of what my parents have, in their free, fully functioning, completely sane minds, and free, completely uncompromised will chosen to do to me. \n\nI don't know what I did. I wish I could say I was sorry. For what?? I don't know! If I hurt someone, I didn't mean to. What did I do to deserve it? I really don't know. I wish I deserved it. I know I have autism and ADHD, and that they are associated with emotional dysregulation, so I was prone to temper tantrums. But every kid has meltdowns! Why am I the one who gets brutally assaulted by his parents? The one who gets spanked bare-skinned by a metal spatula? The one who gets hit as hard as possible multiple times by a belt by his father, a former football player and soldier in the army? The one who has scissors placed around his finger while my father squeezes the scissors, threatening to cut off my finger? The one who has his room door taken off his hinges? The one who gets punched in the face and called a pussy because he's crying over geometry homework, and bleeds all over his homework?\n\nIt's all in the past now, but the damage is still there. I'm over it and I want to move on, but something is really off psychologically and physiologically. I know I have complex PTSD, but I've been experiencing something new lately.\n\nThis weird thing keeps happening at night. I'll suddenly start twitching or ticking and hyperventilating. I'll start screaming and crying. The craziest part? I'm not even thinking about my parents. I'm thinking about something completely chill and unrelated, yet I just feel so goddamn stressed during the most relaxing part of the day, when I'm safe in my car all snuggled up in blankets.\n\nWhy does this keep happening and only at night? During the day, I can talk about the past like it's nothing. At night, even the slightest mention of it makes me want to ball my eyes out and scream into the night sky.\n\nI'm just so confused on how I could be thinking about super relaxing happy things, yet my body is just so stressed and high strung -- and this only happens at night. It's as if I have two minds, and my body reacts to the mind that I have no control of, the subconscious that is remembering the past. But I will have no idea what my body is remembering. I just feel super stressed, but I don't know what I'm so stressed about.\n\nAnd now I feel less stressed after typing this all out on my phone, but I don't want to put my phone back down. I'm scared of my thoughts. I keep fidgeting and moving around. I just want to sit still and sleep. It's 11:13 pm and I'm still typing. I just want my thoughts to shut up for once in my goddamn life. \n\nAnyway, I just wanna know how it's possible that I feel so terrified at night when I'm just thinking about pleasant things, like projects I'm working on or the cool things I've done today. \n\nI spend a lot of nights when I'm like this fantasizing about having someone to cuddle with, someone to place their hand on my face and kiss me, telling me everything is gonna be ok. But that's not gonna happen for a long time, and I want to know how you guys cope with this sort of thing when you're completely alone and isolated from everything you've ever known.\n\nSorry for the disorganized chaotic nature of this post. I'm going through another one of these \"episodes\" while I'm typing, so it's hard to think straight. Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be able to respond in a better way. ",

        "Text": "Context: When I was younger (7, I think), I got my period for the first time after being exposed to hormonal cream, but that's not the traumatizing part. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me after a urine test, so they decided to do a blood test. Since I was little, I was terrified; what do you mean a random man is gonna stick a needle in my arm and steal my blood?! But one of my friends would reassure me that \"It's fine! I had some blood drawn when I was younger; it wasn't THAT bad!\" I believed her, of course. What else was I supposed to think? So, my mom drove me there and I was a little nervous, but not really. It'd just be like getting a shot, except instead of putting something in, they're taking something out. I got there, I got into my little hospital gown, whatever. I sat down on the bed-thingy and then the man came in. I don't remember the part up to it that well, other than them feeling my inner wrists and elbows (which I'll mention later) but I remember looking at my mom and closing my eyes tight since I didn't wanna see the blood. After he took the needle out, I was almost immediately smacked in the face with nausea and fatigue; I was a tiny little 7 year old girl, and getting even a little blood drawn drained me horribly. \n\nNow, why is this traumatic to me? Well, honestly? No clue. But the side effects of it are horrible. Not only did I immediately feel terrible, but only a few days later, my aunt, a nurse, checked out my veins, touched my inner wrists and elbows (I can't even touch them myself without letting out a sob) and said \"Ooh, you've got some nice veins!\" Little me was very uncomfortable and ran away into a corner to cry. But now, years later, I still can't even type this without tearing up; I'm crying right now actually. Can't talk about it; I'll cry. I saw a video where someone getting blood drawn was suddenly shown and I buried my face into a pillow and started crying. I read a book where someone got an IV and I had to put the book down because I was uncomfortable. Sometimes, I can feel the veins in my arms. It's very uncomfortable, if you were wondering; also a bit painful. Sometimes I even feel bad about how me being so terrified of getting my blood drawn means I can never donate it to people in need of it. Also, said friend who comforted me earlier said when I talked about it, \"Oh, I just got a lot more blood removed and I felt just fine. You'll probably feel better soon.\" She said that to me about a week after I got it drawn. It's been years and I'm still caught up about getting only a little bit of blood drawn. I feel so pathetic; after all, some of you here have gone through horrors that no one should even have to think about, and yet here I am, crying over some old blood I got drawn. \n\nAlso, they learned absolutely nothing from the blood test. It was completely useless.",

I (21f) have diagnosed CPTSD due to being abused my entire life physically, sexually and emotionally, by many people including my family, and I have really bad health anxiety. The people who were meant to love and nurture me did the opposite. It’s to the point where I convince myself I’m dying, and then I physically feel like I’m dying and it’s like my mind becomes out of control and I become a feral animal. I act like a crazy person and scream and cry about how I’m dying and pull out my hair, normally I’m a very rational, calm and nonchalant person who struggles with expressing any emotion. It’s like I become possessed and start acting like a child, and it’s so embarrassing. I think it stems from never feeling safe in my body due to being abused and never having anyone care about me or protect me as a child, and feeling like I’m always in danger and something bad will happen to me. It’s so hard to deal with and so isolating. I currently have a bacterial sinus infection, and yesterday my symptoms got worse and I convinced myself I had meningitis and that I was going to die. It physically felt like I was dying, and I was crying and screaming like a child in the ER, it felt like I became a completely different person.

He expressed slight disappointment because we swore we put it in the bags and the lack of mushrooms kind of messed up the recipe we were going for. I almost immediately was flung into an attack, terrified(unreasonably) that I would receive physical harm over the mistake, so I retreated to the bathroom. About three minutes passed and he realized I was gone, so he walked into the bathroom and found me curled up on the floor hyperventilating, completely unable to speak. He helped me calm down and was very gentle and understanding. However, I am feeling so much shame and guilt over the whole incident.

I was grateful for him telling me.  He was able to message a couple times Saturday, but no responses on Sunday.  Or Monday.\n\n  Monday night I started to get concerned, but not overly so.  I was chatting with another friend and noticed he didn't even OPEN something I sent him Sunday.  And I burst into tears, convinced he was gone, or in the hospital, unable to access his phone.  I tried all my grounding tools and nothing was helping.  I spent monday night in an utter panic, crying and unable to sleep.  Same Tuesday morning.  \n\nI did hear from him Tuesday and he was fine, but... what the F happened here? Is this PTSD??? I'm not usually like this and would have assumed he was busy or tired from his trip... but I went off the deep end, going as far to open one of his social media pages to see if anyone posted he was gone.  \n\nIm embarrassed now, and didn't see it coming. But the second I saw unopened messages, it was like all the pain and shock from last year was right back.\n\n",

        "Text": "I’m M (22 years old). Two years ago, I ended a long relationship where I got cheated on, which really hurt. I moved into a different apartment (we lived together), started a job (I had been studying), and began working out again because I gained weight during the relationship. Over time, things improved—I built a good physique, made money, and life was going fairly well.\n\nFast forward to April this year: I decided to apply for the Student Work and Travel program in the USA (I’m from Europe) for a summer job. I wanted a change of environment and to meet new people. Plus, I always wanted to visit the USA.\n\nA month later, I arrived in the USA and met a girl, F (21). I really started liking her, and over time, I noticed she might like me too. Other people looked at us when we joked, and the girls gossiped about us. It took me 20 days to tell her how I felt because I was scared. She said she liked me too, and we agreed not to get attached since we were from different countries (though only 3-4 hours apart).\n\nAfter some flirting, she finally kissed me. We had an amazing month and a half together. As time passed, I started wanting to continue our relationship after we went back, but I was scared to say it. One night, just before we left, she asked what we were doing afterward. I knew she wanted to continue, but I hesitated and said I needed time to think.\n\nA few days later, I told her I wanted to keep talking, and she agreed. Then, a week before we left, we found out she was pregnant. We were in shock. After some time, I told her it was her decision to keep or terminate the pregnancy. She chose to terminate it, and I supported her but felt bad about it.\n\nI started fearing she would leave me after that. I told her multiple times I was surprised she hadn’t dumped me. This made her angry, and she told me to stop repeating it. I couldn’t shake the fear of losing her, especially when she said she wanted space after the procedure.\n\nHer birthday was 20 days ago, and I offered to visit her, but she needed time to detach from America due to feeling awful about what happened. She insisted it wasn’t about her feelings for me, but my anxiety worsened. I began checking her social media and became paranoid if she followed any guys. I knew it was unhealthy but couldn’t stop.\n\nArguments began almost daily over my overreactions. I noticed she was getting fed up, which only heightened my anxiety. Recently, she said she couldn’t continue like this, and I agreed, knowing I needed to work on myself. We parted on good terms.\n\nTwo days ago, she texted that she wanted to talk later. I panicked and asked if it was about another guy, which made her angry. She told me she couldn’t deal with my reactions anymore and called me selfish for focusing only on my feelings.\n\nAfter reflecting, I realized she was right. I told her she gave me a reality check and wanted to talk. She said we weren’t on bad terms, but I felt like we were. I asked again what she wanted to tell me, but she hasn’t replied yet.\n\nI feel awful for causing her stress. Friends from the USA have asked about her because she isn’t replying to anyone. I know I’ve put her through too much emotional turmoil.\n\nAt this point, I don’t want to get back together because I need to fix my past trauma and anxiety first.\n\n**If anyone has advice on how to manage my anxiety and fix my mindset, please help! Also, if there’s anything I can do to make her feel better, let me know.**\n\nThank you for reading this far. <3",

        "Text": "TW: suicide, self harm, SA\n\nA brief background: I (36f) have PTSD from a sexual assault many years ago, and the anniversary is coming up on Saturday. There’s a lot of other stuff going on for me, too, and, in the last six weeks, I’ve gotten incredibly depressed, have mood swings and severe irritability, I started cutting myself which I haven’t done in 15 years, I’m behaving fairly erratically, I have zero impulse control, and the suicidal ideation has been frequent. It’s been a rough time, to say the least. \n\nI’ve been working very closely with my therapist of six years throughout this depressive episode, and she’s amazing. But I’ve suddenly started getting really angry with her, and lashing out, and just starting to feel really resentful and bitter and directing it at her, for no particular reason, which is definitely new. I’m clearly subconsciously trying to push her away but I couldn’t figure out why. \n\nAnd then it hit me.\n\nThe main reason I haven’t acted on my suicidal thoughts is because I have to imagine that a therapist losing a client to suicide has got to be incredibly, deeply traumatizing and I can’t do that to her. And I think on some level, I want to push her away so that I’ll be able to do whatever I want without guilt. I really don’t think I have it in me to go through with anything, thankfully, but I think part of me still wants to purge anything and everything keeping me from going through with it, starting with my therapist. \n\nI don’t even know that I have a specific question here. I guess I just want to know if anyone else can relate to this, and what you did if you found yourself in a similar situation? Obviously I will talk to my therapist, but I still feel angry with her, and bitter and resentful toward her, even though I know it’s misplaced and she hasn’t done anything wrong. So what do I do with those feelings? Ignore them? Channel them somewhere else? Keep directing them at her but tell her why I think I’m doing it? I have no clue. But the emotions are intense and my subconscious really wants to direct it at her, and I feel really bad about that. And I really don’t want to actually push her away, because I definitely need her support right now. ",

Due to us being neighbors, the abuse was constant and me and my family were constantly living jn fear.  This person is a mentally unstable malignant and highly covert narcissist that over the years had drew us in thru brilliant manipulation.  When we finally received their final soul crushing blow I had no choice but to pack up my beautiful home, leave my historically low interest rate, rip my kids from their friends and schools, leave my job and move as far away as I could.\n\nCurrently I am in sort of a protective custody type life trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.  My entire family is in therapy and I suffer from terrible PTSD, nightmares, screaming in my sleep, major mood swings, times of intense rage, memory loss and time perception issues and a slew of physical issues caused by the extreme stress for so long.  I hadn’t slept a full 8 hr night in 13 months.  My career is hanging on by a thread.  My children get horrific hate messages from the kids at their old school because of the slander and defamatory lies that the neighbor has spread from us causing their narcissistic injury and leaving.\n\nOk… sorry about all that, just had to lay context.\n\nAll my therapists tell me there is not way that I will ever receive closure from this person for all the trauma they have inflicted.  That I should not confront the narcissist and “move on”.  There is nothing I can think of that I feel would bring me more peace than to try to explain to this person what they have done.  I know it won’t change the past and the narcissist being the narcissist literally will not accept blame of any kind.\n\nMy therapist then told me to start writing on this platform to help me process and accept things so here I am….\n\nHow can I go on without some tiny insignificant form of justice or validation be achieved.  I feel it will just boil inside me forever.\n\n",

        "Text": "I'm sorry if the English is bad. I'm sorry if this is too long, this is my first time using Reddit to post. Thank you\n\nWhen I was 16, I was raped by my then gf (now ex), and it's still affecting me now; to the point where my psychiatrist diagnosed me with PTSD now at 17. I didn't know it was SA back then because I assumed that it was just a normal occurrence to feel the kind of naked shame after the act. It felt like I committed a sin, maybe because I am Christian, but I feel dirty even until now. I've developed a severe rash from scratching myself because I have this itch from some dirt beneath my skin or idk how to explain im sorry. But essentially, she forced herself onto me because it was an \"expected thing\" from relationships, I didn't say no, but I didn't say yes either. I don't know, maybe it was my fault for not saying no.\n\nThe problem is that it is starting my academics and organization responsibilities. She's the school government president and I'm one of the school government officers; there have been times where I've skipped school to avoid seeing her, or just crying and breaking down during an online officers meeting because of her voice. My grades have been slipping too. \n\nI talked to my guidance counsellor about this, and it was going really well. Until they essentially forced me to talk to her (as in, I was crying and begging to not talk to her but they literally physically grabbed me and dragged me into the guidance room where she was crying). During the meeting, she was crying. She essentially said that \"if you said no, I would have respected that. If you resisted, I would have stopped. But you didn't.\" And she was crying a lot, she doesn't want to be called a rapist because it apparently feels like she is evil. I had to stop crying so I could say what I wanted.\n\nThe teachers in the meeting decided not to suspend her, to protect her and me - and I was put on leave from doing any school org responsibilities. She is now paying for my new medication and covering for my sessions. But I still have this anger inside me. I feel like shit everyday and even just seeing her happy (i. dont. care. if she is faking it) or just her profile on social media - I have a panic attack and I cry for hours until I fall asleep. \n\nShe just seems so happy, as if nothing happened. She is still the school government president, it was ME that had to adjust. She still has everything. I tried everything, but I'm starting to think that it was better off if I never opened up at all. I want her to die, to suffer, to have EVERYONE in the school know what she did.\n\nMy mother and psychiatrist told me to use this anger as a motivation for success. That the best way to get revenge is to be successful and move on. But it's so hard that I'm starting to consider ending my life, because by then I would know that people would actually take my death seriously and take her accountable for her actions. But I don't want to leave my family alone, what should I do? ",

I have no idea where he's going or if he will still do counseling. He asked if I still wanted to have counseling and I said yes. We went through a series of questions to hopefully match me with a new counselor I like. \n\nFast forward to today, it was our last session. I haven't heard from the company about a new counselor and he acknowledged that, and said they will contact me but he doesn't have any information beyond that. But he also softly suggested that I might not need counseling anymore. I have a good support system and know how to lower my anxiety. \n\nSo now I'm contemplating whether I should still attend counseling or not. I'm afraid I won't like a new counselor. My life is mostly settled. I take Cymbalta but it's not just for anxiety, it also helps keep my neuropathy pain mostly in check. Yes, Cymbalta helps with nerve pain. My life was unlivable before Cymbalta because of pain. Now I can do daily tasks as long as I don't overdo activities that require a lot of walking and standing.  For context I live in NYC and don't own a car. So everywhere I go requires a significant amount of walking.\n\nWhat advice do you all have?",

Like why has that ruined my mental state for almost 10 years. Why does me getting fucked as a child make me hate myself and be depressed for the REST OF MY LIFE. Why can’t I get over it. Why do I obsess over it. Why do I have nightmares. Why do I need alcohol to forget about it. It makes I no sense. I just want to have a normal life man. I don’t get why I’m like this. I wonder if my rapist knew how much my life would be ruined if it would’ve still happened. Maybe my rapist thought I’d never understand or would be over it by now and my life would be sunshine’s and rainbows by now. I hate my life. I just want to be ok I. I miss that 8 year old. I wish I could go back and tell her not to trust my rapist. Now I’d be ok. I’d have a good life. Good mental. Health. I’d be ok. I wouldnve done the rest of my childhood. \n\n",

        "Text": "CW: Sex, rape, sexual abuse, humiliation, degradation, suicide, physical abuse, mental abuse\n\nLast night, I was about to have sex with my girlfriend and everything went horribly wrong. \n\nIn the past I have seen and gone through lots of rough periods in my life. I have witnessed events that someone my age should never have to go through. The most recent is from about 6 years ago and the earliest one is 15 years ago. I am now 27 and things are getting worse and worse. Let's get started:\n\n12 years old: I saw my best friend jump in front of a train. The day before that he told me he wouldn't commit suicide and that he didn't want to leave me behind, but that day, after it happened, I came home to a message on my phone saying: \"I am sorry but it's my only way out, my dad just beat me up and raped my brother, I can't do this anymore.\"\n\n18 years old: my dad fell down 5 meters and broke a lot of bones and shattered his hip, my mom had a deadly intestine infection, my brother got arrested for street robbery and my parents got extremely physically abusive. \n\nI came out as trans to my parents, got bullied for it by my parents, berated, physically abused, threatened (death threats) and all my girl stuff got broken by my mom. As I found the stuff she was standing in my door opening, saying: \"if you want to be a girl, than you should learn to clean like a girl\"\n\n19 years old: I saw a motor driver lose control of his bike. I was the first one at the place, saw how injured he was, had to take care of him till the the ambulance came. Before he passed out, I asked for his parents phone number. Later on, police was questioning everyone, I told them I had their phone number and they nodded. 15 minutes later they told me to call his parents and tell them that he may not survive. His parents screamed, cried, had mental breakdowns and lost all hope. \n\nA couple of weeks later, a random guy jumped in front of a train at Amsterdam Sloterdijk. I saw him being ripped apart, just like my best friend back in the day. \n\n22 years old: I was dating a girl, she always insulted my sexual achievements, wouldn't cuddle and even once gave me a concussion, by repeatedly hitting my head. The day after, she asked me for sex. I refused and went on with my day. She drugged my food/drink with Viagra and raped me that night. I woke up to her riding me and threw her off me and slept somewhere else. The next day, I left the place and she chased me with a knife, yelling: \"if I can't have you, nobody will\" she dashed at me, I took her arm, broke it and ran away. \n\nLast night, everything came at me at once.\n\nI was about to have sex with my girlfriend, we just had a lovely time of cuddling and I was hard as rock. She got ready to get on me and the moment that she did, I collapsed. My mind replaced her face with my ex's face and I could hear all the words she ever said to degrade me loud and clear in my head. \n\nI collapsed in my girlfriend's arms. She cuddled me and made sure I was safe. At that moment, I had the worst thing ever happen to me: all the trauma that I have in my life came back at once. I felt everything, I saw everything, I heard everything. All the emotions, all the insults, all the screams and at the end of it all, I was left in the worst state I have ever been in in my entire life. I never felt worse. \n\nToday, I am feeling like utter shit. I can't recover from this today and idk when I will. I can't have a psychiatrist yet, since I just moved to another country and am not a full citizen yet. I need help and idk what to do. \n\nPlease tell me how I can deal with this. What helps and what doesn't. I am desperate and need all the help I can get. ",

This was a long time ago, and far be it from me to offer a diagnosis, but all I really remember is that they were both wheelchair bound with breathing tubes and required assistance for all tasks. Neither could communicate. I thought it was sweet he was helping his parents while going to college. Turns out nothing is sacred.\n\nI showed up during breakfast time, he finished seating his siblings and began making eggs. I stood nearby, leaning against the cupboard behind me. Making conversation with me, he started flirting a bit and grabbing me sexually. I pushed back from him kissing me and made it known that I was profoundly uncomfortable going that far with PDA in front of his siblings as they were 13 and 10. He pushed back, and basically implied that his siblings were so disabled that they wouldnt know whats going on and they dont count as people watching??? I can't remember the exact conversation, but I know his face got dark and he grabbed me harder. I'm very little. He easily picked me up by my left leg and my throat, slamming me against cabinet I had just been leaning on moments ago. \n\nThat's the flashbulb. Not being able to breathe, my ears ringing, head hurting, hip hurting, his forceful kiss, his awful breath, all while I made eye contact with his little brother over his shoulder.\n\nGoodbye all, I need to throw up for a while. I'm sorry if you read this.",

Yes, that is literally what I said. It was a normal day up to that point and I was doing my freight, till I was told to come back to office.\n\n Per policy it's supposed to happen in the office closest to the doors, which is the courtesy they give to people who are actually stealing, doing drugs in the bathrooms, etc. Oh no. I was perp walked through the entire store, having to tell the cop where to go because he had no idea, while in cuffs. I later learned from close friends that Coaches (supervisors) were mocking me after I left by pretending to walk with cuffs. I have nothing on my record, not even a speeding ticket, and they've RUINED this part of me.\n\nDon't worry though, they told me I'm allowed the continue to shop there... No thank you. \n\nI was then held in jail for four hours while my poor co-workers, who have become my family over the last 7 months, and my husband panicked and called my parents and they all came and bailed me out. I had to change into jail clothes, mug shot, the whole thing. \n\nAnyway, I'm trying to stay out of depressive swings, but it's hard. The \"justice\" system takes forever and I'm waiting to talk to the DA.",

I have posted here before (ended up deleting after people telling me I was overreacting and that my problem was \"phone addiction\") and shared the story with family members and friends but no one seems to take me seriously.\n\nI was robbed last week with no violence. It all happened very very fast and thankfully no physical damage.\n\nI really have no emotional attachment to my phone or any personal belongings, but my phone was UNLOCKED. This means the guy had access to all of my apps containing all of my date for about two hours, until I was able to make it home to remove the device from my Apple account. He had access to conversations I had with my husband, my therapist...\n\nHe went through my social media (I am not guessing, he really did). He went through my food delivery apps (where my address/work address was saved, but also the address of plenty of friends and family members) and ordered a bunch of shit in my account (obviously to a random address, not to his address). He saw my pictures (no nudes but it really hurts me that he had access to pictures of my family, of me, of my passport, of my id, etc). He knows who I am, he knows where I live. He knows the gym I go to. He knows where I work. He knows my thoughts, even, because I always enjoyed writing and leaving stuff in my Notes. He got to know my entire life in those few hours, and I am so scared of leaving the house.\n\nEveryone says its nothing personal and he does not give a damn about me because he steals 50 phones daily. I know that (rationally). But as someone who was stalked before (I was a 15 yo  stalked by a random guy at school and this caused A LOT of emotional pain) I am very easily triggered and since this guy had access to my entire life, I got super scared.\n\nNot sure this is PTSD, though, or \"simply\" anxiety and constantly being on alert state.\n\nI am exhausted and I am having a very hard time concentrating at work. I am easily confused, get lost in time & space, get easily distracted, my house is a mess, I am late to everything. Its like I went to therapy for years to become a better version of myself and recover from creepy high school stalker and now I am scared of going back to the same place.\n\nPS: I don't mean to offend anyone because I know some people go through stuff that are 100x worse than this, I am not trying to say I have been through the worse thing ever and I am not even trying to affirm that I have PTSD... I just want advice, really.",

        "Text": "Hi. I had a traumatic event in a hike 2 years ago. I was reaching a mountain summit a little bit after sunset, and I was running late, as I should had been there already. The day had seen harsh weather, but its ending would be absolutely terrible. I was greeted by a heavy cold frontal rain that overcame my rain covers and left me soaking wet and cold at night. I had no energy left to warm up my body by walking and had to still set up the tent, make food and sleep. Luckily I was in a group that helped me, and we managed to pull through. I used my emergency blanket to warm up as quickly as possible and tucked inside my sleeping bag. I had never felt so much cold in my life.\n\nShivering, I slept, and the night was luckily calm. The morning sun had never been so welcome, and it helped me dry everything and depart in not such a miserable state as I was during nighttime.\n\nAnyway, I didn’t pay much attention to this day back then. I thought it was just a mishap, something that can happen to anyone.\n\nBut I started to notice that it changed my life without me even realizing. Now, I always carry an extra piece of clothing, and I usually don’t feel as hot as the people around me. That seemed okay, maybe I just learned to play a little on the safer side?\n\nYeah, but the problem is I absolutely can’t stand the cold anymore. Any cold at all. I get out of a shower to a cold bathroom in a hotel? - I get shivers, a metallic taste in my mouth and flashbacks to the night. It is paralyzing to a point where I have to drop everything and seek warmth immediately. I feel like if I don’t, I could pass out and die.\n\nI can’t even go into a swimming pool anymore. Getting out of it is just so harsh to my body that I pass the experience altogether.\n\nAnyone else has experienced something like this? I don’t know what I can do to make it stop. Sorry if it’s a small problem compared to other stories I read here. Cheers.",

I was a senior in college, and this happened my last semester. It was one of the hardest moments of my life. I had so many panic attacks, I even had a panic attack in class because we were covering heart failure which hit too close to home because of all the damn stress. I was so embarrassed. I lost so much weight too. Just a constant feeling of doom, not knowing whether today they may not make it, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. And I kept getting worse and worse news. Having no support from friends, having to tough it out to not burden them and look too negative. Because when I opened up a little bit they didn’t care. I didn’t realize how much trauma my body held from this. \n\nBut I have another sick family member now, and I’m so scared. It triggers me seeing the flashing of the hospital monitors. When they beep, and there’s a warning of one of their vitals being too high or low. When you have to wait in suspense for some news, hoping that it isn’t bad. My heart rate shoots up super high. It’s just one thing after another. I’m going crazy. I just can’t handle this anymore. I’m an anxious mess. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. ",

        "Upvotes": 0,
        "Text": "\n\nWhat it is like to live with a spouse who has severe PTSD. First, I would like to state that I am writing this because neither myself or my wife are veterans. It seems like all the research I do almost always involves a veteran. Plus, it never really addresses what the non PTSD spouse goes through on a daily basis. You are going to need some background first.\n\nFirst though, you need to know recent shit. My wife was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, on August 31, 2024, stage IV, which has metastasized to her brain, bones and liver. She had surgery on her brain first. That tumor had already grown to 1.61x1.81x1.22 **inches** in size, there were a couple of small ones in other regions of the brain. She then had three bouts of targeted radiation. Then she started receiving the immunotherapy drug Keytruda as well as what will end up being 10 doses of targeted radiation on the incredibly large mass in her lung, that has grown into her rib cage, has ossified her first and second rib and has also invaded her liver which has two smaller ones. She has 5 treatments down, weekend off, then the last 5. By the way, that bastard measures 3.98x2.4x1.46 **inches**!\n\nA typical female liver averages 8.5” long, hers is 13.5”? Is the extra 5” good or bad? Can the doctors do a resection of the tumor and leave her enough to live? I read somewhere that the liver will regrow.\n\nI understand why she should be extremely tired, cranky and just bitchy all around. Then factor in her PTSD and her lack of being able to show (just me) any love, sympathy, empathy, anything that shows even a marginal of care for me.\n\nOkay, here comes a shit load of numbers,(for no real benefit). I like numbers because they don’t lie. Math is math. For the duration of my time on this planet, 62 years, 4 months, 3 weeks and 4 days, (22,794 days), I have been married for 36 years, 2 months, 1 week and 6 days, (13,223 days). Today, October 18, 2024 has without question been the worst day of my life. I know that what she is saying to me is not her. But she was extremely vicious and dug deep to just crush me.\n\nI was completely devastated. My heart, soul and just being were shredded, I told her I was going to bed while trying to hold back my emotions. When I got to my room I just had to let it out for about 5 hours. I had so many tears just streaming down my face I thought I was going to dehydrate.\n\nNever felt that, ever. I was heavily physically and mentally abused when I was young, and nothing my mother ever did to me made me feel as I felt last night. This woman was cruel, evil, soulless, an alcoholic and was born without a purpose in life\n\nNow, for the rest of the story…\n\nMy wife was a Para Teachers Assistant, (we used to call it special ed). She loved her job and was damn good at it. She worked for one of the local high schools, and the vast majority of these kids are never going to function in society. So many of them had no verbal skills, arrived by a special van with a nurse and could not even sit up or even move. I think the parents looked at it like state sponsored day care and just wanted a break from it all. The schools looked at it like a lot more money for trying to “teach” these kids. Which in my opinion was futile, it really was all about the money.\n\nDue to HIPPA laws she was not allowed to know anything about the kids. What exactly was their deficiency, their trigger points and their history? In September of 2020 she got the living shit beat out of her by one of these students. He was 6 feet tall and weighed about 200 pounds. He blew up in the classroom, threw one pregnant teacher across the room into the lockers, took a full grown man to the ground and then came at my wife. She did as trained and tried to talk him down until his handler could get there. He grabbed her and took her to the floor and the whole time was trying to bite her face, neck, whatever he could grab onto.\n\nHis handler shows up and gets him off of her and out of the classroom with my wifes help. She tells my wife that she is going to take off running and he will chase her. At that point my wife was to let go of him. When she did this he did not take off running but immediately turned on my wife and went back to try to bite her. My wife's fight or flight instinct did not have the time necessary to reset from the earlier attack. She has a hard time remembering how things happened, but she knows that she ended up on the floor again, and just trying to keep his mouth away from her body. He managed to bite her arm plenty deep enough to draw blood and she thinks she got kicked in the ribs at least a time or two before help came and got this kid off of her. Needless to say she was pretty shaken up and asked if she could go home. They let her do this and instructed her on where to go for medical treatment.\n\nShe arrived at home about 10:30 - 11:00 in the morning just hysterical, saying over and over “I got bit”.  I took her to the facility that the school said she had to go to and they treated her wound and rapped her ribs. They commented on how deep the wound from the bite was.\n\nMy wife tried to return to work the next day but after about an hour she had to leave. She did find out that she was the 22nd teacher that this student had assaulted. I think that that is information that should have been shared with anyone that was going to have interaction with him.\n\nIt has been over 4 years since the attack. She sees a therapist weekly and is making progress, slowly. For the longest time she could not be anywhere but home when it got dark. She can go to maybe half a dozen stores, all of which have a low concentration of people. She no longer cooks. I think there have been two meals she made since the beating.\n\nI had an episode where for 5 nights in a row I was doing really weird stuff. Like waking her up in the middle of the night with my coat and shoes on asking her if she is ready to go? She of course wasn’t going anywhere but I swear she told me to take her somewhere, this happened twice. One night I had a quasi dream that I had to beat two other people to the kitchen because I wanted the bread and butter. I woke up in the kitchen alone. Another time I woke up flailing my arms falling backwards. I managed to pull the curtains down and woke up on the floor with the curtain rod across my face and the curtains sprawled about. The last time I woke up in extreme pain and falling backwards. I landed on a couple of computer monitors and a kerosene heater, in my closet. I figured out that in my sleep I slammed my face into the chest of drawers that were in there, broke my nose and woke up falling.\n\nI went out and bought one of those sliding bolt locks for the bedroom door. I told my wife that after I go to bed to lock the door to the bedroom so I can’t get out of it because who knows what I might do. She refused to let this happen.\n\nThe next day I asked her to take me to the ER because I knew I couldn’t drive and she said she couldn’t. 3 - 4 hours later I came to her again and begged her to take me to the ER. I said I understand that she can’t come into the hospital with me, that she would if she could, but with how severe her PTSD is she would not be able to handle it. She could just drop me off and I would call her when I was done. So that is what we did. I ended up getting admitted, my blood oxygen level was 64% and the doctors and nurses were quite concerned. I knew I had COPD and it had progressed to this point rapidly. I now have supplemental oxygen 24/7 and for the most part I am doing ok about 80% of the time. The other 20% I feel like I am going to die because I just can’t catch my breath.\n\nThat is pretty much the back story, the following is what I go through daily. Let’s start with what I am either not allowed to say or do, and what she has said to me about how she feels:\n\n* Not allowed to lay on couch\n* Not allowed to say that I am tired\n* Not allowed to say I had a rough night sleeping\n* Not allowed to ask how her therapist meeting went. This I understand, she says it would be like asking her how her gynecologist exam went.\n* I am not allowed to make telephone calls while in the same room as her\n* I am not allowed to listen to music in the car or on the patio with her\n* I am not allowed in any part of the house except my bedroom at times. She has taken up camp in the living room, sleeping in an oversized recliner.\n* I am not allowed to comment on the amount of coffee she drinks, (12 - 15 cups a day) she says it doesn’t affect her. But most nights she gets 2 maybe 3 hours of sleep.\n* If I try to talk to her while she is listening to a trial on Youtube with her earbuds in, I get a real disgusted “what” from her.\n* Anything important she can’t talk about right now.\n* I am accused so many times of being a stressor to her\n* She has told me that she can’t feel empathy for me right now, or love.\n* She rarely shows me a sign of gratitude but will quickly point out something I did that stressed her or something that I didn't do and should have.\n* She doesn’t care that her choice of isolation has also dictated a life of isolation for me.\n* I figured out that I spend 22 hours a day on average in my room, she doesn't care.\n* Today it dawned on me that I don’t care if she gets pissed off at me, but every time she has to slip in a good helping heap of fuckin guilt. \n\nThere are so many more things, I used to have to text her when I was coming into the living room. This gives you a pretty good outline at least. I made a list just to help me remember the when, why, where I was supposed to do this, that or the other thing?\n\nOn my birthday I finally got the nerve up to cut a big skin tag off my ball sack. It was about as big as the end of your pinky finger and was on a nerve and sent a jolt through me anytime it rubbed against my boxers and I had to be real careful getting it out and putting it away when I went to the bathroom. I made sure to rub everything down with alcohol, even the scissors I used. Took a deep breath and told myself I just need 3 seconds of immense courage and snipped it off. I had no idea how much it would bleed. Three hours later I am still bleeding like I have never bled before. She got pissy because we had planned on meeting up with about 8 other family members for dinner. I told her I needed to go to the emergency room and get a couple of stitches. She got mad because I did this when I knew we were supposed to go to dinner with family members. She said once again that she couldn’t go and had our oldest daughter take me. I ended up with 7 stitches and a special clotting material affixed to it. She said that she would call the other people, two phone calls, and tell them that I was having a lung issue and was going to the ER. She told everybody exactly what happened, even though she knows that I don’t share personal information like that.\n\nNow here we are 4 days later and her father is in the same hospital because he is having a hard time catching his breath and one of his legs is giving him problems. She is planning on going there early in the morning to see him. Do you see the irony here? Had absolutely no compassion for me, for a situation that I think was a bit more serious and she couldn’t go to the hospital with me, I thought due to her PTSD, but somebody else and she’s gotta be there.\n\nOf course there is no closeness between us. I will rub her back and neck, tell her she looks nice, smells good when she wears my favorite perfume, I go to all of her doctor appointments with her, except her therapist, I went once. Yet, I get nothing in return except negative remarks. I get no physical contact from her which I need so badly. Just to have that human touch.\n\nI have no one I can talk to about anything. We have been together for 38 years, married for 36. I have zero friends and always put her before me. The highlight of any day is going to Wal-Mart and getting HER car washed.\n\nI handle all the bills now and if I see something strange in the online ledger I’ve learned that I am not supposed to ask her about it. She would get fixated with these online games and buy upgrade packages or some shit like that. She would spend $400 to as much as $600 a month on this, and that was money we just didn’t have with her no longer working. But, I can't talk to her about it. It’s always the same, I am stressing her out.\n\n\n\n**I am the stresser.**\n\n",

        "Text": "I don’t know why I’m making this post other than the need to vent. This happened months ago but I can’t shake the trauma it’s left me with. I’ve worked in the forest for years and encountered many bears but each time we went our separate ways with no issues. I got too comfortable following the usual advice to stand your ground and scare black bears away, since this always worked I guess I lost my fear. But early July I had a completely different experience that has left me with some obsessive trauma. \n\nI started work in the woods on a rainy day at 7am. By 8am I was an hours walk into a northern Ontario forest when I saw him. I was completely alone working with trees in vulnerable positions on my knees and such when I turned around and saw a black bear about 30 feet from me staring me directly in the eyes. This initial feeling wasn’t the scariest part but it’s the part I can’t move on from. The feeling of enjoying work to realizing something had been stalking me as prey and I had no idea. My heart dropped and I was in disbelief for a moment because this was already different than my other encounters. I’ve always seen the bear first and felt in control where as this thing already had the upper hand on me and totally snuck up on me. Despite initial shock I tried bluff charging it, yelling and waving my shovel. He slowed his pace but continued to stare me down and close distance.\n\nAs he emerged from the bushes now only about 15 feet from me I could tell it was a massive male black bear. The feeling of having complete control to feeling helpless and weaker than I’ve ever felt dawned on me. This is another part that I have trouble getting over, I’ve never felt so powerless in my life. Realizing that this bear saw me as food and clearly was not afraid of me I started backing up and tripping over logs. I slightly turned my back to see where I was going and that’s when the bear charged me full speed. I started sprinting and screaming for my life. This all happened so fast but basically it closed the gap between us until we were face to face. I turned on my radio and was begging for help from my coworkers and nearby truckers with no answer. I started swinging my shovel at the bear while he stood up and lunged at me with teeth and claws. I swung my shovel so fast just trying to keep space between us. I hit him once in the face with my spade as hard as possible and was shocked when the bear had zero reaction. Although he did slow back down to a walking pace at this point.\n\nThe next 60 seconds alternated between me running, the bear catching up and us showing off face to face and repeat. I accepted I was probably done for when eventually I heard a voice of a coworker answer my cry for help. This filled me with life and as soon as we joined together we managed to scare him away until we got back to the vehicles.\n\nThe memories are still so fresh and mostly what I can’t seem to move on from is the silence and cold black stare the bear had. He didn’t make a sound and was staring into my soul with those black eyes. I immediately knew I was prey and it was the predator with all the power. I think about this every day and don’t know how to accept this experience and move on.",

This was her response to me (actually in quite a vulnerable state) telling her I can't use use Headspace or Calm apps she likes because the speakers use a tone of voice which triggers physical and emotional flashbacks to the foundational trauma which laid the groundwork and gave me the trauma responses which ultimately led to me seeking out more trauma. She likes the Headspace & Calm apps, and that's great - but my response to the tones of voices used in them is to viscerally want to do the exact opposite of what they're saying, extreme rage, severe emotional upset, fight or flight, usually both. I use the Intellect app, and I like it, but she's quite \"these apps are the ones I trust so they're the only ones I want you using\" about it all. I also use YouTube tutorials and therapy channels, which she disapproves of.\n\n\nIdk. I just needed to rant about this, a little bit. I've recently managed to forgive my younger self for the behaviour which led to me experiencing trauma in my teens, I've forgiven my family members for their roles in it and their responses. I'm working on forgiving my current self. I've forgiven my childhood bullies. But I haven't forgiven the staff who caused me severe trauma from the ages of 3 to 11. Forgiving people who were also children at the time was something I done without really noticing it, until I realised my mother still hasn't forgiven them. However, forgiving full-grown adults who made the conscious choice to abuse me at that age... that is much, much harder, and I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet. I've partially forgiven the men who took advantage of my trauma in my teens, and its a work in progress, but I'm getting there, along with forgiving that version of myself for having that trauma response. However, my trauma response to the tone of voices used in the Headspace & Calm apps is directly rooted in the abuse I suffered from adults when I was 3 to 11, and my mother is aware of that. However, she doesn't see it as trauma - just something unpleasant i went through. I felt very dismissed and pushed to the side and ignored when she essentially said \"it was years ago, just get over it\" when I know it's my nervous system I need to heal along with my inner child, and that is very difficult to do when I have a level of amnesia surrounding my life prior to being 16. Add in memory loss from malnutrition via anorexia and severely bad mental health throughout my teens, and I have a lot of memory gaps throughout my life. I know my memory was eidetic when I was a child, though, and I have the feeling the severity of my current amnesia is linked to how deeply embedded the memories are / were. I think i would've liked her to acknowledge this, on some level. But she pretty much told me to get over it.",

Then I was sexually assaulted when I was 17, then a combat deployment happened. I'm currently back in school and working as a medical receptionist, but those 3 things very much affect me to this day, which is what got me diagnosed with PTSD. \n\nIs it possible to have PTSD from more than one traumatic event?

Dissociation has been the hardest and worst symptom to try and get rid of. The only emotion I felt for years was anger.\n\nIn spring, the dissociation broke, and I felt overwhelmed with grief and anxiety. But I cared about the future for the first time in such a long, long time.\n\nI gradually reestablished ties with some family members with the very strict boundary that the person who caused my ptsd is not to be near me.\n\nTwo weeks ago, this person just happened to drop by when he knew I was visiting a family member, and he entered the house. The family member who opened the door didn't try and stop him, despite knowing the situation. \n\nI lost my shit. I was hysterical-- I ran out the front door and had a breakdown. Some family members had no idea of the context-- so I just looked insane as I waited for an uber in my socks.\n\nEverything I thought I had worked through has come rushing back. Dissociation. Nightmares. I've been alternating between crying and rage. And I feel simultaneously that I am a garbage person who deserves to be treated like garbage, and that everyone else in the world is fundimentally bad.\n\nI feel so, so hopeless. I had made so much progress and it's all gone.\n\nAnd the worst part is that I gave him the satisfaction of knowing he still has power over me. I'm still scared of him and I hate myself for it.\n\nI can't live like this. Please, give me hope. ",

Just hiding dry foods and drinks in places only I check, like drawers and dressers. I could freely keep all my food in the kitchen and I don't really have to worry about someone taking the food that I bought but it just doesn't feel *safe*\n\nI stash anything that won't expire or break. Hardtack, trail mix, protein bars, instant soup that I eat dry, prepackaged croissants,loads of flavored water- just anything that will last when left in room temperature and doesn't have a noticeable smell. And if the packaging is too crinkly or over all loud I put everything in plastic containers, like empty containers after butter etc, because even if I know I'm the only person around, too much noise spikes my anxiety or just deters me from reaching for food completely. I even kept military rations packs for a while until I got paranoid that the \"cooking heat packs\" are too noticeable and ridiculous to use when I have a stove just a room away. \n\nI brushed the hoarding off as me being too lazy to move to get food, but keeping everything close also reminds me that I need to eat since I've got issues with recognizing when it's time to have a meal. \n\nDo many people hoard the emergency foods for no reason? I feel like I'm insane for doing that so it'd be nice to know if other people do this too. This whole living past trauma is stressful as hell",

Now, I recoil even more and freeze up whenever I hear a kissing noise. Especially my parents. I can’t stand it makes me nauseous and I shut down. That’s 100% one of my triggers.

I had a sad and lonely childhood and was often subjected to emotional abuse and physical one sometimes too, however, I don't have any memories related to sexual abuse, but for some reason when I start thinking about it, it leaves me with a very uneasy feeling. Adding to that, I've felt all my life that something was wrong with me and it all paints such a strange picture that I can't stop thinking about\nSo this also led me to wonder whether something might have happened to me as a child but I just don't remember it? I've heard of such cases but I don't understand how often this happens. That's probably why I'm writing this, maybe someone has experienced something similar, I don't know\n\n",

The new guy wanted to go even further and scope out other parts but I knew that shit was mined. \n\nLong story short we go to leave and as we're driving man I don't know how to describe but this house next to us just fucking explodes. \n\nI remember seeing two people outside and when I looked back it's just black smoke and burning embers. These people are fucking done.\n\nI should have died that day. That was most likely meant for us and we were the target.\n\nI should have said at first it was stupid, but I didn't think of it and I should have known better.\n\nFallowing that after the explosion I should have got out and helped and I didn't. \n\nI think of that happening everyday. I relived that event so may times. \n\nI can't even describe the shock of being nearly blown up like that. \n\nI feel so guilty I didn't stop and help but what the fuck am I gonna do after the fuck they fucking blew up. You're not putting a tourniquet on a fucking dude charcoaled up and moosh.\n\nI wonder why them and not me, what if we didn't go, yeah that village got bombed a lot and they should have left or joined the military but the longer I've been back the more I feel like I'm partly or completely responsible for getting them killed. \n\nSometimes I've drinken to forget and sometimes I've drinken to forget have fun but when I've gotten drunk and emotional that's all I can think about and I want to drink more.\n\nSometimes I'm just having fun and I don't want it to stop so I'm alone with my thoughts again.\n\nI can't answer the thoughts in my head but this is definitely a piece of why I get drunk.\n\nI remember doing work and the artillery would come closer. The explosion sound was never an issue it’s the shock wave and the feeling of just having no power against it. I can’t describe. Imagine a guess of wind traveling kilometers after an impact. Artillery and gun shots don’t bother me from the sound but the feeling of the ground and wind if just ungodly and nerving. \n\nI used to do a deliver to one village and it was a small village right before the front. I remember seeing this most beautiful girl with her child. Her husband apparently died in the war so she took care of her kid alone. A week after I left that village was bombed and her house is gone and she and her kid is probably dead. \n \nI went to zaporizhzhia some days and drove to the work area from there a bit. I remember seeing a child in crutches because he had been injured. \n\nTheirs not a day that’s goes by I don’t see something that remind me. Every Ukraine flag I see on a car brings me back and sometimes it’s good memories but sometimes it’s this stuff I think about.\n\nI don’t know who would have read to this point.",

Anyone else with Ptsd and a newborn?\n\nI've struggled with ptsd for years, but this year was particularly bad and I just started trying to go to the VA for it which has been a fucking nightmare. I wanted to try and get better before the kid came but my community care therapist (who i had to drive 1.5 hours to see because no one near me was taking new patients) literally made me feel more suicidal so I stopped seeing her. With the nightmare that is trying to find a new therapist in the first place, I called the VA who told me there's a 9 month waiting list with the hospital to get someone. Only on an antianxiety medication mainly cause of fear during the med rebalancing phase with antidepressants when another vet friend who almost committed suicide during it but I but the bullet and contacted my VA psychiatrist to start that process (funny how getting meds is way fucking easier than getting therapy).\n\nI'm absolutely losing it with having a new kid. 6 week old and these feelings have been escalating. Objectively, I know my kid is absolutely normal and there is nothing wrong. But her crying triggers the fuck out of me. Tonight I snapped and lost it. I was wearing her in a harness as me and my wife take shifts at night, bottle was heating up, and she just kept crying. I had to just calmly somewhat lightly hit my fist against the wall to concentrate on something besides the crying while the bottle heated up. Wife came out rightfully worried and concerned and asked me to stop and I just lost it. I just hit the wall harder while still wearing my kid, I just snapped. I took the kid out of the harness, gave her to the wife and just had to bash my head against the wall to get back to a more stable place. I know it's not normal and not ok, but it's what I needed to do in the moment to snap out of it (just concentrating on one intense stimulus which I have decent control over). I screamed at my wife all the suicidal shit I've been holding in my head. I still do think my wife and kid would be better without me.\n\nI immediately called the suicide hotline. I'm sorry to say it did not help and they just sent another referral in to the VA for Monday. I was able to get a hold of another vet friend to talk to. I use to work in hospitals, and I am absolutely adverse going to the Emergency Department for help (same with inpatient).\n\nParental leave is coming to an end as well but imagining going back to work with this seems like a nightmare (new job as well so I don't have FMLA protecting it).\n\n",

There was a point he made that it would have been better if I had studied something during the 3-month vacation instead of just \"enjoying,\" which hurt me a lot because I was working on my trauma during those 3 months. It was the hardest thing for me to take a break from the constant cycle of study and feeling overwhelmed. This fear productivity allowed me to get into top 10 and I felt afraid that if I fix my trauma I will lose it. But I finally decided that this suffering was too much for me and that I didn't want to live like that, I worked on my trauma, almost finished The Body Keeps the Score, gained a lot of internal understanding, did lots of journaling, yoga, and other things. Trauma was coming out with full intensity; I couldn't sleep at night, my hands kept shaking, and every day I woke up with a sense of depression, feeling like I can't do the things I love, and that I couldn't move forward toward my dream. I felt jealous of people who worked for it. I was walking on a dark road not even sure if I would even heal or not. As my circumstances were I couldn't afford therapist. I knew this study gap will fk me up a little, but I also knew that it was important, even if no one understood me and thought it was me being lazy. A critical part of me also thought I was just doing this to avoid the hardships of life. I felt afraid of what I would do when I went back to university after this much time gap. But I had no other options. After many days, I started to see results, and now I am very healed—not fully, but very. In recent exams I performed very well without sacrificing my mental health. And now when someone summarizes something like this, that a part of me still is conflicted and afraid of, as \"enjoyment,\" it breaks me.",

SA :( and stuff, so heads up ig?\n\nhere we go anyways.\n\nthis is going to be a long one so I do apologize.\nI 21(f) need some help understanding how I should feel about this-\nto start, \nI should explain my confusion.\n\nI am severely autistic\n\n(while undiagnosed because i like haveing rights as an independent adult human being) \n- \"high functioning\" and its not even funny. \nbut nothing on paper.\nno less the tism runs through my veins \nand I mention it because-\n\nI have trouble with... \nunderstanding how I should feel about things-  \nespecially emotionally charged things like events or trauma.\neven more especially given I was raised to be forgiving and to always turn my cheek the other way, and have lived that way since I moved out at 17\n\nwhich is the problem.\nbecause I am also a veteran, (remember undiagnosed)\nnothing hard-core, mostly signal stuff and low physical work force. \nI mention this because this whole thing was while I was enlisted. \n\nI have only been out for about 9 to 10 ish months due to being medboarded for injuries.\nbut what happened has been...\nbothering me to say the least but I can't make heads or tails why or if it should be. and I'm worried that I am simply dwelling and overreacting?\n\nenough padding I'll just get into the story-\n\nabout last year (2023) I was stationed in state, I had recently left Korea and had been riding the coattails of my 21st birthday near the beginning of that previous December.\n\nwhich if you know what a combination of those 2 things means. \nI was very new to alcohol.\n\nwhen I got to my new station there were a few bumps that let to my units shaping a few people around, like raid parties threatening to have a gate named after you.\n\nso after that and about a half of the year, \ni was getting to my new unit which is where I met the person in this story.\n\nlets call him \"guy\" M(22)\nme and guy™️ got along pretty well, especially given the fact he was more simular to me then most anyone else there.\nme and guy were both on profiles, me for lower bilateral leg injuries and him for I belive back issues,\nso even though our mos(jobs) were pretty different, neither of us could move our heavy equipment-\nmeaning we both often ended up doing the jobs that thay gave to us and the other profiles.\n\nbasically, we hung out alot during work, and then after we would hang out with others guys who were also on profiles because there was that shared kinship with us at his place,\n \nI fit in because I grew up with a bunch of guys and pretty much grew up as one myself- so I liked all the games they played and was more then competitive enough to keep up with them.\n\nso this pretty much becomes our schedule for the next few months.\nme and Guy hanging out, \"shooting the shit\" as they say, going over to his or the other guy's place for games n what not-\nbut over all I didn't drink alot during those times.\n\neventually we agreed that everyone just going to Guy's place would work best because it was closer to our company, and then the hangouts stayed there.\n\nthen the issues happened.\n\nduring that time I started drinking more to help me fit in with the group- even when they started to leave, I kept it up because social interaction feels alot less terrible if I play along.\n\nnothing too crazy but with a bunch of rowdy drunk guys playing video games over the weekend, you tend to over look a few things, \nwhich that being even while still buzzed, I did catch that any physical contact that would normally happen, you know like pile ups, bumping your shoulder into the other guy, joking hugging as a bit or to weird the other guy out, etc, \nand a bunch of men chanting \"Go white girl, go\" \"Go white girl, go\" as I shot gun 3 beers \nand what not \n\nbut guy™️'s hands kinda reached a lil lower then the others, which... in hindsight is a big red flag, but I pretty take the blame there because even though we were gaming and drinking, unlike the others who were basically in shorts and t-shirts, I still wore stuff that made me feel decent and pretty- you know like how girls are supposed to (?) (again- still painfully tistic)\n\nso, I pretty much called it up to either mistakes, missing some social que or just my fault because what should I expect ig.\n\nbut it kept going, and as the other guys started to dwindle, mostly due to their own medboards getting them out Scott free. \nGuy would encourage me to drink more- \"to keep up the energy n what not.\"\nwhich again, a big red flag in hindsight, but I am pretty much blind when it comes to foresight.\naround that time my doc even suggested I also medboard given my condition was not getting better.\n\nand eventually it was just me and guy™️, getting drunk and playing video games, which with him pretty much being my only friend left, I didn't have much else to do on the weekends anyways.\n\nbut he started encouraging me to drink more and more, meaning I got alot more wasted. and he while drinking with me would drink alot less (ANOTHER RED FLAG but one I think I may have intentionally overlooked because I thought it was normal)\n\nand then it started.\nI woke up back at my own place, after being black out drunk, with a terrible migrane, and a really sore mouth..... \napparently while I was drunk... yeah.\nwhich, I pretty much thought in the back of my head for a while but like all my other fears or confusions I have with people, things that happened, and over all unpleasantness.\nI pushed it to the back of my mind, especially because it was Monday and I didn't have time to think about anything like that.\n\nI should mention here now if not had earlier, but dispite the red flags, Guy was still pretty much my only friend left, and had been nothing but kind and supportive- often helping me with things I didn't quite get- helping me with certain social cues, and over all nothing questionable or overtly uncomfortable during the work week or anything like that.\nwe even were rather personally close because we had talked about our previous traumas- like his families issues and my previous trauma of getting groomed.\n\nbut then the next weekend the worst happened and the thing that is pretty much why this whole wall of text is here in the first place.\nand again \n\n///this is not fun stuff so like, turn back now or somthin if you don't wanna read this stuff\\\\\\\\\n\nbut yeah.\nwith the previous weekend a blure and way too busy and stressful given we had to do alot of practicing for an upcoming mission.\nso with the implied questionable blackout far beck in my head repressed and forgotten, I missed another red flag.\n\nthis hangout felt off, even in comparison from the previous ones, but I am used to pushing off that anxiety because I have always felt anxious when it comes to socializing.\nand things went as normally as the hang outs go, except we had alot more liquor then usual,\nGuy even chanting the nostalgic \"go white girl go\" (hah....) encouraging me to chug stuff.\n\neven as alarm bells started ringing in my head, I was way too inebriated to do anything...\nand next thing I new I was pushed onto his bed.\nand he had pulled out a rubber.\nI'm sure we can all figure out what happened next.\n\nI remember every. bit of it. my mind almost imidiatly sobered up but I couldn't do anything to move my body. I felt weak, my limbs were impossibly heavy, I was face down onto a mattress, crying but it was muffled and I pretty much had to be stuck there, unable to do anything.\nit went on untill he was done and had left the room to go wash up.\nand I pretty much went fetal.\n\nwhen ever he came back, he saw the state I was in and then probably realized how bad this looked.\nso he pretty much sat me up, got me repressed and started apologizing, begging and saying that was an accident and he didn't realize  what he had done and that we are both clearly drunk.\n\nit was terrifyingly genuine.\nand heres my problem....\ni can't tell.\nthis event (and the next one.) (yeah there's more because im an idiot) \nhas basically been in my head ever since.\nI think even I could tell it has traumatized me- to the point where any time I even think of remembering him or things we used to do I feel ill and my stomach feels like it's tied in knots...\nbut I can't help but think it's my fault too... \nthere were so many red flags, so many things that any normal person should have seen and whiped out the whistle and ran the other way, but I just didn't notice I felt like it was just normal guy things and then boom.\n\nanyways\n\nhe \"helped\" me get dressed-\nfrom there everything was a blur.\nthe next day my primary health provider told me I would be getting medically discharged bythe middle of the folowing month, and I was told to start the medboard discharge prossess.\n\nI was essentially a walking zombie, going from point a to b.\nI started drinking more on my own just to get through the night and not be alone with my thoughts \n(I know, the last thing you should do)\n\nmy brain tried to blur out what happened, and even when I though about going to my chain of command I remembered just how painful the discharge prossess can get with any delay.\nI just wanted to leave.\n\nand with everyone else ready for a mission, it was me going to do the stuff with who ever they had available to help.\nthat being those on profile.\nmeaning I was stuck with guy following me everywhere for the next month.\n\nI was blank, I was so focused on just leaving that I didn't even had time to think about what happened, I try to push it to the back of my mind, but it was always there, and guy pretty much either trying to save face or out of genuine compassion had been acting like his typical self, being as helpful as he used to be, making jokes like how we used to and helping me find my way around base when I got lost trying to find where to go next.\n\nand as everything came and went, it was the next month.\nI guess I fully repressed it because things felt normal again, even made friends with the new guys who joined the profile group, and as we got closer to my deadline I felt comfortable hanging out either people.\n\nguy being there was inevitable because i hadent told a soul and was way too stressed and busy to confront what happened, \nso ofcourse all of the fellow \"cripple crew\" as one of our new guys dubbed us, drinking was unavoidable cus army plus my drinking becoming a problem, but I made sure that I wouldn't be alone with guy, (who had now become a borderline alcoholic too ig)\n\nwell. that didn't work too well because only a week away \nwe had a fairwell party for me, \nand ofcourse, it was at guys place because it was close to our company.\n-\nI let my drinking catch up with me, I wasn't black out, but, I didn't notice that everyone else had left.\nand as I was getting my stuff from the bathroom to leave I was pretty much stopped on my way out by guy.\n\nand I pretty much froze.\nand everything floded back.\nI wasn't ready for this, I knew I had to be careful but I slipped up and now I was pretty much in danger.\n\npretty much the next thing I know I was hand tied to a bed with a ethernet cable as he pretty much started... groping-\nnow. \nam I an idiot- very much so, \nbut i wasnt mentally ready to avoid him everywhere like i should have...\nI was so used to seeing him everywhere every day that untill I was in danger I didn't even mentally register that these were the same man...\n\nso another thing thats my fault ig..., but I did do somthing this time- before anything could else happen i pretty much kept kicking him off of me and even tho my throat froze up and I couldn't speak (because panic attacks suck) I kept pushing him off and was crying, but It didn't fully stop him cus he got the upper hand on me and started... removing clothing.\n\nafter... alot of indignity but no penetraition, it's almost like he came to what was happening.\nhe muttered somthing and drunkenly put what he taken off of me back om.\nas soon as he untied me, I made a straight run for the bathroom.\n\n\nI locked the door behind me and pretty much broke down...\nafter throwing up in the toilet twice I sat down, back against the door for what felt like forever...\nI was just one week away from here, to freedom.\nso I just, sat there... and waited and waited.\n\nafter a while I grabbed my things i had dropped, and left the bathroom, he was just, sitting on his bed, staring at the wall.\n\nso I pretty much as quietly as I could made a break for the door, he didn't follow or even look at me.\n\nfor the next week i was a shell.\nmy brain has been a wreck since, but that week was hell.\nmy mind just played everything on repeat, I blamed myself for kitting it happen again, and I noticed all the red flags from before, I wanted to leave the army and never look back, all my paper work was done, but the stress was even more pressing because I had to move all my stuff in the next 4 days, hell on the next day they already had another guy being moved into my place, so I had to move all my stuff out, either a random e4 living there with me for 3 of those days as I tried to find a place to leave my stuff.\n\nand what would you know, my chain of comman had the brilliant idea of having Guy temporarily hold my stuff till I was finalized \"because you guys are best friends and what not, dw your battle buddy has enough room\".....\n\nso yeah.\n\nwe pretty much loaded my stuff into my car but I made sure I had another person with me, under the premise of my injuries and my stuff being far too heavy and I got the hell out of there.\n\n\n\n\nso.\n\n10ish months later and this is pretty much where we are today.\nI know I should have informed my chain of command, and  it's likely going to haunt me for the rest of my life that I didn't do somthing, especially because he's already gotten out due to medboard aswell so I can't do anything about it now.\n\nbut there lies my problem.\nI am haunted by these events in episodes, I can go at most a few days with it pushed out of my mind- especially with how busy I am in civilian life, but then I remember and feel all of this stuff again.\n\nI. don't know how to feel.\nwhat happened has left me scared but there were so many things I could have done to avoid it, I could have gotten retribution, I could have done this or that, a million things.\n\nbut I didn't. and somehow I can sometimes go a day or two or three and be normal- not moody or have panic attacks, even my drinking has become far more normalized and I bearly do it, maybe a drink or two monthly.\nI feel I deserve this pain, or that because it was so avoidable that maybe subconsciously I wanted this?\nor the fact I can go days normally that maybe in just over reacting...??\ndo I forgive him for all the kindness he's done for me and just hate what he did???\n\nI don't know how I should feel.\nthat's always been my problem, growing up I had to be told how things make people feel, and that's what I've based my understanding on.\nbut i don't know what to do here....\n\nplease. any help or advice. anything.\nthankyou for putting up with this massive wall of text and I sincerely apologize for any discomfort I've brought.\n\nso.\n\ntldr: \nI was in the army and got assaulted twice by my bestfriend, I'm free now but am far too autistic to understand how to feel about this and I am begging for help.",

        "Text": "I moved back to my hometown where my two abusers live(d). One died this year, god bless, the other one I think lives in the same neighborhood. I had two different men groom and abuse me between the ages of 7-15. The guy who is probably alive was my neighbor and had done the most violent acts to me while his daughter and my sister were in the room during our sleepovers in the middle of the night. The dead dude was my golf coach in high school, and he was just insane gropey. My ptsd had always centered around sleep, insomnia, anxiety around sleeping, who’s in the house, who’s awake/is actually asleep, etc. insomnia quickly deteriorates my mental functioning too, I can’t function knowing what I get to look forward to at night. When I do end up sleeping, it’s never more than 6 hours, it’s always around 5am or so when I do crash out, and I usually am taking hydroxyzine and cannabis products. I wasn’t this bad until I came home a few weeks ago. I believe this has regressed my behaviors to those of my childhood/teen years. And this is a living hell. I know why I was the way I was now, I empathize with why I was such a bitch as a teen. I have so much fear in this house and town. I never feel safe. I’m so scared I don’t even know what to do. I’m not going to hurt myself or anyone, I’m just scared to sleep or really do anything. I’m not sure what to even do for myself or who could help with this shit. Talking about it doesn’t do much. I almost have a plain affect when discussing the physical trauma vs when talking about the emotional and mental impact. But I’m scared of the physical stuff and maybe the intermittent emotional impact? Idk man, this shit is bananas. Idek how to move on from this period of my life, I’m just going to be stuck in these memories forever, or it just feels that way. ",

        "Text": "My spouse M73 has PTSD from childhood trauma. He is also recovering alcoholic, 10 yrs sober. I  have so many questions and suspicions about his diagnosis. It was suggested to me by a career therapy patient friend that perhaps he had PTSD, maybe 15 yrs ago. That resonated with him but he did nothing  about it, he was drinking still at that time. \n\nThen he got sober and wore a PTSD bracelet for a while. Then decided he didn't want to be defined that way any longer, took off bracelet after wearing for several years, never to wear it again. He seemed more accepting of his situation (mental problems) while he wore it.  I need to add, I have noticed that he gets caught up in the newest ideas or something that sounds 'cool' to him. Even if someone uses an interesting word, he'll find a way to insert that word into his vocabulary the next 2 weeks.  It's like he was really impressed by it and wants it for himself. Someone at his meetings did  namaste  (prayerful pose, bowing) and he did that for a couple  of weeks. Someone talked to him about Zen Buddhism, bam, he is suddenly intrested...for 2 weeks. Makes him look thoughtful and intelligent, he thinks, because he was raised by a mother and system where, by God, you had better be the perfect children and not fuck up, be the smartest, have the best posture, get all the awards, be class president, be altar boy, make no fusses ever, make your mother proud!  Meanwhile he was abused at home and Dear Saint Mother did nothing and she knew of it, because he confronted her. She just made herself to be the victim and said she thought his siblings would kill him if she tried to stop them. So she got a pass. I told the therapist about it and it wasn't until then that he started to face what his mother did. \n\nHe did a heavy duty legit personality test where the therapist said she was surprised he was not a criminal or in prison. I took this to mean he may be psychotic. I have suspected that about him, but just not criminal intentions. Highly manipulative. I have long (for decades) thought he narcissistic. Fits the mold to a \"T\". \n\nHe's been thru many therapists. I don't know how far he gets with them before he quits them. He gets defensive when I ask any question. I suspect he has either fooled them long enough, or therapist gets too close.  Every therapist has been 'the one' and then somehow, spouse drifts off, declaring he doesn't need therapy anymore. I will add that during our 40 plus year marriage, he insisted we were having 'marriage problems' and did blame me for so many things.  Every therapist we went to lasted for a little while, and truth be told, I just gave up because even the therapist believed when I said something about his drinking. He was called out on a few things, he admitted to these things, but never, until he did his 12 steps did he ever make amends to me. Our marriage is only on paper now. I have been wanting to leave for years but I have it made where we live, i.e. I get to do what I want, except have a boyfriend. I miss the sex. I'm 9 years younger. \n\nHe is sour, critical, sarcastic, moody most of the time. When he visited our daughter in June, he came back a different person. He was happy and was actually enjoyable to be around. I started to think that maybe we could make this work. \n\nThen I took a trip early October for a week and when I came home, I was sick with Covid. And then last night I had to go to  emergency clinic for something else, not life threatening and not covid related. He was sighing deeply and miserable the whole time in the clinic, saying things like he made a big mistake coming early to appointment (I thought I could get in if I clocked in early, clinic was too busy for that on this day).   Now he has gone back to being sour and critical, non communicative, etc.   He doesnt' like taking  care of me when I'm sick. As long as he is in the house, that's as good as it gets. He does ask how I am feeling.  He will shop for me and get soup. He's great about shopping for me, always. He will do just about anything I ask of him, but I don't ask much of him.  I still cook meals, prepare snacks, grocery shop a little but I volunteer and have an active social life, so he does most grocery shopping. \n\nJust now he got up from a nap and seemed ok. He is going for a walk. If he hurts his back, he is in an even worse funk  and is grumpier and comes at me more  than usual to me.  I'm not grumpy when I get sick. I just am not having fun but still have my sense of humor. I'm extrovert, he is the exact opposite. No friends. None. Zero.   Does not like most people and criticizes the smallest thing, even people on TV aren't safe from his criticism Hair, voice, clothes. you name it. I'm low brow because I like The 3 Stooges and funny cat videos.  He spends his days playing on line card or chess, reading politics, watching political things, or seeing how our money is spent.  We're pretty low maintenance. I cut my own hair, do not do salons, more of a boho casual dresser. He kinda looks for cans of worms to open too.  \n\nToday I am feeling so much better. I usually go out one night  on the weekends.  He asked me about my plans for the day and I said I haven't been asked out yet for tonight by my friends, but it would depend on what it is. He said, let's say you were asked to go to your usual place, would you go? I want to see how responsible you are. I must say, he has been showing signs the past month or so of being controlling again. Do this, do that. Or he'll start to tell me what to do, stop and say never mind, don't want to tell you what to do. When he already did just that. He has a strong history of manipulation, not just with me but his children as well. One daughter barely speaks to him, gray rocks him, and the other he successfully brainwashed her to think he's Mr. Wonderful, but in reality he is spiritually abusive and manipulative. Quoting the bible to her and shit like that, when he knows that is her soft spot.  I mean if he is so spiritual, why doesn't he behave that way all the time, not just with her or people he is trying to impress with his headiness? \n\nI see him for the basic good man he is, yet he is  phony, I see that too. I feel sorry for him that he has really never been happy, he had a wife (me) who loved him madly and he drove me away by trying to break me and he was almost successful but I got into AlAnon and learned the problem was not just him. I was part of the problem too. I allowed his behavior, fought back, said mean things. So I learned to live my own life and here we are. We get along for the most part.\n\nI do miss male companionship, desperately. I do not want to have sex wtih him, the thought of him doing things to me turns my stomach. I'm still young, attractive, fun. I've been flirted with and just recently a man asked me if I'm married. I said yes but if my sister was not there, I think I would have committed adultery that night. \n\nI still feel bad for him because he seems constitutionally unable to kick and work thru his issues. He has the head knowledge...he can remember and repeat anything he reads or sees on TV, or hears from people. He just can't seem to make anything stick and put these things he sees/hears to action, or for very long. The only thing he's been truly able to do, is quit drinking. \n\nt's very frustrating for me, but I do feel sorry for him that he just can't seem to move off square 1. \n\nHe does take welbutrin for depression but since this latest therapist told him he has PTSD, I have researched what meds for him  to take and welbutrin is not one that treats PTSD.  That's not to say he might still need it for depression but I've asked spouse if he needs meds tweaked. I've been told to mind my own business.  He takes a shitton of supplements. Eyes, blood, prostate health, high blood pressure, also several prescriptions but sooo many supplements. I have not said anything to him about the amount of supplements but I remember when I took a lot during the new supplements phase, 30 yrs ago or so, I felt like shit. \n\nI brought up divorce and he told me we would pay 40% to the tax man if that happened. I told him I looked into it, and he isn't correct. We wouldn't lose a penny to Uncle Sam. Divorce is not a taxable event.  I think he fact checked me, because that's about the time he started being decent to live with. That and the trip to our daughter, they came about the same time. \n\nWill this PTSD ever be resolved? I think he enjoys being miserable, a victim. And he wants me to walk down that road with him, and I just won't. \n\n",

        "Text": "(edit: I hope I used the right flair, I'm not super familiar with Reddit haha)\n\nAfter many many years of therapy and treatment, I feel arguably even more resilient than before \"what happened.\" A while back, my therapist and I were talking about \"giving back\" so to speak. I've come a long way in my healing, and I like to help others. Plus, I'm trying to get out of my current field and I think it would help my resume. So, in that sense it almost feels like a win-win, at least on paper.\n\nDespite all my growth though, I cry pretty easily when hearing others stories. I'm not sure I'd be a great fit if I get upset while someone else is in a crucial moment and needs stability. At the same, it would be one way to strengthen my resilience, but the consequences seem pretty daunting if I mess up. I don't want anyone to get hurt or feel more isolated because I couldn't be strong enough to carry them through a moment of crisis.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience volunteering with crisis agencies or similar places? Do you have advice for doing that kind of work with and/or recovered from PTSD?",

It was my first and only relationship and it lasted three years.  He was very controlling, emotionally and psychologically abusive, and coerced me to have sex with him almost daily. I’ve been in therapy for four years to try and work through this.  I have only been on a handful of dates and have difficulty with intimacy of any kind and on any level with men. \n\nSuddenly, I meet a new guy at work. I think he is so cute. “Whoa…I think he’s cute”. I haven’t felt attraction towards someone since leaving my ex. For a second, I was kinda impressed that I felt that way, and had this moment of being pleased and proud of how far I’ve come. When I started ptsd treatment, I couldn’t even look at my male therapist. It took me months. Now, four years into treatment, I find someone attractive. This is a good thing, right? \n\nWrong. I am terrified. I know that on paper, this is progress and I should be feeling nothing but happiness!  Instead, I feel like I’m walking closer and closer to something dreadful.  Has anyone else felt like this before??? \n\n",

        "Text": "TW: references to physical/emotional abuse and neglect\n\nI have a very odd relationship with the PTSD/CPTSD label. I’ve been in therapy for years (love it) but when I was about 12 or 13, my therapist assessed me for PTSD pertaining to a specific event that had happened recently. I remember her saying something about how I met the criteria, except I hadn’t presented symptoms long enough. On top of that, I didn’t even feel the symptoms in relation to that event - I felt it in relation to my parents. So I did not walk away with a diagnosis.\n\nMy second therapist immediately caught onto my family life, and when I brought up how my previous therapist very briefly looked into PTSD, she empathetically told me that if she were to do the same, I would probably meet the criteria for a diagnosis. Still didn’t get diagnosed, but we focused heavily on my relationship with my parents.\n\nI have memories of trying to describe arguments to her, and feeling very strange. I’ve had panic attacks, but it was as if all of my symptoms were invisible or internal. She would ask me to describe what I was feeling and I couldn’t give an answer. The words wouldn’t come out. I thought I would burst out sobbing, but at most, only a few tears would slip out. I could only stare somewhere in the room and feel overly conscious of how shaky I felt, how my head felt like it was swimming, how my heart was pounding, how heavy my chest was. I was practically unresponsive.\n\nMy current therapist explained to me that diagnoses are really only shorthand for professionals, really only necessary like if she needed to transfer me to another therapist. She doesn’t refute my concerns about PTSD, but she’s never directly confirmed them. I think this makes me feel uneasy because my first therapist initially refused to diagnose me with ANYTHING saying it’d look bad on my resume (terrible). But my current one has also focused heavily on my childhood trauma, recognizing how it influences my thinking today, acknowledging the inner child in me that was never given proper attention, who was hurt. We will be doing an ART session soon. I very much trust her, but feel somewhat mixed feelings. But I believe that may be due to my own hypervigilance, if I had to put a word to it. And it seems like she’s actually been treating my PTSD(?) the entire time I’ve been with her.\n\nMy parents had an argument some time ago. My mom remarried my stepdad who I love to BITS over a decade ago. They are happily married. He’s safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and I did the most impulsive thing I’ve ever done in my life. While they wouldn’t notice, I took my car and drove to a nearby park, stopped in a quiet street and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren’t safe anymore, and my family was going to split apart again. The danger of being on my own couldn’t compare to the danger of my house. I made myself sit down for a meal somewhere before returning home with a birthday gift for my brother, where things were fine and healthy.\n\nWhen I tried to recount this day to my therapist, I was the most distraught I’d ever been in a session for a very long time. I felt the same things as I mentioned earlier, and what always stands out to me with these kinds of things is how I just can’t seem to talk. I could feel the words on my tongue but I couldn’t say them. And when I finally did, it was through uncontrollable crying. I barely felt like I was sitting on her couch there. All I could say was that I felt like I needed to run away.\n\nI asked her how she would describe what happened to me in that session from her perspective. In my head I was wondering if this is what a flashback or a triggered state would look like, but she used some different terminology. She said that my hysteria (she reassured me it only meant that my response was out of proportion for the situation, which is true. lol) was probably because my body recognized the stimuli from my traumatic memories (yelling, anger, smells, sounds, etc) and acted as if it was happening now - because these memories become storied in the body (she said somatic memory) and get recalled under similar circumstances.\n\nI know this is an absolute wall of text, so thank you to anyone who reads this far. Does anyone have similar experiences? I would love to hear peoples’ insight. I’m very proud of how much growing I’ve done, but having specific words to understand my experiences and responses would bring a great deal of comfort to me.",

        "Text": "    So me (19F at the time) and my ex boyfriend (20M t the time) dated for about 4 months. We were friends at first but slowly feelings started to develop and we decided to try dating. At first everything was going fine, but I started to notice his strange behavior over time.\n    \n    For example, once when I was at his place, we were drinking coffee with his parents (yes he STILL lives with his parents) and I noticed that he was sitting at the table with his knees against his chest and holding them in his arms kinda like sitting in the fetal position. I get it that it's his house but personally I see that as being disrespectful. Like I would try to behave somewhat normally if I had guests over. Also he would just stare at me for no reason for a really long time. Secondly I noticed that he treated me like I was his mother. Wanted me to take care of him and console him and hug him and kiss him every single second when we were together. I had asked him that does he have a mommy kink but he denied it everytime I asked him about it. He also wanted me to dominate him in pretty much every situation which I didn't like at all. (There was alot more weird things that happend in the relationship).\n    \n    Slowly I started to think that maybe we should break up because our relationship wasn't really working anymore. I asked if we could meet up and talk. I told him that maybe it would be best for both of us if we broke up. He clearly has his own problems that he should discuss with a professional and I said that I myself have my own problems that I needed help with. He seemed to understand but asked if we could still keep in touch. I said maybe and then he asked for a last hug. When he was hugging me he said \"maybe in the future we can try again\". In my head I just went \"nope\" and left to go home. \n    \n    Afetr the breakup he continued to send me messages every single day for 2 week when I told him to stop and that he should take time for himself and also to give me space. He didn't take that well and because of that I had to block him on everything. Some time passed and things were going well for me, until I saw him at my work place. At first I though he was there by accidet but later I learned that he was working there too. (EDIT: I had started working at that place after we broke up and he started working there after me). He knew that I was working there so why on earth would he come to the same place to work? For these few months I have had this weird feeling that I was being watched. I thought I was just paranoid but it was confirmed for me because one day I was going to the dressing room and when I came out I saw him at the end of the corridor behind a glass doors and as he saw me see him he quickly ran away. I didn't see him following me or hear him cause I had my headphones on. So now he knows where my dressing room is. \n    \n    I'm honestly scared because idk what he might do and idk what I can do in this situation cause he hasn't actually \"done\" anything. Why would he come to work there anyway? Does someone have an advise on what I can do?",

        "Text": "Super triggering story, I need to get it off my chest.\n\nWhen I was 4, my parents (very lately, I know) decided I should be circumcised. I went in, had it done under laughing gas. That night, my mom went to undress me, and when she pulled my underwear, the fresh stitch was caught on it, and it MANGLED my little dick. Super traumatizing, right? \n\nIt gets worse,\nHad to go BACK to the hospital that night to get it fixed, and they said I couldn’t be put under twice in the same day, so my mom and two nurses had to hold my body down while the fixed AND redid the surgery. \n\nTurns out, the reason it was hard the first time was because I had a birth defect, resulting in an abnormally large urethra (big pee-hole on tip). \n\nThis ordeal gave me a lot of medical anxiety, but also, now that that the problem was exposed, I was pissing in 40 directions at once, and so I had to be in and out of the children’s hospital until I was 8 for “reconstructive surgeries”, including one 3 week hospital visit where I was in a room with a cancer kid, being rolled around in a wheelchair with a man sized catheter hooked up to me. The nurses were always applying jelly and stuff to my penis, and that coupled with the install and reinstallations of the catheter, I was heavily traumatized and resented having a penis. \n\nWhen school started again, I think I was in 3rd grade, teachers noticed I was inattentive, demure, and somewhat hostile / defensive at times. I Was diagnosed as ADHD, and a friend of my mom recommended I see a therapist. \n\nThis is where things got really bad….\n\nThe therapist recommended, I’ll call him Dr. R, belonged to a small non-profit medical association that had its own private estate it ran therapy out of. The company consisted of 4 people, with him being the only one on site. \n\nThey specialized in “sick, dying, &/or disadvantaged children” \n\nIt was a luxurious property, tucked away in the forested mountains. There was a main office, chock full of giant amethyst stones, a grand piano, books and toys galore, that the sessions were meant to happen in. The first time I went, I was with my mom, and I loved him. His vibrato was soft, he sounded wise and kind. At the time, I was only 8, so I wouldn’t have been able to understand he was most likely a homosexual.\n\n At first, it was therapy, testing me for ADHD, asking about my home life, what I thought about school. He very quickly pivoted into convincing me I was hyper-intelligent (I was, my IQ is about 150, and I was a very bright young mind), and telling me how different I was, but how that was okay, and that the world wouldn’t understand me, but he did. This made me very attracted to him (non-sexually obviously I was a little kid), and soon, my mom just started dropping me off, not staying for the 2 hours the sessions lasted. \n\nWhen we talked about my penis, I was so desensitized to the verbiage, that I didn’t understand how the questions he asked were different from the nurses. \n\n“Does it hurt when I touch it here” was a line I’ve heard a million times, and he was a doctor, so I figured I should trust him. Didn’t even see a need to tell my parents my penis was being heavily discussed, let alone the touching. \n\nThis went on for a year or two. Eventually, we were so close, he’d take me deeper into the compound where his personal home was, along with several other small structures that were still under construction. I remember getting in his truck to drive the half mile in to his house, thinking something felt off, but I had to go with him.\n\nHis house was filled with beautiful paintings, decorations and statues. Most of which depicted the naked male form. Again, it was weird, but I didn’t n ow WHY it was weird. He fed me soup, and would do things like ask me to roll a slinky down the stairs to him (was probably looking up my shorts, I was afraid to wear underwear and he knew this).\n\nHe even convinced my parents that since I was one of his favorite clients, he wanted me to pose with some other kids for a billboard / company logo pic.\n\nThey agreed, and my pic was on that site until the GOVT took it down last year…\n \nEventually, he flew too close to the sun and asked my mom if he could have me for an entire Saturday for a “free session”. And when I returned she said I looked groggy, weird, and silent, she pulled me from the program entirely. She thought I’d been hypnotized.\n\nNobody say my mom should’ve caught it earlier, everyone thought he was weird, but he was a community staple, and the idea he was doing what he was,  was unthinkable. Also, they expected him to talk about my penis, so I’m sure my concerns could’ve been wrote off as a boy call wolf situation. But yeah she pulled me, didn’t tell the police or anything though. I really can’t remember being raped, but honestly, I don’t remember more than a few snippets of being up there total, the whole thing feels like a weird blur. It felt like that even just a month after leaving…\n\nI didn’t think about that time with him for a long time, until I met another boy in high school who said he had a weird experience with him too. We were both traumatized 13 yr olds who couldn’t understand what had occurred, but it turned into a fucked-up relationship where we would try sexual things on each other, thinking we were gay. It went on for a year (13-14, his dad was my piano teacher). I also thought I might be trans at this point, but knowing I had all this trauma with my penis, I couldn’t be sure I could trust those feelings either. \n\nFF to 8 years later (21 yo), I’m living across the world, engaged to a beautiful girl, working a 9-5 and paying bills, when Im sent a news article that Dr. R had been accused of grooming and serial raping a 14 yo boy on the same compound at his private residence. Once the boy came out, several men call me, saying they remember me “joking” about being raped by Dr. R in high school, saying they think they were groomed too. I didnt know what to say other than that I was so sorry that happened, and recommended they follow up with the police. \n\n Thing is, I called the police a few weeks later and said I had evidence of this happening, and that I can prove I was there. I described his personal house, the compound layout, things only a victim would know about him, they said my story lined up, but my pic on the website was the kicker. Thing is, this was pre-Diddy, and I was too slow to form a class action SA case. Their shitty lawyer helped them foreclose the property, and he’s been sentenced to 20 years (he’s already 78 or something) so there’s nothing I can get from this I don’t think, no money at least.\n\nNo amount of money can fix the levels of fucked up shit he put in my life though. \n\nI spiraled into drug addiction, cross dressing, self harm, risky sex and dangerous activities for most of high school, survived 2 overdoses, a suicide attempt, and a 3-month psych ward stay where they said I had “PTSD, OCD, BIPOLAR 1 with psychotic features, ADHd, and autism, but wouldn’t give a 17yo a formal diagnoses for anything. It’s like they were just throwing darts at a board. I’m not an insane person. TRULY, I mean that, I’m a complex person, but I never had hallucinations while sober…\n\nThey did however formally drug me with every atypical antipsychotic under the sun, causing extreme weight gain, brain fog, depression and anxiety that made everything worse. At 17 I was 5’10”, 130 pounds and was in AP classes across the board (even while in active addiction). By 18, I weighed 215lbs, smoked weed constantly to combat the muscle aches, and had lost 90% of my “friends” due to  my newfound asocial behavior. \n\nTook years of hard-drug sobriety, therapy (EMDR, CBT, DBT, parts therapy etc.), and good relationships with new people to realize I was capable of coming back down from my years long fugue state, where I had been dissociating 80% of my waking hours. That figure is probably still around 50%, but now that I know my brain didn’t “make up” the Dr. R stuff, I feel vindicated, and PISSED THE FUCK OFF.\n\nTruthfully, this started with me hoping this story could help me understand why I’m understandably confused about my sexuality and gender, but now I’m just sad this happened to me. I was such a happy-go-lucky kid before, nothing but potential, and while I actively try to be my best self everyday, it just doesn’t feel fair I had to endure this from so young. I don’t remember being a kid. I don’t remember having a good relationship with any older man in my life, I don’t remember doing things for my own sake, I don’t remember ever having any control over myself, and now that I do, I’m even more sad, because life’s too fucking depressing to “re-live” my childhood in a healthy way. \n\nI’m only 22 now, and I know that time heals all, I’d like to think I’ve fallen on a bit of archaic wisdom with the amount of suffering I endured, but fuck, I’m allowed to feel helpless one last time. I’m allowed to be scared that I never got the chance to understand myself before the weight of the uncensored world put its pedophealic penis on my shoulders. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin, with my own body, in my own house, and feel safe, and I just hope it comes sooner than later. \n\nI want to be a great husband, I want to be a loving father, I want to be an educator who is down to earth, caring and protective. I want to have sex and be able to cum in less than 50 minutes, I want to touch my body and not feel confused about how it should make me feel, I wish I could pee standing up without the other men in the bathroom hearing my piss sizzle like it came from a horse cock. I wish I could wear boxer briefs and see an in-person therapist….\n\nI wish this never happened…\n\nThis was super long and fucked up, if anyone reads to this point, thank you…",

        "Text": "This is a trigger warning and a trigger pleading. This post contains the topics of going to tell and topics of faith.  The trigger pleading is, please go all theological or atheological on me. I can only take so much. I already had PTSD from a long coma when I had a series of nightmares and psychotic episodes about being in hell and about being condemned to hell. I lived in horror. Now I'm hypervigilant about trying to be moral, which translates into trying to be perfect. I have to tell myself things like \"It's okay to have an opinion,\" and \"Not every thought can be positive.\" I literally flinch, stutter, and stammer when I have intrusive thoughts. I was traumatized by things that didn't happen and now I'm hypervigilant about being things I can't be. I feel like it's doing something weird to my self image. Like the way I see myself is changing, or maybe diverging. On the one hand it's morphing into this canine, evil caricature. On the other hand its like, at 49 years old, seeing myself as an adult of reasonable intelligence who still has time to build a life before I end up old, alone, and broke. What can you do about hypervigilance? I've got intrusive thoughts that, when I don't take tons of Prazosin, are saying all the most terrible things and tearing at me. And the more intrusive thoughts I get about how bad I am, the more hypervigilant I get. I just want to scream, \"I reject the premise!\" That crap didn't happen, they were delusions or hallucinations or whatever the hell you have when you're psychotic.  I don't have to try to be a saint because I was never the antichrist. That last is a little convoluted, but I think it gets the point acrost. Besides bribing my doctor to up my prazosin, does anybody have any advice on how to be less hypervigilant and how to deal with intrusive thoughts?",

I never thought much or swelled much on it but now that I have a company helping me apply for benefits, things are starting to piece together.\n\nMy ever so lovely wife has over the years told me I can be emotionless/uncaring and I can get pretty mean, which is suppose from an outsider perspective is true but I am never violent. I don't have many friends by choice, I avoid crowded areas and generally prefer to be at home which I have a security system watching all entrances that is motion activated to send me alerts. To me, this is just normal and sensible.\n\nAfter talking to a medical professional of the possibility of having PTSD, it made me realize maybe that is why I am the way I am. My first marriage did not work out and didn't end on great terms as we grew very distant emotionally and went out separate ways and have not communicated since. I also had a contract job I was let go of unexpectedly where they had me go into another building to tell me while they cleaned out my desk ask if they thought I was gonna have a violent outlast or something. I've never been a violent person. \n\nSo yea it's all making me think that I might have PTSD. If the VA approves my claim I plan on talking to a medical professional about it to better understand it and hopefully improve my behaviors with people.",

I have a PTSD diagnosed by multiple people (therapists) due to the fight with a violent disease as a kid. It's not important to tell which one, just it was not cancer. It's a chronic one I still have it but under control. The trauma came from the symptoms, the way the disease was treated and of course the constant bullying at school. I feel a bit embarrassed actually because when I read some stories it looks like I would have no reason to complain. I am often asked to shut up about that btw.     \n\nSo anyway, I am not in very good shape,of course I fell into opioids. We don't have the opioid crisis and fentanyl is not really a thing here, that doesn't mean opioid addiction isn't a thing or common, ofc. Hopefully methadone works well so far at a relatively low dose.       \n\nI spent the week with a girlfriend and of course was absolutely panicking and triggered all the time. She told me now she was scared for herself when I was melting down. I would like to emphasize I have never ever in my life physically hurt anyone. I would never have touched her. Of course I understand you can scare someone because it's impressive to see you crying and doing all you can not to explode your head on the wall. I understand it can be scary, I am not here to complain about her reaction which is, after all, rather normal. She lied the whole week she told me about having a good time because she believed she had to protect herself, I understand. I am absolutely heartbroken and in pieces like a broken mirror, but I am not blaming her she did what she thought was the best.\n\nMy only question is simple. Is there a way back from this nightmare? I thought I had prepared the best I could but it was a total fiasco. I don't know what to do. Because of my disease I can't even drink away my sadness. I have to face. I am in total and absolute despair and loneliness. Of course her reactions triggered a cascade of memories of when I thought \"well done\" before being said \"mmmmm sorry your emotional reaction\" blabla or \"you looked strange\" (actually tired I haven't touched any psychotrope in years except from the methadone, a lesser evil for me). I am currently living with my parents on top of that.\n\nAnyway, thanks for those who took the time to read me. Have a good day, everyone. English is not my native language, perdon any mistake.",

I know meds will kick in but after that I feel like I’ll just go through the same things again and still never be happy or ok. I’m safe now but I still feel like it’ll all repeat itself because there’s something critically wrong with me to the point where I attract all of these things to happen to me.

Growing up, I was never allowed to have my bedroom door shut unless I was changing clothes, and I couldn’t lock the bathroom door until my younger sibling was born. Anywho- due to a lot of past experiences I remember always preparing myself to stay locked in my room for an extended period of time if worse came to worse. I used to stash snacks and water in my room, made sure my tissues were replenished, and always had a lot of random hobbies, books, and other things around too. I asked my bf if he ever did this as a kid, and he thought I was weird. It was like a game to me, and I continued to do it everywhere I stayed as I grew up. I would think to myself, “hmm, how long could I survive in my room if I had to lock myself in here for an indefinite period of time? Which stuffed animals HAVE to be with me when things get bad? How long would these snacks and water bottles last me if I rationed them out?” I never thought about it until I talked to my bf, but now I realize that was not normal behavior. I do think that it was my child-self trying to keep me as safe and prepared as possible, although I’m  not sure why. Isn’t that weird? ",

We'd love to get your insights!\n\nYou don't have to answer all the questions, any response is appreciated!\n\n1. Would you be open to trying a new technology-based approach for managing fears or anxieties if it could save you money compared to traditional therapy? Why or why not? \n2. How much do you currently spend (or would you expect to spend) on exposure therapy per month? Would you consider switching to a technology-based alternative if it reduced those costs? \n3. If there were a technology that allowed you to experience exposure therapy from the comfort of your home, would you be willing to invest in a VR headset to access it? What factors would influence your decision?\n4. How important is flexibility (e.g., time, location) when it comes to choosing therapy options? Would you pay for a subscription-based service that lets you manage your treatment on your own schedule?\n5. Would you feel more comfortable paying a one-time fee for an app or subscribing monthly to access a wider range of features and ongoing updates? Why?\n6. How much would you be willing to spend monthly for a subscription service that provides effective, at-home exposure therapy experiences?\n7. If a subscription-based app offered features like progress tracking, customized experiences, and expert support, would you consider it a good alternative to in-person therapy? ",

I felt like if I left I was abandoning him and that was actually a projection of my own fear of abandonment. \n\nFinally in September, I called the police and got out of there for good. Went no contact, moved in with family, and got on meds and therapy (currently just telephone therapy every 2 weeks) which I feel like isn’t enough. \n\nMy whole point of posting is I realized I have 2 really awful days a week, Sunday and Thursday where I’m extremely anxious, and have frequent intense panic attacks. Then it donned on me that Sunday was the day he went to work and there was always some physical and mental abuse on that day because he didn’t want to go to work and would take his frustration out on me. Then Thursday was his day off and he would be so angry and grumpy from working we would usually fight pretty badly. \n\nIt’s just really hard to deal with because on the other days I’m fine and then it’s like my body knows it’s Sunday or Thursday and BOOM I’m back to feeling like complete shit. \n \nIs this normal with PTSD? To have specific days that trigger you even when you don’t acknowledge the days? I don’t know how else to explain it. I just want to move on and feel better but on those days my anxiety meds do nothing and I feel like I’m going to throw up the entire time. \n\nThanks for reading. ",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "If you’re triggered by substance abuse, please don’t read this any further. To make a long story short, almost a year ago, I became friends with my neighbor. She told me she was newly in recovery from addiction. To be honest, when I heard that, I did start to worry. I lost my father from alcoholism a few years back and have dealt with extensive addiction issues in my family. I’m diagnosed with CPTSD due to severe childhood abuse and neglect, a lot of that trauma came from the hands of my alcoholic father. This friend talks extensively about her addiction to me, and in April, I had to set boundaries that I can’t be a support system in the way she’d like me to be due to my own trauma. Since then, she has relapsed multiple times. She has gone to rehab, came home to her parents that are extremely religious and don’t at all understand addiction, then she immediately relapsed. She has been drinking and driving. The day before yesterday was her most recent relapse, and I have reason to believe she was drinking and driving again. I have extremely low tolerance for behavior like that, because that’s something my dad did with me in his car frequently. He could have killed me due to his selfishness, and it’s something I’ll never forget. I do not take putting other people’s lives at risk lightly, because of how many times I could have died. Not only that, but I was with my father as he was dying, and she knows that. Anything involving death and potential death I cannot handle.\n\n\nShe wants to see me, but I do not want to see someone in active addiction. I was a people pleaser for years, but lately, I’ve been learning more and more how to prioritize and protect myself. I don’t think I can remain in this friendship if this keeps reoccurring. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to approach this. She knows in detail what I went through with my dad, yet she still thinks that out of all people, speaking to me about her relapses, etc. is acceptable. She put a trigger warning on the text, but quite honestly, that isn’t enough. I cannot for my own mental health be of any support to her without destroying and triggering myself, having flashbacks, and I don’t think she gets that. I love her and care about her, but I’ve had some other issues arise within the friendship as well, such as constantly contacting me, then relapsing continently after I don’t respond, among other things. Which, to be honest, is triggering for me and does make me feel responsible for her. I’m Autistic and chronically ill, need my alone time, and cannot be with someone physically or be in contact with someone constantly. No matter how many times I try to explain that, it’s like she never gets it. I don’t think she at all means for me to feel responsible, but I do. I cannot help someone in active addiction without feeling like their life is in my hands due to what happened with my father and other family members. I quite honestly can’t even speak about addiction in general without graphic images of my father popping into my head. I can recognize that’s due to trauma and not her fault, but to protect myself and heal further, I cannot ever feel like I’m in a situation where I feel responsible for someone ever again. I can recognize that she deserves support, but this is support I cannot provide her. If you have any input or advice you can give me, please do, because I’m at a loss right now on how to handle this. I worry that anything I say won’t be received well, especially because of the state that she’s in. ",

On the other hand, I think it’s quite reasonable to be afraid of dogs and that most people should be more cautious than they are.\n\nHas anyone else had to decline social invitations and spend less time with friends due to dog attack PTSD?

I also missed work a couple weeks ago because of a meltdown that kept me up until 4am the night before.

I will talk to him about this, but I haven't gotten to it yet: I do definitely experience derealization/depersonalization, but I also experience periods of amnesia (I guess?).\n\nWhen I read about amnesia and PTSD I mostly see discussions of amnesia around the trauma, which I have. However, I also experience loss of time on a regular basis, and it feels different than my other dissociations (in fact, it feels like nothing at all, because I just realize time has passed and I don't know what happened during that time).\n\nI experience this on a daily basis for what must be short periods of time (maybe 10-30 minutes?), but I have experienced longer lapses in time. For example, in undergrad I remember heading to my 1:00 class at 12:45, walking straight there, and then when I arrived, everyone was gone and I realized it was about 4:30, but I had no memory of what had happened over the last few hours. It is like I'm time travelling.\n\nI also have memory loss that I think might be related, such as people knowing who I am and my friends telling me that I've met them multiple times, but I have no idea who they are. Also sometimes I will see men on facebook or in person who I feel like there is a 50/50 chance I hooked up with them but I just can't remember (though this makes more sense to me because my trauma seems to relate to men). And I have dated men for several months who I really liked, and then I completely forgot they existed until many months later and then it was too late since I appeared to have ghosted them.\n\nDo other people with PTSD experience anything like this?

During the start of high school I was still doing okay in class, although I knew it wasn’t going to be that way for long, I was a stupid teenager so I never did anything about it back then because as long as I passed, my grades didn’t really matter to me. In grade 10 I decided to be stupid and started vaping, weed and nicotine, and hung out with “that” kind of group. I also started cutting myself at around this time.\n\nDuring grade 11, My parents found out I was cutting myself, my dad lifted one of my sleeves during DINNER, IN PUBLIC because he suspected it(looking back it was quite obvious I was), once we got home he basically just told me to stop doing it(I don't remember the full conversation but that's basically how it went), he showed almost no sympathy. later on in the year I lost my job one day and my dad physically assaulted me, and we yelled and screamed at each other and it got very personal(specifics, I couldn't stand it anymore so I ran out of the house(there's more to the story, I’m just trying to keep this short), I called my mother, who called the cops. My mom told me to run to a location, where my grandfather was and I was (physically)fine from there. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING came from this. The police did ABSOLUTELY JACK SHIT even though there should have been evidence, because of the camera's inside of my fathers house. This was the only time that I can remember he physically abused me, but he’s always been emotionally abusive. After the incident, I decided I didn’t want to see my dad for a while. This only lasted a few months before I decided to give in to him pleading with me to come back. The results of this are quite obvious, more emotional abuse but never physical. Eventually I decided to live with my mom again full time, although I did still see my dad once every while. I ended up getting another job at a grocery store. It was around this time I started trying to come out to some of my social group. I also stopped hanging out with the group I was in currently because obviously they wouldn't accept me as most of the group was edgy boys, I never stopped vaping nicotine and weed. now I was more-so hanging out with \"computer nerds\" and the like. I had always been interested in technology, and was really into gaming, I decided I wanted to be a game designer.\n\nDuring grade 12 I continued to hangout with this group and things we're good overall, apart from my grades still. One day I heard there would be a party and that a lot of my friends would be going, I went, had a good time, and left. Then the next party came around and I left that party in an ambulance because I didn't know that 1. I had low blood pressure and 2. that weed lowers your blood pressure, and when your blood pressure drops too low, it'll cause a syncope. My parents both wanted me to get at least a college diploma and I wanted to as well. I just wanted to take a year off of school to focus on my mental health, but NOPE, my mom and sister ended up basically forcing me otherwise(their reason being if I take one year off it would turn into 2,3,4 years, etc) and I applied to an advanced program for computer programming at the same college my sister was/is attending. at this point I was getting mostly 50's and 60's. but the one class I was struggling with most was my coding class. I just didn't do any of the work because I talked to my friends the entire class, I would have probably gotten around 20% if it weren't for my amazing teacher, who I kind of lied to, saying I was just burnt out. He let me pass with a 50. I kind of regret telling him I was burnt out, I should have let myself fail, it would have been for the better I think.\n\nAfter my 18th birthday I had to stop seeing my therapist as they only help with children. I started estrogen and hormone blockers, but after a month haven't gotten any since I suck with remembering appointments(actually I suck at remembering in general now). I ended up getting into literally the only college I applied to, anyways, here I am now, 7 weeks of past due work and getting about 0% in all but 2 of my 6 classes. I've tried the free tutoring the college offers already but that hasn't worked because it's been too slow. going forward, my mother suggested I stop taking estrogen temporarily because I'm not ready for the emotions it brings, which is fair, and she said I should start taking Adderall again(I was on Adderall for a little while during elementary school and it helped me with focusing). I've contacted my student success advisor and have a meeting with them tomorrow, and I'm going to see about switching my program to something hopefully more achievable.\n\nThis is all really worrying to me because mainly it's my education, but also because my dad actually paid for it and he's quite obviously unpredictable with his decisions.\n\nAt this point I don't even care I was wronged and just want to see if I can finish my education, then get the professional help I need, so any advice is great, feel free to ask questions if you have any. I know I'm most likely just fucked in this scenario but I want to at least try. Sorry for the long rant, I just feel as if my issues are deep rooted and I need to give an entire life story about them for people to properly understand me, and if this isn't allowed here I am willing to take it down.\n\nalso I want to mention that I am **not** diagnosed professionally and currently am still figuring everything out.",

        "Upvotes": 3,
        "Text": "The tl;dr version:\n\nI had immense childhood trauma due to nearly dying from health issues several times that I always pushed away for nearly four decades. I have spent all these years constantly afraid of dying and losing my loved ones, and suppressing those thoughts when they popped up. I've lived with chronic anxiety. I did lots of therapy and medications, but nothing worked. I heard psilocybin does wonders for mental health. Recently, I went on my first trip ever, a facilitated 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip and it was horrific because I relived all of my traumas on repeat and felt utter despair that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I was left destroyed, just hopeless and despaired. Days later, all I have are the memories of my traumas in the forefront and hopelessness about life. I am scheduled for another 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip in a few days and am worried that it will be the same and am worrying if it's a good idea for me to do. I was wondering if anyone has experience with trying psilocybin with their PTSD and if there's any hope that the second trip will be different and healing.\n\nThe details:\n\nI nearly died multiple times in childhood and had multiple horrifying medical experiences. Afterwards, I was left very anxious and frightened all the time, but like the doctors told me to, I pushed the bad memories away and tried not think about them. For nearly the four decades since, I have been constantly anxious to the point it impacted my ability to get an education or have a job or do anything with my life. I've spent these years always afraid of dying and of losing my loved ones and constantly pushing those thoughts out of my head. I tried loads of therapy and loads of medications, but nothing ever worked even the slightest.\n\nRecently, I got into a program where I could (legally) try two 25mg doses of psilocybin (2.5 grams in shrooms) with a facilitator present and non-directive prep and integration sessions (basically them hearing me out, but not giving any instructions or feedback). I had heard that psilocybin does wonders for mental health issues and allows you to see things different and reduce anxiety. I did the first trip recently and it was awful. I was forced to relive all of traumas I'd been suppressing on a loop, having them happen again and again over those hours. The only thoughts in my head on repeat for the whole trip were that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I felt and still feel utter despair and immense pain. I cried the whole time. The facilitator tried to comfort me throughout and was attentive, but nothing helped. I left completely drained with memories of my traumas at the forefront and fear and hopelessness about how anything could happen to me or those I love at any moment. I've been stuck like this for days. I'm having trouble sleeping and cannot engage in activities I once found even slightly comforting because all I can think about is impending doom and all I feel is constant fear.\n\nI am scheduled for a second trip with the same dose (cannot be lower) in a few days and I don't know whether it's a good idea. The facilitator said it could be good because I've been suppressing/avoiding all my childhood traumas and now they're on the surface and another dose might allow me to discover more about myself that hasn't come out yet. I'm worried that what I'll experience again is hours of reliving my traumas, being bombarded with thoughts of death and feelings of complete despair. I'm wondering if it could destabilize me even further and I'm scared of being like the me just 20 years ago who was afraid to even go outside alone or turn off the lights to go to sleep.\n\nI'm looking for advice or insight from those who have experience with psilocybin for their PTSD and whether there is any hope that going on another trip could provide me with healing rather than just brutal exposure to my trauma and fear.

        "Upvotes": 3,
        "Text": "TLDR: Nothing in my life brings me joy except for my partner. It's gotten so bad that I stayed with him even after finding out he'd been cheating on me throughout our entire relationship.\n\nI’m a college student in my twenties. I know the word “trauma” gets thrown around a lot nowadays but throughout my whole life I have been severely traumatized multiple times. From multiple suicides over terminal illnesses in my close family to having to survive severe domestic abuse and sexual assault.\nYet I am still grateful for the good things in my life. I was born into financial stability. I have incredibly supportive friends. I am physically healthy and I have been able to experience a lot of beautiful things.\n\nAlthough I am grateful and I practice gratitude, I feel like I haven’t experienced actual joy since I was a little kid. I go on a lot of adventures with my friends. I travel. I go to concerts, movies, festivals, museums, good restaurants but I don’t feel joy. Sometimes I get a sense of fun from these activities but even then - once I get home, I am back to being trapped in my miserable mindset.\n\nI feel like no matter how hard I try, I won’t get better. For years I have been going to the gym and practiced different sports multiple times a week. I eat healthy. I drink very rarely and don’t do any other drugs. I get enough sleep. I stay on top of my self care routine. I keep my place clean. I do well in college. I have been in therapy and working on my mental health problems for over a decade. Tried different therapists, doctors, therapy approaches, medications. I talk to my friends. I support my community. I am open to new things. I practice positive thinking. I go out in nature regularly. I get my bloodwork done and my physical health is great. I also make sure I don’t obsess over leading a perfectly healthy life. I let myself rest when I need it.\n\nAnd still, I am unhappy. All the time basically. The only time I feel happy is when I am in love and I am loved by (or at least get attention from) a man. No matter how much love and attention I get from my friends and family it doesn’t bring me nearly as much joy as romantic love.\nWhen I am in a relationship, I turn into the happiest person alive. I could puke glitter and rainbows because I get so high off romantic love.\nThis addiction has led me to stay in incredible toxic, often life-threatening, dangerous situations.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started dating 8 months ago. I truly love this man. We have so many things in common and there’s not one dull moment when we’re together. Everything I do is for him. He’s told me multiple times that he has never had a woman care for him like I do and I believe him. It is borderline insane how hard I try to make him happy. This is my third serious relationship. Recently I have found out that he has been cheating on me online since the day he asked me to be his girlfriend. I am so incredibly hurt. I get physically sick to the point of throwing up thinking about it and my thoughts won’t stop racing. The only time I feel okay again is when I am with him. (As dumb as it sounds, I believe him when he says he loves me. I knew from very early on that due to his own childhood wounds he has an extreme need for validation. I just didn’t know that he would go looking for it in other women. I want to be optimistic, but I have a very hard time believing that he will change.)\n\nI just want to stop being dependent on men. I want to be able to experience happiness outside of a relationship. I want to be content enough with my life to a point where I don’t need to stay in terrible relationships because it’s the only way I can feel okay for once. I feel like I have tried so many things to build a nice life for myself but nothing works. Is there anyone else who has felt like this and was able to fix their problem?",

Worst of all is that I have a newborn nephew, but have since asked family to not send any more photos or videos of them because I can’t get that dead infant, or it’s poor siblings who were with their mother (squatters) out of my head. \n\nI’ve progressively gotten worse, have tremors while working in the heat, doing dangerous work, while driving, and have experienced what a trauma therapist confirmed is now two major psychotic breaks that genuinely have me terrified.\n\nThe desire for any sort of comfort from someone is equally met with absolute repulsion to talking, being touched, or letting anybody get a glimpse of how I truly feel. The mask is getting heavier to wear but the prospect of it falling won’t let me allow it to the degree I’ve had many instances of crying, laughing, and screaming all at once in my vehicle. \n\nWork down here is so overwhelming, but I can’t leave yet as it’s vital I put as much effort in as possible to make the amount I need to get through the winter.

Financially, we are barely making ends meet at this point and I can tell it frustrates and depresses my husband that he works so many hours a week and we can still barely afford groceries and rent at the same time. I've tried to find small jobs to do so that he could afford therapy even just 1-2x a month but I can't find anything long term that would allow me to stay home with our son, and we can't afford daycare either.

I was really excited when it blew up, and I was really really pumped to answer people’s comments and to be able to educate people on this topic through my lived experience. This was when things started to escalate, and the videos started reaching the wrong people. Someone started claiming that I was faking my disorder for clout, and began sending my videos to some of their friends. I immediately blocked said person as well as their friends who knowingly watched my videos.\n\nBut that didn’t end from there. As people got to see more of my videos from there, they started claiming that I was stuck in a victim mentality and that I wasn’t taking accountability for wallowing, and that I was ignoring advice from therapists.\n\nI’ve never seen fake concern trolls be so ignorant as this. I was really looking forward to sharing my own experience for awareness, but then those fakeclaimers decided to ruin it and fuck my digital footprint over.\n\nI have now fully privated my TikTok account where no trolls can reach me; only my trusted followers and mutuals can. They (along with my actual therapist/doctors) know me better than these awful concern trolls do.\n\nEdit: for those saying not to read the comments, I do wish it were that easy. It was practically impossible to not read the mean comments, because I had to read the filtered  comments in case someone had a question for me and it didn’t go through since TikTok’s filtering system can be really strict sometimes.",

I think it just makes me feel far too vulnerable and I don’t like how much it slows my reaction times. And it’s not like I have any traumatic event around it (that I know of anyways). It’s to the point where if I’m drunk or high and around another person I start freaking out, and it usually ends up being a panic attack. Which is weird, because usually doing it alone really helps with my anxiety. Is this something anyone else experiences? Feeling a bit isolated. ",

        "Text": "Any Lawyers Out There?\n\nFirst, what I will say is I’ve avoided posting this for 3 years, ever since it happened, because my shame was too big to even post this anonymously. \n\nI grew up being physically abused by my father. The ministry removed me from this household when I was 16 and eventually ended up living with my “white people family” - or so I called them. They walked me through a lot of pain and trauma, and spiritually helped me regain my faith in Christ. \n\nOne day, I set a boundary with my informally adoptive mom, and it ended up really triggering her, and she was in a daze. We agreed to take some time apart and she went out with her husband to the grocery store. \n\nWhen they came back, she was still in a daze and my informally adoptive father immediately went up to me and demanded that I speak with him in the garage. \n\nAt this point I’m really confused, but also triggered. Because being asked by a grown man to meet me somewhere like the garage feels unsafe. I try telling him that whatever is going on is between his wife and I, and that I didn’t feel safe going to the garage with him at that moment. I wanted to talk to the wife to see what was going on, but she went in the pantry and hid. \n\nAt this point, he grabbed me and started dragging me to the garage and with everything I tried resisting him and trying to flee. In doing so his shirt got ripped and he was bleeding from me trying to get his hands off me. He grabbed me by the neck and slammed me on the ground and started strangling me. I tried to scream for someone else in the house and he just said “___ is not home right now”. I tried to call 911 but he took my phone and threw it across the floor. I was losing consciousness. I thought that was it. \n\nSomehow I escaped at the last moment and ran to my adoptive mom. I was absolutely triggered and in shock and I asked her what the hell she was doing hiding in the pantry not doing anything. She asked me “what do you want me to do? Haven’t i loved you enough?” I was so enraged by her response with her awareness of my history of abuse and my own biological mother’s lack of action in the abuse, I went crazy and tried to “show her” what I wanted her to do which was to call the police or intervene, so I started strangling her, knowing my adoptive father would call the cops. \n\nI went balistic. I had never done anything like this before. But I just couldnt understand what I had done to warrant not being protected by my second mother. My adoptive father did the exact same thing my father did to me growing up, only a thousand times worse, and my adoptive mom just stood there asking me what I wanted her to do in response to her husband strangling the life out of me. \n\nI could hear my adoptive father on the phone telling the cops I was being abusive (which yes I was) and that I was “just some girl who lived with them who was mentally ill”…\n\nWhen the cops came, they blamed me for what I did but did not listen to me when I said that he strangled me first - they said “I’ve never seen anyone bleed like that before!” He was referring to my adoptive father’s ripped shirt and bloodied arms from me scratching at him to try and get him off of me. They treated me like dirt and I got kicked out of the house and my “father” didnt tell them what he did while I admitted to what I did. \n\nWhen I went to ER they said I almost died as he had popped quite a few blood vessels in my neck. I had countless scratches and bruises and sustained a tear in my wrist (TFCC tear) that prevented me from working for the next 3 years. \n\nI was denied victim services because they went based off of my adoptive father’s report, and even though i made a report telling the police everything that he did and admitting everything that i did. \n\nI lost countless friendships after this incident as I either could not trust them or I was too suicidal for them to be around. \n\nI now live with my abusive parents because I’m too unwell to work enough to be able to afford my own place. \n\nI lost everything. \n\nI dont know what to do. He works at a church, claiming to be a Christian, and I too dont know how to live with myself after what I’ve done. I feel so alone in this world and my faith is also shaken too.\n\nI forgot to mention. Before this incident took place, there was a time where he grabbed my wrists and left bruises but I was told by Christians that it was “my trauma” and that i should forgive him and trust him because its what “fathers do out of lovingly protection”. Not knowing any better I trusted this, thinking God was wanting me to forgive, hence it now being hard to trust in God anymore too/trust what I think I hear from Him. \n\nI’ve called countless Legal Aid resources only to be told no one can help me because of the complexity of my situation. \n\nAfter all of this... My question is - is there any hope for me? Are there any lawyers out there or anyone who knows what I can do? I just want the truth to be told. I’m ok if I go to jail for it. But he still to this day will not admit what he has done and I have lost so much because of it. I also want to heal from my own actions because I know what I did was not okay. But I just want the truth to be told. Is there anything, anyone out there knows what I can do?",

It was physical and emotional abuse as well as S/A. I have been struggling constantly to cope with the feelings of loss and rage and sadness and the empty feeling of not being able to access the same love and emotions I could with my abuser. Sometimes it feels like we were married, we never were but I felt like I had a connection with them on a level deeper than I have the capacity for anymore- which is strange because towards the end I didn't even want to be in a relationship with them. I don't feel how I did toward the end of the relationship when I have emotional triggers- I feel like I'm staring at the version that messed me up the most (1 to 2 years in to the relationship)\n\nI am in a loving relationship now and have been for two years but I have realized that not all the memories I have are bad but they all hurt the same. I thought flashbacks were only negative moments? I can mostly forget about the memories in my day to day but when I'm reminded it floods back all the good and bad and makes me enraged and upset to the point of crying and wanting to scream. I don't necessarily get visual flashbacks like I'd expect to but I have a rush of emotion where I feel like the feelings in my body need to come bursting out it feels like I'm standing in the room with them again. It feels like I'm looking right at them.\n\nPeople keep telling me to write letters and burn them but I'm so angry and upset I just want closure and I can't figure out how to heal - the only closure I can see is being able to get it out directly to the person as nothing else seems to work and no one understands this.\n\nI went without triggers and nightmares for a long time but suddenly it's flared up again for seemingly no reason. With no specific trigger.\n\nI guess I just want to know.. have you experienced this? Why is it suddenly back? How can I reconnect with others? How can I trust again and feel love? I feel so tired, I'm exhausted and it feels like I lost a piece of me with my ex and that I can't recover it. I can't stand intimacy as it makes me feel gross and I struggle to express my love for others. It's gotten so bad I literally start bawling once a week because I feel my current partner deserves better but I am on the road to finding medications that work for me and I'm starting EDMR after years of CBT not working. I just don't know who I am without him and I've been running for a long long time. \n\nThank you for listening.\n\nAnd for those who feel the same I wish nothing but healing and unconditional support for us on our journeys.",

I'm asking for some personal experiences (hoping for some positive ones and not only negative, though honesty is always appreciated.)\n\nI was diagnosed with moderate to severe Complex PTSD in 2019. Since then, I've been on and off going to talk therapy, and trying natural management at home the best I can.\n\nI have had a lot of fear of starting medicine over the years related to side effects, dependency, withdrawal, and not wanting to gain a ton of weight (I don't care about a few lbs. But I am quite  active and want to be able to stay that way). I also have two addicts for parents, and two siblings who have also struggled with addiction, so I have been very hesitant to start anything that could have high addiction/withdrawal potential. \n\nI have made some vast improvements mentally as far as perspective goes towards myself, my trauma and my life, but my physician, psychiatrist and counselor agree that though my mind is making progress, my body seems to have endured disregulation for so long that it's unable to get out of that cycle on its own. My counselor has encouraged me to explore options for medication (especially anxiety related medicine). \n\nAfter 5 long years of fighting it I started on sleep medicine. It took several tries and I'm currently taking Lunesta, which seems to work during certain times and not others. (I tried hydroxyzine, doxepin, Quviviq, Trazadone, and this. All the other meds didn't work or gave me horrible side effects that were unsafe or unbearable). I also have some experience with psylocibin mushrooms, which were profoundly helpful in my healing, but aren't always easy to access or physically easy to use in my area. \n\nI'm also starting ketamine injection appointments and would love to hear about the process and results that ketamine has brought for some of you. \n\nMy biggest symptoms seems to be insomnia. I've struggled with it for well over a decade, and it has increasingly gotten worse. All over the counter sleep aids and herbs have all eventually stopped working. My doctor and counselor think that the insomnia is caused by anxiety related to disregulation from sleep and my room not being a safe place for me for a long time. I used to have frequent nightmares, but now I'm not sleeping well enough to dream most nights. \n\nMany of my other symptoms have improved with years of work, but my quality of life suffers immensely from the lack of rest and the feelings of anxiousness at times. I wake up everyday never feeling rested, always exhausted everyday. I've tried quitting stimulants, trying natural mood and cognitive enhancing nootropics etc, and I'm really struggling with this. \n\nMy question is for those of you who may have similar issues with sleep and anxiety - what have you tried, as far as SSRIs, SNRIs, anxiety medicine, etc, and what helped you? Have they greatly improved your quality of life or quality of sleep in some way? Was it/is it worth it? Did you discontinue them at some point and how bad was it? \n\nAny and all information is appreciated. \n\n",

I feel like I'm standing on the top of a building, and about to fall over. Feels like death.\n\nI know now where it stems from. My father was always critisizing me, and giving me chores, and then scream at me when they wasn't done right. Or throw stuff at me. He also put me in situations where I wasn't comfortable, like signing me up for sports I didn't wanna do. And one time he put me on a theatre stage to audition, and I had absolutely no desire to. \n\nSometimes he got so angry at me, that he chased me out of the house, or even at one time, he threw me out of my home - he packed some suitcases and told me I had to move out in rage. Not sure what I had done. I must have been 13 or 14 at that time. His screming and hardness frightened me. He also wrote me a letter where he told me I was not good for the family, and I wouldn't amount to anything. \n\nI am still - to this day afraid I'll be homeless. I'm still having the feeling of doom over my head every day. I get extremely fearful when I have to be judged, and I feel very unloved - and I'm afraid of conflict. \n\nThis has colored my whole life. I'm not afraid of people in a general setting, and I can be very social. But I'm constantly afraid to get hurt, og judge people around me. And I have been hurt a lot of times. \n\nAs a kid I was bullied a lot, and I'm sure this goes into the equation also. \n\nI'm now 53. I keep getting stuck, but I also had a big and good life with many friends, and took many chances.  I'm very good at my job - I'm a music producer, and had many successes despite feeling this terror. I found a way.   \n  \nBut I keep doubting myself. I keep going back to \"black\" and feeling helpless. I guess that's why I never got a family. I have learned about myself that I was afraid to collapse – if I couldn't take care of myself – how would I take care of others? \n\n---- Back Story ----\n\nI've read and studied trauma for 10 years. I've been broken down from anxiety. Helpless. I have had trouble sleeping and functioning for many years. But yet, I feel like I'm managing my anxiety better every day. BUT - I still have that feeling of terror when I have to go to a meeting or meet people of influence. \n\nI've been to therapy. 3 times in my life (not 3 sessions - but 3 x let's say 20 sessions. I've talked to friends about this. I understand from a theoretic standpoint what's going on, but the feeling persist. I've done meditation for 7 years, I exercise and I eat right. I have learned self compassion. \n\nWhen I tried so much. Can anyone please suggest what the next step could be? I'm writing here, because I'm really feeling I need a new perspective. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

        "Text": "Yesterday, I was fully recreated into a “bad object” again, taking the mantel with my mother and grandfather and grandmother and sister.\n\nAfter blocking him when he said he was cutting me off after not responding for 26 hours, my father emailed me from unknown emails and texted from unknown numbers, using subject headings like “I’m so sorry” before piling on abuse.\n\nThe wild part is that this time I actually never said anything. I got angry when he said he was cutting me off again after I failed to respond for 26 hours (while in Vermont with no power, to a MacRumor) and said the angry things I had to say to my step mother, who recently promised over and over again that I can talk about anything related to my father to her because she understands the hurt and anger and can separate what I have to say from the relationship she has. Well, she took those things straight to my father. At least some of them.\n\nWith my only recent input having being for him to not discuss family stuff with me while I work through CPTSD from childhood trauma like 3 weeks ago (SINCE I have FaceTimed and regularly texted to check in) as well as whatever my step mother decided she needed to tell him I said, he sent me a 12 point bullet list of why I’m a terrible person from every angle and outlining the damage I’ve caused without actually mentioning how or to who (him? I mean come the fuck on I was a child!).\n\nIt shook me so badly I reached out to my mom and siblings to ask about said “damage” and they basically laughed me out of the room. It took like five attempts for them to realize I was seriously asking if I’d caused comparable damage to my father. But like always, he was just saying what hurts the most. What would stick with me.\n\nSo now I finally understand he most likely has BPD that is not being treated. I didn’t understand that my sister was a “bad object” these last 5 years, I heard a very different side of the story. But we finally connected and talked about it, and I heard some of the things he said to her - things he would not dream of telling me he told her. Outright lies, and mean ones. I was living in an illusion for years, when you’re in his good sights it feels really good. You feel special and important and accepted.\n\nBut that is conditional. It can pivot on a dime, and it just did. I just got really good at staying in his good graces for awhile there.\n\nSo yesterday I made the decision to permanently go no contact. He’s taking “until November 1st to protect himself” - so far he’s sent me abuse from unknown numbers every day he spends “protecting himself” but I guess I’m just so dangerous he has to pre-protect himself by attacking me over and over.\n\nI’m trying to work through my childhood PTSD while new small traumas are created with this man. It is hard. I talked to my fiance and she’s going to help me not go back into the fold, is sad about the whole situation but agrees with the decision and is cutting them off as well.\n\nHow do you cope on a day to day basis? What tools do you use to do you daily activities when this stuff is at the forefront of your mind?\n\n**TLDR: My most likely BPD father was intensely abusive growing up, like a true crime childhood level of psychologically abusive. I thought he’d worked through it but after a decade or so I’ve found myself as the “bad object” again, which I’d been for the majority of my childhood. He’s been hurling abuse for days from unknown numbers and emails as I try to heal. It is hard. Need advice.**",

I just don't want this linked to my main as there's identifying info on there.\n\nMy wife has always struggled with mental health issues but she'd been stable on meds and doing better for a while (around 3 years). Her and her psychiatrist decided to try to go down on her psych meds because she was doing better and she went downhill really fast.\n\nShe's been refusing to sleep because of nightmares, keeps having flashbacks and keeps talking about wanting to kill herself. We went to the ER after she told me she didn't feel safe and couldn't promise me that she wouldn't do anything while I was asleep. \n\nI was really hoping that the hospital would be able to help her but so far they just haven't done anything. She's been using the landline to call me and says she has been feeling awful and keeps having flashbacks and crying. She finally got to talk to a psychiatrist today who didn't even adjust her meds. After that she talked to a social worker, who wants to give her something to help her sleep (and thinks she's manic cause she's not sleeping). The social worker said that she should be able to go home in a day or two as long as she's sleeping through the night.\n\nMy wife says she doesn't think they're taking her suicidal thoughts seriously and she wants to come home. I'm scared because I don't think I can keep her safe at home but if the hospital won't help her, who will? I don't understand how they can discharge her if she's just as suicidal as when she came in. She says she still doesn't feel safe. I don't know how to help.\n\nShe has no one to talk to about how she's feeling and there isn't even group therapy (apparently the group manager is on vacation???). So she's just been sitting in her room and crying. Aren't they supposed to have people she can talk to?\n\nI am just so worried about her and I don't know what to do.\n\n",

Though in the past year or two I’ve recovered some memories and realized I had a traumatic childhood, even beyond the fact that my parents were neglectful. I probably developed it around 1-2 years old as that was likely the height of my abuse, via family members no one should have trusted me around (thanks guys).\n\nBeen in CBT/EMDR and went through the DES-2 questionnaire. Scored a 31, which she said qualifies me as ptsd level dissociation. It’s weird to think I’ve been dissociated for so long since it feels so so normal, but it makes sense since I have felt emotionally numb since I could ever remember. Wasn’t fully aware of that fact till after I started dating/trying to manage relationships. \n\nI guess I’m in therapy so that’s a step, but what now? I feel like I can’t work, even though I’m managing to take care of myself, but it’s been so difficult trying to get back into a flow of working and getting money for myself. It feels like even if I have a good stretch it’s inevitably going to end up with my anxiety/depression spiking and me feeling like quitting my jobs again. I’ve been applying and of course hearing nothing back. Should I consider disability? I’ve worked before. Most of my possible years, actually. From 14-22 I was working pretty solidly with a filled resume and busy weeks, even though I hated every minute of it, felt like I was suffering for no reason, and constantly was quitting/switching positions or talking with my managers about how difficult it feels like I’m handling things. \n\nI don’t know, this is more of a vent. I guess I thought a diagnosis would take me somewhere. I feel so guilty for not being able, but not working this past year has felt like such a weight lifted off my shoulder. ",

One of them basically told me she doesn't believe I have PTSD, that I am just blowing things up out of proportion in my head so I can revel in playing the victim. I accused them all of being enablers of the guy who retraumatized me and made my acute symptoms come back, after they had been mostly in remission for most of 20 years. I think I have known for a while that it wasn't working out trying to cling on to these friendships, but I haven't had the heart to just ghost them or walk away. I wound up kind of trauma-dumping on them in another email, as if that was going to convince them when they didn't believe me before. \n\nI was stuck in fight-or-flight mode, the worst it's been in a very long time, and wasn't thinking rationally, of course. I couldn't get out of that mode for like a week straight, and I got into a bunch of trouble at work - I was in such a fog that I spent a whole day entering data wrong, and had to go back the next day and redo most of it. I was in a meeting and completely blanked on the fact that I had a due-out from it, until the head of our whole organization emailed to ask why I hadn't done it.\n\nThe girl who accused me of making up the PTSD suggested we should talk, so we set up a time, and then she got sick and had to cancel (not just an excuse, because I knew our talk was not the only thing she canceled on), and never reached out to reschedule anything. I could have just left it, but instead I took the initiative and asked if she wanted to reschedule, and now we have plans to meet in a week. I also have plans to meet with someone else who was on the blowup email. \n\nI don't know, am I being an idiot to keep trying with these people? I don't want to get my hopes up that things can ever really be okay between us again after what was said, on both sides; and yet I keep getting my hopes up that something can be salvaged. Am I just grasping at straws? It just feels too cruel and cold to simply give up on them and cut them off or walk away, after all the history and nice times we've had together, and all the times they were kind to me and supportive in the past. And they are care enough to talk, at least, and isn't that not nothing? Even if what we have to say to each other is, Goodbye, at least we tried?\n\nI don't know what I really want to hear ... partly just venting a bit, I guess, but I wouldn't mind thoughts and advice if anyone has been through something like this before. Is there hope things can get better? What should I focus on in trying to talk with them?",

It was really horrible to listen to the recording every day of the week after that, and I was a mess, really distressed and incredibly tired/worn out, in a way I didn't expect at all (even though everyone has told me it would be though) The second session when telling the story of the trauma, I felt so numb. I felt a lot of \"I don't want to do this\"/anxiety, but no emotions. Then, during the second week when listening to the recording, I felt again completely worn out/sick from the stress. I started getting horrible, MUCH worse than usual, pain in my body from the stress. I also got very distracted when listening, thinking about other things and feeling very distressed about them but not about what I was listening to. Then the third session, again, I didn't feel anything except this \"I don't want to do this\"-feeling plus intense muscle pain in my body. I felt like I was failing completely. Now, when listening to the recording, I didn't feel anything again. I'm really trying to get in touch with my emotions, but I don't feel anything, just a huge worsening in body pain, which I get distracted by, plus some other distracted thoughts. I even went back to the first recording, where I show a lot of emotions, to try to bring anything out. But I don't feel anything! Just the body pain, horrible muscle pain! I'm really worried I won't get any effect from the treatment.

        "Text": "I think I wrote like 5 full on essays about how I am feeling right now and I deleted all of them, but I thought maybe I should write something bittersweet instead.\n\nI am an adult but a few years ago after being kicked out for a while and living with a relative I bought two stuffed animals, they were dragons. It ended up completely changing my life. They brought me so much comfort that I decided to buy more, and more, and more, now I have a collection worth 8-10k (no I did not spend this much don’t worry haha, I just buy a lot of vintage/second hand and get good deals). I guess it’s gotten a little out of hand since the l’ve all essentially taken over my room but it makes me feel so happy and not alone.\n\nI had a lot of stuffed animals as a kid that I loved, but my parents threw a lot away or sold them. It was heartbreaking because they did not do this to my sister’s just me, probably a punishment for whatever it was at the time, but I lost everything, even the ones that were extremely sentimental. They even managed to get rid of one of my baby blankets to hurt me.\n\nSo this was my way of taking that all back, I just grew this passion for buying stuffed animals, specifically dogs, and maybe it seemed weird to people but it makes me happy and despite living with my parents still (for now) it makes my room a safe space. My bf said my room is super comforting somehow, I guess that’s kinda what I was going for.\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD last month when I finally took the step to get therapy and work on a lot of things. I kinda already knew deep down, but hearing that it is an official diagnosis hit me pretty hard. I have just not been in a good space but maybe tomorrow I will organize my stuffed animals since being really depressed they are not organized and it really bothers me.\n\nAnyways that’s all, sorry if this was odd I just can’t sleep and thought writing would help.",

I remember her kissing me and me not really liking it but her just kinda going on until she was done. But the thing is idk if this really happened. I remember it very vaguely but what I do remember feels very real to this day. Sometimes i think it was dream but the most important thing that I can remember was the actual feeling of us kissing and how much I hated it.\nYou don't really remember the actual physical feeling of things in your dreams the way I remember this. I remember years ago me and my older sister were having a conversation and she asked me if I had ever had my first kiss and I was like \"yeah you\" not really thinking much about it at the time as this was years after the incident but I was still really young. She just laughed about it and said it didn't happen and for years I never thought about it until recently. Now it just constantly pops up in my head and I wonder weather or not it really happened. Ik sometimes abuse as a child can be so traumatic that you forget as a lot of my childhood besides certain moments are almost completely forgotten, but I don't think this was bad enough for my brain to forget it? I don't necessarily think that this traumatized me but I do wonder if this did happen could it be apart of the reason as to why my mind is such a mess in my adult life? (I'm 20 now ) I also wonder if it is true then why did she do it? I would ask her but me and her have a pretty solid relationship nowadays so I would hate to bring up old drama plus if it didn't happen then that would be really awkward. But it's suddenly bothering the hell outta me because I feel like I'll never know.",

Idk what it’s like to not suffer, so I find ways subconsciously to bring the past to the present and I am struggling so badly to move forward. I journal, I try to do healthy things like sleep and meditate. It’s hard to stay consistent but I DO for the most part. It helps but my progress is slow and steady.

        "Text": "(Male) Hello, not sure if this is the right forum (I rarely use Reddit, so please inform me if it is not and I will promptly delete it/also posted to others in case this isn’t the right place to put it) but my therapist dumped me. Also warning for child sexual abuse as well and animal abuse (nothing graphic, essentially a very broad rundown, I don’t know how to edit flairs or add multiple if that is possible so apologies for that).\n\nI struggle with “intrusive thoughts” and understanding the concept of what is and isn’t morally correct in societies viewpoint. When I was a small kid figuring this out myself with a long history of childhood abuse (sexual and verbal), I took it out on animals in a violent way (which I will not get into detail what I did because I do not think it is necessary nor appropriate - but to sum it up I was a very empathetic child to a certain degree before something clicked after an event and I just didn’t feel that way towards animals besides irritation and puzzlement), along with other rather disturbing things beyond my home life that happened to me or around me. Now as a young adult, I understand to a degree why it is considered wrong and I lay down rules for myself for the things I don’t necessarily understand to prevent acting on thoughts and urges to adhere to societal expectations and avoid any ramifications (besides a few incidents as a teenager) and would never harm an animal or person if I can help it.\n\nHowever, I opened up and was honest with my therapist about my childhood (the first time I have been completely in-depth and honest about my childhood assaults and history with animals which is a breakthrough for me personally considering I’ve had well over six therapists growing up and never went in depth about those things in my childhood) and she essentially said she didn’t want to work with me anymore, and heavily considered I check myself into an institution before I “snap” - which absolutely boggled my mind. From personal experience, wards never helped me and in fact made things worse. \n\nI do want therapy, but I feel like I cannot be completely transparent and honest with an individual without a recommendation like that. Therapy in the first place never really helped me with the advice they offered, but it was therapeutic enough in itself to just talk without being “openly judged.” I don’t think I’ll be seeing any therapists anymore because honestly - I’ve given up looking for one who can deal with cptsd and people with a history like mine. Not to mention the waitlist times for therapy is absolutely insane where I am and if you don’t click with one, then you have to wait even longer. Honestly, I feel abandoned by her and quite pissed at the situation considering I was trying to get help for the things inside my head only to be cast out like some stray mutt.\n\nI just needed someplace to put this out into the open because I’m at a time where my mental health is getting horribly bad again and this really sent me over the edge because I was on my way there before I got the message she cancelled and didn’t want me as a client anymore, etc, etc. I do not know if I should continue looking for a therapist, or if it’s a complete lost cause? I don’t mind replies, advice or whatever if anybody has any - and if you took the time to read this all I appreciate it. Hope y’all have a good day/night. ",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "My mother and father had me at the ages of 23 and 25 respectively. They’d not been together long, and had split up before my mother found out she was pregnant with me. They got back together due to said pregnancy but split up again a couple months into my birth. I’d be between homes from then, spending half the week with my mother in her house and the other half with my father, who still lived with my grandparents. After a couple years my mother met my stepfather and moved in with him. When I started school, aged around 3, I’d only see my father at the weekend. He’d pick me up on Friday evening, and I’d go back to my mother on Sunday night. \n\nEvery time he came over to pick me up or drop me home, I used to be filled with dread, as my mother and father would have a full blown argument every single week without fail. It was quite upsetting for me at the time and each would make a point to blame the other in front of me. I eventually got used to it, but looking back, I think this may have had a massive impact on my life.\n\nWhen I was 5 years old, my father bought his first house, and the two of us would go there every weekend and spend the whole weekend together. One weekend he picked me up on Friday and I went back to my mother and stepfather on the Sunday. \n\nMy mother woke me up Monday morning in tears and told me I wouldn’t be going to school that day because my father had died Sunday night. I’ll never forget the sudden rush of numbness that overtook my body at that moment. I just couldn’t comprehend it. I’d only seen him no more than sixteen hours before, and now I was being told I’d never see him again. \n\nI didn’t cry at all. The feeling of sadness hadn’t really hit me whatsoever, it was more just the shock. I just couldn’t understand how he could just die like that. Being only 5 years old, my view of mortality was that only old people with grey hair and walking sticks die, not people who hadn’t even hit 30 years of age. My mother and I attended the funeral, I didn’t cry there either. Even though my mother and all my family on my father’s side were in floods of tears, I remained absolutely silent and completely numb. \n\nAs I got older, I’d think about my father every day and would visit my grandparents every weekend instead of him, as I’d basically been doing anyway, he’d only had his new house for a few weeks before his death. I never cried about his death, and always avoided talking about it. In fact, it’s very very rare that I’ll talk about it with anyone. At that age I didn’t want anyone to know and had no desire at all to discuss it with anyone. I’ve maybe told a handful of friends since and those have been very recent. \n\nA few years ago, I was talking with my grandmother, and the topic of my father arose. She got emotional talking about it, and asked me if I knew how he passed away. At this point, it dawned on me that I never tried to draw any conclusions for why a 29 year old man in decent health would suddenly die. But it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, and I knew what she was about to say before she said it. He committed suicide that Sunday night. \n\nI felt such a horrible sense of anxiety when those words left her mouth and didn’t know how to respond. After she left, I was still processing the information but I didn’t know what to do with myself. I started to panic and felt physically ill. I went for a walk to try and calm myself down but I just found myself getting more and more worked up as I paced down the road. The feeling is so difficult to describe. \n\nSince that day, my father’s death has really had a devastating impact on me. I think about it constantly every day, and have done for the last 3-4 years, and despite having moments alone where I shed some tears over the thought, I’m still very closed off about it and try to avoid the topic the best I can. I feel like before finding out I’d managed to sort of get over his death, but since finding out that he took his own life, it’s brought everything back, only 100 times worse…",

I'm on medication for depression and anxiety, but I can't afford to go to therapy at the moment, so I'm looking for some help in the meanwhile. How do I be a normal person with interests and feelings?",

I should be able to function normally now but I can't!!!!\n\nThe impossibility to talk about suicide, or land in a mental health institution again (idk why though), basically the lack of any means to get help, associated with the guilt, makes me feel like I am trapped in a situation where no one can help me.\nAnd that every single thing that doesn't go as planned is absolutely infuriating because it's taking the few energy that I have for something completely futile, yet if I don't do it then it's all over.\n\nI have so much anger because for the first time in my life I don't want to die, but everything is telling me that I should.\nI fear that depression is coming back, and that my every effort to combat the last one is completely irrelevant towards this one that is built upon my attempt.\n",

I have to concentrate on work and studies, but all I can think about is the empty gutteral feeling of not having a loving motherly figure. I have the support of my husband, but I know it breaks him apart as well. My mother fullfilled my deepest fear of someone close to me actually blaming me for the crimes commited against me, and i've never felt more scared to go home, but i have nowhere else to go. It's only been a couple of months that I came to terms with the fact that I was infact a child (15) when I was raped, my mother keeps on insisting, that I was a full grown adult. I never tried to blame her for what happened, it's not like she could keep a hormonal teenager indoors, but to claim that she had no responsibility in letting her 15 years old child be physically and sexually abused by another teenager seems simply absurd. Few of the break downs I've had in her presence have ended with her forcing me to take benzos, pulling a concerned face and whining about how hard it is to have an insane child, calling me a masochist for having flashbacks and other ptsd symptoms.

        "Text": "I want to share a very complex case with you—it’s a mental prison from which I am determined to escape. I’m working on a strategy for this and need help and support. I will share all the important facts that contributed to building this mental prison and describe the vicious cycle as it operates in my case.\n\nI was severely abused from my early years. My mother would beat me for everything, blame me, and stripped me of all my rights. She imposed all responsibilities, duties, and obligations on me. Additionally, she would tell me that my actions were insignificant and that I could not achieve real things. Yet, she blamed me for not studying, constantly conveying that I was completely dependent on my parents, so I should study. However, I didn’t have the tools to study. She terrorized me, saying that if I did not study and wasted my time, I would end up in an embarrassing job. An important factor to consider is the daily force-feeding when I was little, every day for many years; she would beat me if I could not eat an adult portion of a meal. Because of this, my body rejected food, and I was eating only to survive. I became unhealthy and thin, and with all these problems, I also had no energy to study and concentrate. However, I tried to study but couldn’t; my head was hurting, and I didn’t have energy.\n\nAs a result, I fell into depression. I was depressed for many years at school. I did what I could; fortunately, with the remaining energy, my brain was able to learn pretty fast, at least at a sufficient level to pass exams, but that was the minimum. However, this situation instilled in me a strong fear of not being able to do anything real or important, so a bad future always seems imminent. I am terrorized and have a strong fear of the future all the time. I always feel I need to have complete control over things to feel safe or okay, but I am never relaxed; I am always anxious. Even now that I work, I feel this danger about the work, that it will not continue forever. I have strong fears that something will go wrong.\n\nAlso, whenever I imagine a good thing in the future, that I achieve something important, my brain blocks it violently. I don’t know what it is, but immediately when I start to imagine that I am getting out of this situation and building a good future, I have a kind of short-circuit feeling that violently blocks these positive thoughts and distracts me from those positive images I am building.\n\nIn a schematic way, this vicious cycle works as follows:\n\n-\tI have a goal (for example, to study or to get my job done).\n-\tI feel like I can’t do anything important, so I can’t study well or I can’t do a job well, no matter my efforts.\n-\tI lose motivation to do things because I feel I will not be able to do them anyway, and I feel depressed.\n-\tI feel dependent on someone else for resources (like I was dependent on my parents as a child, now maybe at work), and I am terrified that if I cannot do my job properly, I will be abandoned.\n-\tBut I can’t do my job properly because I believe I can’t do important things no matter my efforts,\n-\tSo, I feel afraid that I will lose a job or a source of resources.\n-\tWhenever I imagine a concrete plan that can work well and start to imagine a good future for me, my mind violently blocks my thoughts, which completely deconcentrates me from these positive thoughts, and I can’t get back to them for some reason.\n\nI was able to solve the eating problem by concentrating on it as a priority, because without energy I could not do anything. But the rest of the problems remain to be solved. I have a clear picture of the major things happening in my mind but need to find a strategy to get out of it.\n\nI tried to discuss this with different psychoanalysts; I’ve changed more than 10 of them, but they could not make any progress, so I stopped searching and now I am trying to resolve it on my own. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to break out of this loop? What approach can I use?",

From around the age of 7 or 8, I started to understand that this abusive and unfair treatment was not normal, but I felt I had no rights, only duties and obligations, with absolutely no freedoms. Whenever I tried to speak up, run away, or take action, she would beat me again and again. I felt trapped and suffocated, which led to psychosomatic pains in my stomach due to fear and anxiety.\n\nMy father was always absent, working many hours, even on weekends, because my mother refused to get a job. So, unfortunately, she was always at home, and her extreme toxicity deeply damaged my mental health.\n\nI have complex trauma in many different aspects. In this post, I want to talk about one of them:\n\nFor some reason, she created an image of my father as being almighty, almost god-like. I remember this from a very young age. She would always compare me to him, telling me he was bigger, much better looking at my age, and that he was perfect in school. These comparisons were daily, and I heavily internalized all these things. She would tell me I was little, and that my thoughts and actions were insignificant. So, I practically had this image of my father, but I didn't know him from my own experience, because we never played together even once; he was always busy and away for work.\n\nGrowing up, this led me to the wrong conclusion that all adults have all the rights, and I have none. Subconsciously, I always felt women were untouchable, and men were so strong that I could never match them; I would always remain small and insignificant. I know consciously it's not like this, but for some reason, it continues to badly influence my emotions. So, all older people than me have power, and I don’t, even though I am already an adult. So I feel inferior in every aspect with respect to older people in general.\n\nThis is crazy, but when I go out for a walk or just to go to a bar, I am always alert and feel danger, especially from men. I think I need to protect myself. I also feel I can’t trust women, so I practically have uncontrollable fear of both sexes. I often have psychosomatic pains in my stomach for the anxiety and fear. This is real hell in everyday life and in every aspect. I live in isolation, have very few friends for this reason, and feel depressed because of it. I'm struggling to find the motivation to move forward daily.\n\nDo you have any resources or thoughts to share to solve this?",

        "Text": "Hey there, I got diagnosed with cptsd a while ago, due to long term traumatic events in an abusive household as a child. The aggressor was removed when I was 10 as we than moved away a year later. From childhood on all the way into my adolescent I had no therapy whatsoever, later in life I kept getting more problems around work that was not brain stimulating doing the same thing for hours on ends, day in day out, that I was seeing flashbacks from the time more and more, that I had pushed away. A year therapy later I was diagnosed with cptsd and autism, before I moved to Germany being in love there. I do wanna move back, as it wasn't what I was expecting and prob get diagnosed for ADHD.\n\n  \nIn my year therapy with my therapist she eventually asked me if I was willing to try out EMDR, she explained the treatment for me and how it should work. We tried it out and that for a couple times, yet it didn't have any good influence on me, and a friend of mine also did and it didn't have a good effect on her either. She stared inot it getting flashbacks too tough to handle for her, me I couldn't keep up with the lights. The idea is that you follow the lights while thinking of your trauma so that memories get rewritten or perhaps processed faster and less intense? That is the explanation I got from it. The thing is, I stared blankly ahead, and while she told me to go back to the time of trauma, it's like sitting in a cinema, watching your life go by in a couple scenes and you are just mentally not in the world. It did not work for me, but I am gonna ask you, reader, if you have PTSD or know someone who has and you or they had EMDR treatment, how did it go and did it work?",

        "Text": "I ended up diagnosed with PTSD after my two dogs (German Shepherd and a Shepherd mix) got into a really bad fight. One was elderly and had mobility issues so he couldn't fight back and I was seeing him be ripped apart in front of me, the screams of agony were the worst part of it. I ended up being bit badly trying to break it up and needed stitches. My elderly dog got over 100 staples in his head and neck. \n\nThe aggressor, my younger Shepherd was sent to a behavioural training center for a few months so we could figure out how to live safely with him. To be honest, I felt so incapable of handling this dogs issues that I wanted very badly to let his trainer adopt him. She was willing to and he was doing really well with her. My husband and his family fought hard against that and they won, the dog ended up coming home. Our older dog ended up going downhill healthwise and got put to sleep before our younger dog came home so I didn't have to worry about them getting into a fight but that only helped my fears inside the house, not outside. I made it clear to my husband that I was not capable of training this dog and that he needed to be able to do it without me. He agreed to that.\n\nI don't trust our dog and I don't want to be around him when there are other dogs around. My panic attacks are unbearable and that level of discomfort doesn't go away unless I remove myself from it. I've tried exposure therapy but with my bad luck, I ended up witnessing 2 more dog fights and it made my anxiety worse so I stopped doing it. Nowadays is not as bad as it was in the first few months, as I dont have night terrors or startle reactions to inane, unrelated things. But a year later, I still can't face being around my dog with other dogs. It's still too hard.\n\nMy husband and his family pressure me constantly to bring our dog to his parents house when we stop in or attend holiday dinners. His parents have 2 large dogs. I told my husband very clearly, either I go or the dog goes, not both. My husband will still try to bring the dog with us and makes me feel stupid for saying I can't handle that. He will even sometimes ask me why as if I haven't cried while telling him how much I hate that I can't control how my mind and body reacts and how ashamed and embarrassed I am of it. I've told him I've felt suicidal over it, especially in the beginning. Every time we visit his parents without the dogs, his mom asks \"wheres the dog?\" and will talk about how much my brother in law misses him and wants to see him. I thought for a long time that she just didn't know why he doesn't come when I'm there. I found out today that she's well aware of my issues so it feels like shes poking at it on purpose. Which feels so cruel and hurtful. It's a small thing but it really hurts me.\n\nIt's so hard to explain to people who have never had to deal with this themselves that the worst part of all of this is the shame. They don't need to make me feel stupid cause I already do. They don't need to make me feel bad cause I'm already riddled with guilt. The lack of understanding makes me feel like I'm defective and alone. All I want is support and I'm made to feel ridiculous, like I need to just get over it already cause it's annoying. I've told my husband he should feel very lucky that he doesn't understand.\n\nIs there anything I can do to help them understand or do I have to just be the bigger person and get a better handle on my feelings towards these ignorant remarks?",

But anyways I would look really sad and emo and people would call me a school shooter because of that. \n\nThe only good thing in my life at the point was I got good at running. After the end of the cross country season I was really trying to fit in so I was hanging out with my brother a lot trying to talk to his friends, which I really shouldn’t have done. I went to a party that was for seniors and everyone left me alone except for a guy on the team who made fun of me occasionally but it wasn’t bad until I interacted with him here, he was pretty much picking on me and at one point he starting pinching me and I just slapped his hand away. He was like “oh ok ok, Corey hold my beer” and then he bodyslammed me. There was literally nothing I could do, I was much weaker than he was and I would’ve just injured myself more. After that another point in the party I walked past him and then he shoved me and laughed. \n\nI had to leave after that. When summer practice started and I was talking to my friends getting all excited because I was excited for the season he was behind me with his click and was saying “look at this cringe kid, I actually through him on the ground at a party, it was easy.” And then he shoved me. I decided to shove him back but it was barely anything, because I was weaker than he was. \n\nAnother point at another practice he was running behind me and then he started making fun of me some more making fun of my physique. \n\nThere a lot more to this but this is the run up and the main things that make me angry every now and then. This was 5 years ago now and I still cannot get over it. From what I’ve heard so far the guy failed out of college and now works in insurance. I get so uncomfortable when I think of this I can’t focus on other things. \n\nI never told a teacher or anyone superior about this because of the stigma of being a snitch or pussy. Looking back on it I feel like I should’ve. It hurts me knowing I never got justice and so I look back constantly at how I could’ve handled things differently. I’m now much stronger than I was (I can bench about 210) and often think about getting payback but obviously I can’t risk getting charged given I’m actually doing good in college now. ",

        "Text": "   I’ve never posted anywhere for any advice. I can usually figure things out put this one. I’m literally not in control of the symptom and not aware when it’s happening so I’m at a loss. I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD, but I had a hard last year at my previous job. I started hearing air sirens, and loud sounds in my head when I’d “wake up” and it was like inception. I’d start getting ready and it would reset and at first I believed it was all just dreams until things in my room or moves and I was at various states of getting ready. Today I was going to start a new job for the first time in almost a year. I’ve used alarms previously sometimes I do sleep through them, but nothing is moved. I have not had any sleepwalking instances during that time but this morning although the job didn’t start for fairly late in the day I woke up after that thought wow I missed the loudest alarm clock I could find.!??? And then unfortunately I saw things moved in my room. I had started to get ready. There were things thrown across my bathroom floor. I tried to use paint as part of my make up. I have no knowledge of any of it. I have never been a sleepwalker and never happened to me until my previous job. And I thought it would go away. I thought it had gone away. It doesn’t help that my biggest fear that I’ve had in life for many years is doing things I don’t remember. I also obviously need a job and money. All of the doctors offices in my area a few months ago were booked out nine months. Maybe someone has an idea for online therapy. I honestly have no idea what a treatment for this would even be. \n  I hate that I am a person that really loves values and needs control and yet I’m having some moments that I am not even aware of.  I guess I also just need to hear from someone that might be going through this or has gone through it because I have never heard of this happening. At least no one told me it’s happened to them. Sorry if spelling is weird I used to talk to text and it won’t let me pull the cursor to the top and I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. PTSD has never previously been a concern nor has sleepwalking. I was slightly concerned about those things with my previous job, but I didn’t take it too seriously and I thought once I got out of the situation, everything would be fine. I will probably look up before bed meditations that might help. Or a certain sounds, I can set as my alarm that could mitigate this. I don’t want to have to ask someone to make sure I’m awake but I guess if it comes down to that. Has anyone else had this issue? Has anyone gotten PTSD from a job? Had inception dreams where you keep waking up waking up waking up only to discover it’s hours later and you’re standing in front of the bathroom mirror thinking you’re getting ready? I don’t know any of it. It’s scary for me. It’s something I’ve never imagined as a possibility. For myself or even a thing that could exist.",

My best friend and my partner both feel that I might have, at the very least that the shooting has deeply affected me. I'm starting to see where they're coming from, but I just can't bring myself to accept that the shooting could have affected me like that. \n\nMy biggest thing is that I saw it, and it happened maybe 10 feet away from me, but I didn't get hurt. I can't accept being so shaken up when I'm not even the one that got hurt, I was lucky enough to get away and call 911. \n\nI know my parents put a lot of doubt and minimization in me when it happened. They're very manipulative, abusive, and their favorite thing to do is to downplay the severity of any bad situation. I know good and well that they're like this and always have been, but their judgements still ring true in my head. I was still living with them at the time, and I came home super rattled, it took me a good 20 minutes to spit out what happened to them. My mom told me how sneaky and secretive I was for not immediately telling them about it (as is her way), then my parents went on to tell me that I should've expected it going to that shady bar at that time of night, that I'm just lucky that I got away without being hurt, that I don't need to be so rattled because it wasn't me who got beaten and shot. \n\nAnd I know that isn't exactly healthy or realistic judgement and behavior from them, but I think it set into place my doubt. I thought I was fine at first except for my reaction to noises. For the first few months since it happened (and still to this day), loud and sudden noises startled me a lot. I worked in a kitchen, and I vividly remember one day someone dropped several metal sheet pans and I jumped so high and felt the sound through my entire being. I just had to continue on with work as normal. I eventually quit because I couldn't handle the stress of the kitchen, it wreaked havoc on my anxiety (amongst other things). \n\nNow, I feel borderline agoraphobic. I always think someone in public is going to snap out, so I rarely leave our house. I always think I hear people in our yard yelling, about to break into our house. I even get it in my head that my partner and his family are angry with me and will start an argument with me or worse.\n\nI'm so tired. I just can't deal with this anymore. I can't live with constant fear that seeps deep into every fiber of my being anymore. I'm just so tired, and broken, and sometimes I feel like I'm about to break. \n\nThank you for reading.",
