I have sat with many ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù throughout my life, missed diagnosed too many times to count, and told for the most part to suck it up buttercup. Growing up in rural USA, I was always told that depression and anxiety are ‚Äújust part of life‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even lying gang when I tell you that a ‚Äúpsychiatrist‚Äù told me that when I was 14. \n\nFast forward 25 years down my path and I‚Äôve finally found a doctor that knows what she is doing. We‚Äôve been seeing each other for a year now and she‚Äôs just now getting comfortable diagnosing me bipolar2. Do you know how many fucking ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù I‚Äôve seen growing up for this shit that all just told me I‚Äôm fine and discharged me after 3 visits? Well over a dozen! I‚Äôve been ‚Äúrawdogging‚Äù life for the better part of 30 years.\n\nSleep has always been an illusion to me. Most of my adult life I have been living off 3-4 hours of extremely interrupted sleep a night. Trazadone has been helping me get 6 solid hours a night but when I travel for work, I fall right back into 3 hours max. The last work trip sent me into hypomania that I am just coming out of (almost 2 months). \n\nToday during my visit she prescribed me Klonopin for traveling. I‚Äôm well aware of the risks that go with it and am not a fan of downers so I‚Äôm not worried about an addiction forming. She gave me 10-1mg, start with .5mg if it doesn‚Äôt help, take 1mg following night, and would prefer for me to have some left at our next visit in a month. I‚Äôll report back in 2 weeks after work trip if anyone cares. \n\nI don‚Äôt really know where I‚Äôm going with all of this other than an appreciation post for my psychiatrist. For the first time in well over 30 years, I can say that the last 4 months of my life have been the most eye opening and rewarding months of my life. A lot of that is because of her and the care she provides.\n\nLove each other but more importantly, love yourself. \n\nAnd yes, this post is just another piece of evidence to my hypomania episode üòÇ",

He is in uni but can't pass his classes and doesn't hold a job. I truly love my husband and don't even have a problem with doing all the work. Seeing him happy and just having him beside me is enough for me. But he stopped his meds. I talked to him about it but he wouldn't listen. He went into psychosis. Said horrible things. Decided he didn't love me. Then due to his erotomania he started pursuing another girl (from his past that he also had a previous clashing with due to erotomania during previous psychosis before our marriage). My husband used to love me. Now he despises me. And then he started getting lost, disturbed the girl at work (she has a boyfriend and only knows my husband by name), got into legal troubles, used up my savings...until I had to get him hospitalized. He hates me for it. Will he ever love me again? Will this nightmare be over? ",

        "Text": "**TL,DR:** is anyone else exclusively focused on getting rid of the depression, and actually quite happy with their hypomanic phases?\n\nHi all, trying to get a better understanding of this relatively new diagnosis: I'm apparently bipolar, as evidenced by talking to a psychiatrist for about 30 mins, but also supported by my therapist of about 2 years. Been aware of this for about 3 months now.\n\nHowever in my case, my 'hypomanic' phases are pretty much completely awesome: I get a lot done, everything excites me, I meet new people, I get new job opportunities, start new hobbies... it's basically these periods that drive everything positive in my life. Sure, I sleep very badly, and I get anxious and afraid a lot (because it feels like I have so much to lose), and I sleep around a lot and party and do drugs - but aside from that, I don't experience any of the side effects I sometimes see mentioned on this sub. Excessive spending, irritability, anger, gambling, etc... Honestly, if I could live in a permanent state of this hypomania, I would.\n\nOn the other hand, when I get depressed it absolutely destroys me for weeks at a time. Everything I've built (relationships, hobbies, new projects, sport) crumbles into a pit of nothingness, I become obsessed with suicidal ideation and I completely isolate from everyone around me. I spend days crying on my own and wishing I could press a button to just end it all. I still drink a lot during these phases (though less than during the up swings admittedly) and I occasionally try to escape and do a bunch of drugs - which doesn't really help in the long run, but totally helps short term. \n\nAnyone else have this 'type' of bipolar disorder, or am I in a minority? I'm still trying to figure out if this diagnosis is 'real'. I get worried when I try a new drug (tried Lithium and Abilify so far, currently off both because neither worked) and it's main effect is described as 'reducing mood swings' or 'stabilising mood'. I just want to not be depressed anymore, I don't care about being more stable. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.",

        "Text": "Hello folks! Diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, Bipolar 2, fibromyalgia, migraines (without aura, though I've had 1 with aura and I switched my birth control and no more aura after that), Ehler's Danlos Hypermobility, GERD. I was also previously diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder, but I don't believe I'd fit the criteria now and am unsure if I ever truly did.\n\n  \nWith that out of the way - if anyone is like me and wants some hope, I wanted to post this as a positive story.\n\nI have tried multiple medications over the last 10 years. \n\n  \nNo stimulants work for me (adderall, vyvanse, ritalin, modafinil), they triggered a serious bout of anhedonia. The two times I tried SSRIs (prior to bipolar 2 diagnosis) I shifted between dimensions and hallucinated. Lamictal had me angry and mean.  Lithium had me unable to get off the couch. Seroquel dissociated me. And on, and on.\n\nI am now on:\n\nAbilify 2mg - Trintellix 10mg - guanfacine er 1mg - lamictal 100mg 2/day - gabapentin throughout the day 200mg-300mg per dose - I have also done TMS a couple of times in the past years and have done ketamine treatment (both spravato in office and through the mail)\n\nNon psych meds are pantoprazole, aimovig (for migraines. If you have migraines I recommend looking into this), rizatriptan, albuterol, flonase. I also take a vitamin d and biotin supplement.\n\n  \nMy personal, anecdotal experiences are:\n\n\\- started abilify 5 years ago, and it worked so wonderfully for me. Stabilized me a lot, helped my emotional outbursts, etc. It certainly didn't fix everything, but made it much more manageable. Hypomanic episodes diminished in frequency and severity vy a ton, but it stabilized me pretty low. I was still having prolonged, severe depressive episodes.\n\n\\- started lamictal about 6 months afgo. Even though it didn't work before, the abilify gave me hope that maybe it would be different. And it was. It helped with my depression and stabilization in general a fuckton. It boosted my mood a lot, not hypomanically at all, I just felt actually capable. That dropped off after a minute, and I was stable, but still had mild-moderate depression. Prior to the lamictal I was dealing with the anhedonia from stimulants, and it broke me through to the surface finally.\n\n\\- started trintellix 3 months ago (well, I started it before then, but then changing insurance meant I was without it for quite a bit). So far fantastic. I am stabilized in a pretty good place. I will always carry the weight of depression with me, but I've been able to slowly dip my toes into doing hobbies and having interests again. \n\nguanfacine - absolutely wonderful for my adhd. Helps with my brain fog. A lot of the time I feel like my consciousness doesn't fully \"fill\" the space in my body, This has helped that a ton. I feel much more present, and it makes it a lot easier to start my day instead of sitting at my dining table staring for the first hours of the morning.\n\ngabapentin - has helped with my anxiety and sleep quality a ton\n\ntms - this was SO HELPFUL for my depression. Unfortunately for me, I started adderall during treatment, and it completely cut through all the progress, and while future treatments would help mildly I never saw the improvement from the first treatment\n\nketamine/spravato - honestly, spravato treatment is ideal if you can access it. ketamine has two parts (as far as I understand) called enantiomers that are mirror images of each other. Mail order ketamine is going to be racemic (containing both R/S ketamine) and spravato is essentially the (S) ketamine. I found it to be way more therapeutic than racemic personally, but ymmv.\n\nAnyways - I feel the best I have in my life. And I don't mean gogogogogo happyhappyhappy madmadmad irritable constant rubberbanding of my hypomanic (mixed?) episodes. I just feel capable. I sit outside and drink my tea because I have the energy and motivation to. I have been reading again. I've been playing video games. I have been journaling instead of just staring at the blank pages. I am better able to regulate my emotions, and I can experience all of them - and they don't feel numb or dulled! I can experience sadness fully BUT handle it. I can experience joy without it being nearly physically overwhelming.\n\nIt hasn't been long on my meds, but I am extremely happy to even just have this time of contentment and softness even if it doesn't last forever.\n\nKeep trying. I am very blessed to have had a low OOP insurance limit and good doctors for a time. Find doctors who work with you and believe what you're saying about YOUR experience. Don't be afraid to research your own meds and what you think will work for you. You can do it. It's hard but the work is so worth it. You deserve to live a happy and full life and the people who love you want to see you happy - and even now if you're in a situation with people who are antagonists in your life helping your mental health will give you the motivation, energy, and belief that you can leave them and find people who truly cherish you - and during that finding of your community you will be more capable of finding and being content with yourself.\n\nBest wishes to you all <3 I will never be cured of any of this and I will always have to fight through both my own demons and the demons of health insurance when it all clicks into place it is so worth it.\n\nYou only live once so you might as well fight to make it a life worth living, you are the person who knows yourself best, and you are your own greatest advocate.\n\nBest of luck out there <3\n\n",

I cannot live with my feeling and no matter how dead or shitty I look nobody seems to care and I know it might be real selfish of me to want other people to see  the pain that I‚Äôm feeling like I see theirs but I mean I lost 50 lbs in the span of 3 months and my mom judges me, my best friends tell me I should be happy to be skinny, I have bags under my eyes that are so dark they look like I put purple makeup around my eyes, my eyes are always red from crying and I‚Äôm always lost in my thoughts‚Ä¶ how can you not see? It‚Äôs hurting me so bad. Even the guy I am talking to at the moment seems to treat me like I‚Äôm only here to save him while I‚Äôm drowning and I‚Äôm so stupid because I always show up with a stupid smile on my face ready to help everyone while I am barely hanging on by a thread myself. Talking about the guy I am talking to I like him but I don‚Äôt feel like he likes me enough to even understand how I feel no matter how much I tell him. The second something is wrong with him I known by his tone or way of saying things. Actually scratch that, that stands for everyone in my life‚Ä¶ I always know how they feel without having to ask but no matter how I explain to them how deep I‚Äôm drowning they don‚Äôt seem to care. One day when I was SUPERRRR drunk I told my mom I got Sa‚Äôd when I was younger, I was crying, had snot coming out my nose and I everything and she told me she couldn‚Äôt believe me‚Ä¶ me her own daughter. I cannot hold any relationship with anyone because of how I am anyways they all end up leaving. My room has been a complete mess for about 6 months now, i have barely been eating, talking or even thinking‚Ä¶ my brain has been empty and I‚Äôve just been waiting for someone to put me out of my misery bc I know that if I was to doing myself I would still feel guilt even in the after life if there is one.. anyways idk how I feel half the time and it‚Äôs making me miserable \n\n\nAnyways thank you for reading if u did and I‚Äôm happy I could tell at least one person how I really feel‚Ä¶",

I‚Äôve had problems getting a f****** appointment with a psychiatrist here. We had to get our local government official involved. Finally got an appointment after two trips to emergency, multiple calls to the GP, multiple calls to the CRISIS line, etc. The appointment was set for October 7, after I came back from a visit to my family in the states. I went to visit in the states and my mom made me go to the ER for severe depression, where they arranged for an inpatient stay. At the inpatient stay, they put me on Wellbutrin and Abilify. Had the appointment on October 7 and it was a f****** intake appointment where they had no power to prescribe or refill prescriptions. I felt great on those two meds. I was productive. I was working out. I was doing chores. I was walking the dog and helping my husband around the house. Then I ran out. I went back to fatigue and sadness, and some up days, but not many. They set another appointment, this time with a prescriber. That occurred today. He wants to put me on lithium instead of the Abilify and he‚Äôs refusing to prescribe wellbutrin, saying it‚Äôs on a ‚Äúblack list‚Äù of some sort. I did research when I got home. It‚Äôs available in the UK. It‚Äôs for treatment resistant depression. He is able to prescribe it with approval from a higher psychiatrist, if two antidepressants have been ineffective (they have my medical records from the states, I‚Äôve been on at least two). I felt HUMAN on those drugs. I just want to be productive and not tired and not fatigued all the time. I want to be not sad. WHY do I have to work so hard to get what I need?! I cried before the appointment because I was afraid this was going to happen. Anyway. Reasons not to be afraid of lithium?",

He believes that I engage my right brain more often than my left brain and that it might be more beneficial for me to find techniques rooted in creativity.

sure, and it's the equivalent of trying to hold unset jello, i won't get anything done. the distress from those pattern breaks is there of course, but the distress of trying to hold to my normal patterns and not feel like i'm being assaulted by my own brain all day long is just so significantly worse.\n\ni think that's really been the most upsetting and unnerving part of having bp2 symptoms present in my late 20s is just that i always felt like i was very clear headed and sharp, as much as i struggled with a lot of other things, I knew how to do that- to think straight and focus, and i knew how to regulate some of my dysfunctional parts! but now, when i'm hypomanic, having my brain feel like a pot of scrambled eggs that's overfilled and starting to slosh all over the stove, rather than a machine that i can oil, understand, and care for in a more systematic way is. frustrating.\n\njust needed to get that out, and maybe it resonates with a couple ppl?? i feel like sometimes being autistic makes my bp2 symptoms present a little differently from non-autistic folk, and it's sorta hard to find other ppls discussions on it because they're mostly discussions about autism/bipolar misdiagnosis, and.... nope, according to psych, i got real lucky ‚úåÔ∏è lamictal has been INSANELY effective for getting rid of a depression i was in that was so much deeper than i realized, so i'm gonna talk to docs abt something i can take to level out the highs, because. UGH üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è\n\nnot necessarily the point of this post, but if you've had a medication work well for you for similar symptoms, I would love to hear any anecdotal accounts of success in dealing with similar symptoms! i did mention this to my psych before but he seemed a little hesitant to add another medication at that point when we were still figuring out the lamictal, but i'm gonna press it because i don't feel like this is a change in function i can willpower or therapy-strategies my way over, just like the depression turned out to literally nearly evaporate once i hit 100mg on lamictal after years of trying everything i could!",

        "Text": "Curious what folks‚Äô experience with Latuda and weight gain is. \n\nI‚Äôve been on a lot of different med combos in the past 2.5 years and recently switched to taking Latuda as my daily med. Since the end of August I was on a low dose but I‚Äôm on 60mg/day now and have been for the past 6 weeks. I‚Äôm also prescribed olanzapine as needed to prevent mania but I have taken it like 3 x only the past 6 weeks so that‚Äôs not really my issue here. \n\nI‚Äôm torn because I think the Latuda has really helped me feel more balanced and the past 6 weeks since my dosage increase have been the best I‚Äôve felt in 2.5 years. HOWEVER, I‚Äôm noticing I‚Äôm gaining weight. I‚Äôve always been a highly active and very fit person and now putting on a bunch of weight is really, really bugging me. It‚Äôs like I have to choose between my mental health/stability and my body which totally sucks. \n\nNoticing this weight gain for the past 8 weeks I‚Äôve been exercising 6/days a week, trail running 1-2 hours 3x a week and strength training 3 days a week. I literally only take 1 full rest day a week off training. I‚Äôm also out walking my dog every day. I honestly don‚Äôt think I could be doing anything more from an exercise effort perspective to avoid weight gain. I also eat very healthy, lots of vegetables and proteins. I enjoy chocolate the odd day but nothing insane. Drinks lots of water too and avoid processed foods. \n\nI‚Äôve had a really rough 2.5 years. I was battling addiction and related overdoses for some of that, a very serious suicide attempt, and lots of bipolar related psych ward stays. It has really sucked. Finally I have a good job that‚Äôs perfect for me, a positive change of direction in life, I don‚Äôt feel suicidal and haven‚Äôt had any recent major high and low prolonged mood swings. I‚Äôm really grateful for everything and the recent stability from medication. Gaining weight because of if though really sucks! \n\nHas anyone had weight gain issues on Latuda and has anyone successfully taken weight loss medication at the same time to prevent gains?",

And it's never really that serious as deep down ik it's finite and doesn't last. \n\nBut I'm wondering if maybe I just have ADHD as I don't think me being hyper is ever really that serious. I don't go out and rob banks, or spend all my life savings and become broke. I'm just hyper and happy and honestly optimistic. I'm very productive when hyper. And I've seen movies with bipolar characters and I just don't think I'm that extreme. \n\nI just get very chatty and happy and charismatic. I'm honestly my best self when I'm giddy, everyone prefers me giddy rather than depressed and im able to have an interest in sex and be more normal.

He immediately put me on lamotrigine (last May). Now on 400mg. Completely put my intensely deep hopelessness over the last couple years (mainly about being so held down by Bipolar itself) upside down. All of the sudden I had control again, and had total clarity of mind (although very forgetful lol). Worked through a lot. The scheme I made with my psychologist is a good fruit of that work.\n\nMy new psychiatrist, who is my psychologist's boss & a big shot professor on bipolar, apparently was very enthousiastic with it. He asked for permission to show this (anonymized) scheme, to show his academic peers. As a fellow academic (structural biology postdoc, until burnout) that made me happier than publishing my own Science paper, lol. \n\nOfc that kind of high level functioning shit caused the burnout in the first place. I'm stepping away from that academic career rn, because it just takes, without giving me any dopamine back.\n\nThere's a lot of hard work ahead with my psychologist. Figuring out relationships, and finding a new profession that much better suits my strengths and weaknesses (ADHD in mind), with time pressure, also dealing with my now-estranged undiagnosed bipolar dad... Wish me luck!! I'll need it... But I'm just hopeful now!!\n\nJust so stoked about all this!!! Wanted to share this positive story!\n\nLove you guys, you have IMMENSELY helped me. My psych claims \"remission\" already. Lamotrigine was the breakthrough. Lmk if you want to know more details about my story :) might make a post. \n\nIf you want to get my Excel file, I'll try to send it to you (Does that work on Reddit/DMs??). Bit of a work of love.\n\nCheers and love my bipolar buddies here ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",

I had my moods pretty well under control, I hadn‚Äôt had any episodes since around April when I got my meds under control. \n\nAbout a month ago, my psych and I decided I was doing well enough to try stimulants for my adhd, and they were working really well. Or I thought they were. After the first couple doses I noticed a lot of improvement, I was trying to be hyper vigilant about watching for hypomanic episodes, but I thought everything happening was just a coincidence and I wrote it off. I was barely sleeping but somehow still had energy for work (I work 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week, overnights), I was super positive most of the time, i was spending quite a bit of money, but I wrote all of it off for having a good reason, and it was just a bunch of coincidences in a row. \n\nBut then about a week ago I started coming down, and down, and down. And I don‚Äôt know what is what anymore. I haven‚Äôt taken my adhd meds since then because I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre making it happen or not. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I really was just doing well and the election (the whole situation around the election has been really difficult on me mentally and it‚Äôs been a rough week) just triggered a depressive episode, or if I was hypo and I just happened to snap out of  it and start crashing at the same time, just by chance. \n\nAnd now I‚Äôm just so lost, I‚Äôve been sleeping through alarms and phone calls, falling asleep without showering, forgetting to feed my bearded dragon, not doing dishes or cleaning my apartment. I just recently got into an apartment fully on my own, no roommates, no parents, just me, my cat, and my beardie, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm just going to fall apart. Sometimes I think about rejoining my bearded dragon or surrendering him because I love him so much but I get worried that I can‚Äôt take care of him properly. I have the funds and I have the want, but I don‚Äôt always feel like I have the ability or that I can consistently keep up his care. I just have so much shame around it and I don‚Äôt know what to do.\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs my cat who I love more than anything in the world and he‚Äôs so precious but I think he‚Äôs be happier with a sibling to play with, but I don‚Äôt know if I can take care of another cat when I can barely take care of myself. \n\nI just feel awful. And I‚Äôm seeing my psych in the morning and I know I need to be honest but I don‚Äôt fully know how to be honest, I‚Äôve never been good at vulnerability.\n\nAnyways, there‚Äôs all that.",

I think it‚Äôs been a downtrend for the last couple of weeks. I‚Äôve started sleeping later, and later.. I‚Äôve called out of work a lot and can barely stand the 12 hours I‚Äôm there when I am there. \n\nI don‚Äôt even want to drive away and never come back like usual, I just want to rot. To sleep. I don‚Äôt want to move. This episode of depression feels worse than I think mine usually did, or I‚Äôve been doing so well that I forgot how to cope and continue on. \n\nI‚Äôm thinking of sending a text to my provider saying I‚Äôm having a crisis and need some time off work and maybe an adjustment. The thing is though I‚Äôve NEVER done that. I‚Äôve been very lucky to have never been hospitalized. The one time I probably should have been hospitalized I just brought my mattress to my parents house, threw it on the floor of my brothers bedroom and didn‚Äôt leave until I thought I was safe to be with myself. \n\nI could do the same thing, but now I have a fianc√© and pets. It would feel so weird in this stage in life. And honestly I‚Äôm thinking maybe I do need some kind of help my inpatient provider can‚Äôt give me. I‚Äôve never been hospitalized, I don‚Äôt want to be, but I‚Äôm scared and I don‚Äôt know if time off of work is going to be enough. I don‚Äôt want to play with my meds because at the end of the day, I know this will never go away completely, and for the most part I live a fairly stable life. I take my meds, have never stopped them even during my highest highs and lowest lows. I‚Äôve held the same job, and when I was close to using it my manager begged me to get accommodations made with HR, and I did. They‚Äôve helped. \n\nI‚Äôm so scared to take even more time off. I get 3 days a month if needed, and I already used them this month. I feel like an awful employee. I think I just need to talk into the void and see if anyone listens. You all in this subreddit understand more than any person within arms reach. \n\nHave any of you voluntarily gone to the hospital? Just taken time off of work? I think I just need some advice on what may be best. \n\nAt minimum tell me your favorite coping mechanism that gets you through the day at work. I work in a children‚Äôs hospital and I love it, but right now even that light is dim.",

        "Text": "OK so this is something I only noticed once I started meds and my hypomania became a lot less intense. Before meds, when I was hypomanic I felt pretty much the same throughout the whole episode. It didn't feel like a collection of symptoms, but more like an all-encompassing state of mind.\n\nNow that I'm medicated, I have noticed something strange. After a couple of stressful weeks filled with anxiety, anger and loss of motivation, I've started feeling like I'm in the prodrome of a hypomanic episode for the past 5 days or so. You know the drill: I'm optimistic (a drastic change from last week), more active, more social, I'm online shopping, planning a trip to the hairstylist to dye my hair red again... Still, I don't feel 100% hypomanic. \n\nWhen I wasn't on meds I felt this constant amount of joy and excitement, but now I just feel... \"normal\", with some random little sparks. I've noticed that throghout the day something will happen (like a random stimulus, seeing \"signs\" and coincidences, or thinking about what I'm gonna wear to my friends' birthday this weekend), and I feel hypomanic for a few seconds or minutes. It's like I get hit with a sudden wave of happiness, pleasure and excitement. It feels exactly like pre-med hypomania, but in these little bursts, almost like the meds are suppressing it, and I‚Äôm just getting these glimpses of what it would normally feel like.\n\nI don't even know if this makes sense or if there's even a question behind it, I'm just ranting at this point. Still, I've been noticing this weird sudden sensation and I thought I'd share it here in case someone else has felt this!",

She has been like this my whole life, and her refusal to be treated made my childhood a living hell. She was and still is abusive, verbally, physically and emotionally. I was picked up and thrown by my hair, called stupid, ugly and fat, she told my friends families that I was a horrible kid while we were waiting in line for my senior night in high school. She once said ‚Äú I wish I could throw this so hard it would cut your jugular and you would die‚Äù while holding an empty diet cherry coke can.

It will be one year on November 25th, and I want to start trying for a baby. Multiple of our friends have had babies over the last few years and it has made both of us want to have one of our own, but we are scared that I will turn out like my mom. \n\nI was diagnosed earlier this year and I haven‚Äôt missed a dose of my meds. I am doing everything I can to try to prevent being like my mother, but I‚Äôve had some explosive and violent episodes that I know can‚Äôt happen if I had a baby. I think they may be caused by my depression medication, Wellbutrin, as the aggression and violence started after I started taking it before my bipolar was diagnosed, but hasn‚Äôt improved much after the diagnosis. Even if I wasn‚Äôt having those episodes m, I am still afraid of making my future children suffer like I did. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to be like her. I don‚Äôt want to ruin their lives. ",

        "Text": "I am between a borderline personality diagnosis and a bipolar 2 diagnosis as we speak. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but I was hoping for some extra validation to see if my symptoms line up with anyone else's experience. \n\nFor clarification, I'm starting to believe I have both of these disorders. \n\nMy journey has been ongoing my whole life, but the pinnacle was January of this year. I had my first major panic attack in my sleep. Now I know nocturnal panic is normal for panic disorder and highly anxious individuals, but the panic attack itself and what happened during it freaks me out and is what I believe is possibly a feature of hypomania or a mixed episode. \n\nDuring this panic attack I literally woke up in My living room, mid-Sprint, I broke my toe while sprinting out of bed and came to awareness while running in the living room. I had never had a panic attack before, so proceeded to scream that I was dying. I ended up falling, probably due to my broken toe and then the panic attack ended. This whole thing lasted like 20 seconds. \n\nI had another one similar to this, a few months later. I was on propranolol at the time, so I think it kind of lowered the panic, but again I woke up mid-sprint this time my grandmother's living room. \n\nThis sent me down a 10-month journey until now of dealing with panic disorder and doing exposure therapy. I had deduced I had developed a phobia of panic attacks themselves.\n\nI seem to be sprinting to the closest person I know during both of these events. I don't remember if I was dreaming or having nightmares and I don't remember getting out of bed. As you can surmise these panic attacks are very irregular, I've never read a story of someone who matches up with mine until I came to this thread and saw that there were people with kind of similar experiences. \n\nThis sent me down a 10-month journey of dealing with panic disorder and exposure therapy. I was borderline agoraphobic. But I do feel as though I'm doing so much better now after utilizing dare.\n\nWhat bothers me, is the state I'm in during and around these two panic attacks. The first thing I noticed is that my dreams are extremely vivided and extremely bizarre. Mostly nightmares. Again I don't remember what I was dreaming about during my panic attacks but on previous nights and nights after I've had night terrors. The dreams are extremely vivid and revolve around themes such as the world ending and Jesus and Satan (I was raised very religious. I'm not anymore). On top of that my sleep quality is extremely terrible waking up 5-10 per night and never feeling like I'm reaching a deep sleep. The entire time my body is exhausted and I want to sleep, I yearn for it. But there's like this energy in my chest area that keeps me awake and my thoughts racing. The energy is so intense in my chest that it drives my anxiety getting intrusive thoughts about crashing out or exploding or not being able to control my actions. \n\nDuring this time of panic disorder I've gotten very familiar with dissociation, and I kind of know my way around it. I might be dissociated during these times but the feeling itself of heightened energy does not seem like it's caused by dissociation or anxiety. \n\nDuring these episodes there's probably one or two max nights where I don't sleep at all and go to work the next day on zero sleep. I still feel like s*** but it just feels like I have an energy carrying me through the day. Other than that I probably average anywhere from 2 to 5 hours of sleep.\n\nIn between these episodes, I believe I might be experiencing depressive rebounds. Or the world feels heavy my body feels like lead I feel like I have to drag my chest and body through life. My chest can sometimes feel like it's in my tummy.\n\nThe only thing that trips me up is the fact that there are events around these that could be triggers. I'm very sure that I do have BPD, I have severe abandonment issues, my father's a narcissist, and I was neglected through childhood. Before my first panic attack I was going through a divorce and my wife was cheating on me. My second panic attack I felt alone and I was scared and I was by myself. (My grandmother has narcissistic traits and I was only there because I feared my safety alone. I still felt very alone and isolated with her)\n\nI got \"lucky\" a few months ago, and had a massive panic attack while awake. I was able to sit through this one and do a proper exposure therapy without getting out of my chair and running. However, I don't believe I was manic during this time. \n\nI'm currently in what I feel is another manic episode. And again it started with a feeling of abandonment and aloneness. Lots of pain emotionally and in my chest that I believe is connected to my past trauma. The night before last I got about 4 hours of sleep, last night I got about 1 hour. Again I can tell I'm exhausted I can tell I'm tired, I can tell I need sleep, but it just feels like a pipe is loose and dumping all this energy into my body. \n\nI also have this weird feeling like something is missing, like part of my awareness isn't there. It's weird it's almost impossible to identify. It's like I'm lacking all object permanence and all emotional permanence. As I fall asleep at night I tunnel vision so deeply on my symptoms that it's like everything around it disappears and I become the symptom. My intrusive thoughts switch from narrative to visual. I almost get these dream like intrusive visuals as I'm trying to fall asleep that seem connected to anxiety sensations. They're all very bizarre and I'm trying not to make meaning out of them. walls moving in too close to me, white hot fire, blood dripping. And each time this happens I wake up, I feel almost confused for a split second and my body feels like it's kind of sitting up on its own. It's scary, and I almost feel pulled into them. My brain feels kind of broken as I type this.\n\nI'm having trouble sitting still, can't relax into my body. Another weird thing is as soon as the sun came up I was actually able to fall asleep. Obviously there's an extreme anxiety element here, it just feels so different in this current state than in what I would call my normal state. \n\nI don't really have anyone to talk about these things besides my therapist. I just turned 26 and I'm about to fall off my parents insurance so I will lose my therapist while I try to find new insurance which is really hard to bring myself to do when I feel this way. I feel very alone. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that my obsessive nature is way more extreme now. And I can't stop but obsessing about the way I feel. It's like hypomania but the obsession is on the hypomania. I almost feel like I developed a fear of the hypomania. I say this as I think I've experienced hypomania many times throughout my life, but I never really reached out for help until I developed panic disorder. The panic disorder itself is almost worse, which then is even worse when I'm in this state.\n\nI just feel so stressed out. It's also worth mentioning that I'm not really irritable at all really. Just internal angst, but I actually feel like my demeanor towards others is calm and pretty collected. My only symptom outside of that is I'm talking a lot more than usual, cutting people off more than usual. \n\nI'm sorry if my writing is bad. I used voice to text to write this out as I drive to work. \n\nTldr: I think I'm hypomanic.",

        "Text": "With my closest friends my relationships can be strained by my intense emotions and mood swings. Many of them don‚Äôt know about me having bipolar and some do. All of my friends are amazing and I appreciate them so much, but I want to find healthy ways to manage my emotions so I don‚Äôt push them away. \n\nI can be overly eager to hangout in hypomanic or positive time periods, I don‚Äôt want friends to feel bad for saying no or for our hangouts feel like an obligation. I worry that asking to hangout again too soon comes off as clingy, even though when I do hang with any of them it is a ton of fun. I can also be too talkative or active on social media, which I‚Äôd rather use less of and be more present. How do I hold myself back from being too social?\n\nWhen I‚Äôm depressed I avoid socializing, and can often flake on my friends. I tend to look for excuses for why Im hiding from the world. I get so anxious that I can barely handle meeting new people (friends of friends). I overthink plans with friends of my friends sooo much before they happen, i ruminate believing that they are going to dislike me and that everyone else would have more fun without me there. I‚Äôm terrified that hanging in a group with new people will make my friends realize that I am not worth keeping as a friend. I will stress about meeting new people for days and days, it will be constantly on my mind and I am genuinely terrified. I do the same with work events or any social gatherings. It also feels like I‚Äôm worthless if a friend is too busy hangout, even when I know they‚Äôre genuinely busy and they do want to actually hang i overthink and assume they‚Äôre avoiding me when they arnt. I try to hide my problems as much as possible but I share with a couple of my friends who I trust but I would rather keep more of my struggles private so I do not push away my friends. The most I really say is that I‚Äôve been depressed lately, or complain about losing sleep I don‚Äôt get very detailed, and when I do actually open up I end up regretting it later or feeling embarrassed. \n\nI‚Äôm starting counselling through my work and I‚Äôm hoping to address these issues. Is anyone else similar to me and could share some advice or techniques that worked for them? How do you separate or compartmentalize your emotions from friendships? I do it with work constantly, but struggling to keep my emotions hidden with friends.  ",

        "Text": "Saturday was a stressful day. My husband got decently drunk and was doing things that were kind of embarrassing for me. And flat out obnoxious. \n\nWe all went to a bar afterwards and his friend got REALLY drunk. At some point my husband didn't realize I was right behind him and I got smacked in the face, hard. I told him I wanted to leave in 15 minutes and he said no problem and closes out but then his drunk friend started having his own crisis and my husband (being who he is) started caring for him. \n\nDuring that, these two guys are looking at them judging them (they close and my husband his holding his friend) that pisses me off so I go over and I'm like \"is there a problem? Are you finding this entertaining?\"\n\nMy husband takes his friend outside and THREE HOURS LATER they try to come back in and the door guys (who previously had to clean up a spill and broken glass by us and we're very irritated by that) stopped them and said they couldn't come back in. I'm already annoyed at these guys because we have them $20 as a sorry for the mess and they were like \"wow cool bro, thanks\" very sarcastically making a point that they didn't give a shit (but still took the money of course). \n\nMy husband says that they're leaving, he just needs to get his wife (me). The guys say \"too bad\" and make them leave. As theyre leaving one of them snaps a picture of my husband and that pissed me off even more. \n\nI go up and I'm like \"you can't just let him come get his fucking wife? You know who I am! You knew I was sitting right there? What the fuck is your problem?!\" Then I leave with the remaining friends. \n\nWe're a decent ways away from the bar when something just snaps in me and I storm back without anybody in my group noticing. I start demanding they delete the photo of my husband and they're being cocky as fuck. The one guy is in my face telling me to leave and I just want to rip something to shreds. \n\nHis glasses are staring at me so I go to grab them of and break them but decide that's a bad idea and the last minute but not before making contact with his face. He grabs me by the collar and picks me up to literally throw me out. My husband see's this (not knowing I was the aggressor) and comes charging and shoves one of them HARD. When he does he slips and the guy that had me grabs him from behind and starts choking him. Five other guys pile on top. My husband's face is turning purple and I'm screaming at them to let go. \n\nHe finally gets out of the choke hold and we leave but they've called the cops. At the end of the day, we both got criminal trespassing charges. I know I could have been way worse. Pretty sure the cops were like, choking isn't an acceptable form of detainment so you might not want to go with assault charges because they can turn right around and fight excessive force on you. \n\nI haven't had a break like that in YEARS! I almost got my husband put in jail. I'm ashamed and a little scared honestly.",

Other vitamins are also important including B612/folic acid, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc. \n* Celsius the energy drink is kind of a good bipolar drink because they're balancing the caffeine against amino acids. \n* I'm not sure how much it helps, but I take both lithium orotate 10 mg and taurine 1 g as soon as I wake up in the morning. \n* Passionflower is helpful for sleep.\n* NAC is probably good but I have mast cell issues so it never really worked for me.\n\nSo far the meds that did end up working for me are super low dose gabapentin, strattera, and clonidine. But I think my brain is super weird and doesn't need a lot of meds.",

Sometimes my impulses get the best of me and i give in lol but I try my best to stick to the 6 mo. waiting period. \n\nAt 6 months I assume that I am no longer under the influence of hypomania/mentally impaired so I reckon that whatever it is, must be a genuine desire that I have.\n\nAn example of this, I was obsessed with becoming a veterinarian/going to vet school over the spring/summer of this year despite already having an established career with a degree in petroleum engineering. I was willing to drop everything to start taking pre vet courses asap. \n\nFast forward to now, I still want to become a vet and have recently applied to a pre vet program at a local university. Instead of impulsively quiting my job and moving to the college area where i assumed id eventually get accepted to/upending my life. \n\nMy current plan, if i am accepted into the pre vet program, is to continue working until the semester starts (i applied for next fall to save money) and move closer to the college when i am able to. If I am not accepted I will enroll as a non-degree seeking student to complete the courses I need. To be honest, you don't need a degree to apply to vet school. You only need to complete the vet school admission course prerequisites to apply to a DVM program. So I think applying to a full time program is unnecessary. \n\nAnywho, I will begin volunteering at a local vet clinic or animal shelter once I am accepted to the pre-vet program, hopefully I'll start volunteering either this coming Dec. or Jan. pending if I am accepted to university.",

That‚Äôs the only allergic reaction I‚Äôve ever had for anything so I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing now is an allergic reaction, a side effect, or nothing. But it‚Äôs a constant itch all over my body. \n\nEdit: I am also getting really bad headaches since starting the trileptal and nothing seems to help them. I‚Äôve tried drinking more water, drinking electrolyte drinks, drinking caffeine, taking Tylenol, and warm and cold rags on my head. Nothing has helped the headaches. I never got headaches before starting the new medication 3 days ago and I have had one everyday since taking it. ",

        "Text": "Does anyone else here have no clue how to do friendships and/or relationships that last?\n\nI‚Äôm 33. Right now I have two friends, both live interstate where I used to live. One is a former neighbour, we text but it‚Äôs mainly about a special interest (interior design) with the occasional peppering in of personal stuff. My other friend is quite a lot older, married with kids in high school and straddles the border of friend/motherly figure. I worked with her at my former workplace, a university, for a decade. She has unexpectedly been a huge support for me/stood by me while everyone else I thought was a friend bailed or literally treated me like I was crazy to the point of needing hospitalisation when I didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre not the closest friends I‚Äôve had by a long shot. We didn‚Äôt ever really ‚Äúhang out‚Äù in a way I associate with previous friendships in my life but they nevertheless are around and I‚Äôm grateful for them. I have no friends that I see in person though, since fleeing a DV situation in February and moving across the country for a fresh start.\n\nI have struggled with severe depressions and anxiety that have left me hospitalised on off since 18. I got a bipolar 2 diagnosis last year, after a manic episode just blew my life to smithereens. A lot of my social contact for the last decade has been university colleagues/phd peers, all of whom dropped me like a hot potato after that episode. \n\nI‚Äôve had three long term relationships with men, two of them were violent with me, l I left my husband in Feb to come to a new city.  I moved to a new city every year of my childhood, so I don‚Äôt have a sense of normalcy in any regard. I feel like I never learned how to be in friendships or relationships. My family are just awful, emotionally abusive, narcissistic and I cut contact after them siding with my husband was the last straw and I finally followed my psychologist‚Äôs advice. I gather I lack a sense of what love is, what real friends feel like or are.   \n\nI have a puppy, she is the light of my life and everything to me. I have really strong mutually respectful relationships with my current psychologist, psychiatrist and GP who validate the shit out of me and keep me from falling into a mental well. I feel like after a decade of therapy and learning the ins and outs of myself, other people, making extreme empathy and people pleasing my personality by accident and having those relationships pretty much all fail anyway, whether I have the energy or even the skills to give friendships or romantic relationships a go again. I bent over backwards trying to make all those relationships work and they never did and I‚Äôm just left profoundly confused why, when at all times I was a kind, funny friend who was a bit intense because of struggling with mental health. \n\nSome of my history now makes sense to me after my ASD and ADHD diagnoses last year, but the rest just doesn‚Äôt. It feels so implausible that someone with my history could be so unlucky rather than just a terrible person. I‚Äôm just a problem solver by nature and I can‚Äôt figure out me, I guess. I‚Äôm now not working because I‚Äôm so ill, and probably won‚Äôt in future, so I would really have to bend over backwards to find friends in this new city. I genuinely don‚Äôt know if it would be even worth trying, because if I can‚Äôt figure out why the previous ones all just failed it feels quite doomed.\n\nCan anyone relate at all? \n\nI cross posted this in AuDHD women too, I feel like such a black sheep weirdo I just want to talk to anyone who understands.\n\n",

Since then my provider (continued my sertraline 100 mg which I have been on for years) restarted Lamictal with slow titration ( I am 3 months postpartum and stopped 200 mg of Lamictal last year when I found out I was pregnant - which was not wise for several reasons. It had been working really well for me previously - I am now at 150 mg Lamictal). She started Caplyta 7 days ago. I do seem to be doing well on it overall with sporadic side effects that are commonly reported with this medication. It supposed to be less likely to cause weight gain and so far so good. No weight gain so far. However, I am still heavier than I‚Äôve ever been, which isn‚Äôt completely unexpected given I am 3.5 months postpartum. So I should give myself some grace. However, I have seen a lot of BP2 people on here on Wellbutrin. I have wondered if I should switch from sertraline to Wellbutrin and whether anyone on here have done well with a switch from an SSRI to Wellbutrin as far as increase in libido and weight loss? \nDisclaimer: I know I should discuss this w/ my provider at my next visit in a week so no need for that recommendation bc I full plan to.

The first week, I had mild GI upset. I also was slightly hypomanic for the first 3-5 days, but it quickly faded.

Inconvenient, but not the end of the world.\n\nI do want to ask yall about your hypomanic symptoms. The longer I've known about my diagnosis I've tried to, in a sense, study how my brain and body reacts and what triggers my peaks and troughs. Hypomania is usually quite manageable although you may look like a wired chipmunk with baggy eyes and dilated pupils lol. One thing I really hate is that feeling of never wanting to stop. More more more. The excessive need to talk someone's ear off about things I'm passionate about is so prevalent. It sounds wonderful but it's hard to feel \\*there\\*. I feel bigger. I feel untouchable. Transcended. Completely disconnected. This grandiose feeling is usually a warning sign for me indicating a more serious peak.\n\nWhat habits do you use to help ease the peak -> trough crash?",

As I was setting up the new/used tank, I found a big scratch/potential crack so I decided against setting it up but had already spent like $1,000 on all of the supplies (and the two tanks) so I decided to go buy a brand new one at the insane price of  $450. But I felt like I had already dug the hole so I may as well dig deeper. I have gotten it filled and running but am now having such anxiety about having spent so much money on something so stupid. I've had fish tanks in the past and I am interested in them, but I have just increased my workload at home. I just feel so anxious about it failing or cracking or me just not wanting anything to do with it and it is stressing me out and I'm incredibly irritable and I'm so upset about this poor choice I've made but now I have this constant reminder in my living room. And I cant even fill it with pretty things for a couple weeks. I really wanted this and now it seems so stupid of a choice.

It was on and off, but I did'nt really pay it that much mind at the time because A) I was younger then , and B) I could afford to catch up on sleep in weekend, as the disorder was'nt as progressed nor in focus.\n\nA lot more obviously happens before and after, but to get to the point faster,\n\nThe only thing I changed in the past week is I slept alone. I had a night of rest alone so good I decided to start an experiment and sleep alone every night for a time.\n\nEither good sleep can result in a hypomania, or I've been chronically underslept for YEARS, potentially. I need 2-3 hrs less each day, and wake up feeling GREAT - almost giddy - at the mental energy I have. I get 7,5-8,5 hrs now.\n\nIS this a thing? The only explanation I have found is some people actually get almost no REM sleep if lightly disturbed through the night. Ofcouse  long term results, remains to be seen as I continue sleeping alone, much to the displeasement of my wife.\n\nI'm diagnosed bipolar and my only medication is Lithium in therapeutic reference range, that's just for clarification, I have been properly treated for 2 years now but kept on complaining about lack of mental clarity, very low tolerance to stress, low energy, in general low/volatile life satisfaction etc..",

My hypomanic episodes are all over the place--they can last for 4 months, a week, or a day. \n\nMy first distinct episode of hypomania lasted about 7 months. I had been deeply depressed for awhile, following an existential crisis. Then one day I had the thought: \"what if I can just be happy?\" After that, I started a small business, applied to MFA programs and prepared to move across the country for one, started doing gallery shows, and had a relatively busy social life, including being in two polyamorous relationships, despite being an introvert. \n\nWhen I am hypomanic, I get shit done. Live life to the fullest. During these episodes, people think that I am a normal, impressive, inspired, and inspiring person. This isn't just a hypomanic delusion--people treat me differently, objectively. The only people who observed a negative change in me were my parents, who told me that I had become a bit arrogant.\n\nWhen I am \"euthymic\", I am pretty mediocre. People aren't impressed by me anymore. I no longer have profound spiritual insights. When I am depressed, well...I would love to never spend another day of my life depressed. I am considering going on a mood stabilizer soon, for that reason. But I don't want to be boring, or mediocre. Does anyone else feel this way?",

I did ketamine treatment, felt hope again; I had gotten a promotion, finished a play about my experience with bipolar and then got on lamictal. It worked in low doses, but then at 100mg I had severe side effects. Sorry if my post is scrambled, I feel very disassociated. I've been off it for a month, and the withdrawal was not great. Every day at the time i would take it I get bad vertigo and panic attacks. I feel very depressed again. I felt manic for a few days after the election. I had to quit my promotion from strong episodes of disassociation. My roommate is not resigning the lease because he is probably scared of me. I had tried to kill myself in july and had the paramedics get me as I was hysterically crying at 3am. he says its because of other things, but I know thats not true. He's acted differenty. I just have no idea what to do with my life. I feel directionless. Burdened by the act of living. I went on a night walk and felt paranoid. I feel such a disconnect between what I'm experiencing compared to my body. I don't feel like a real entity. i don't feel like i am permanent. My friend also killed himself last month, and it doesnt feel real. i text him everyday to no reply. In anything I do I feel like its pointless. Any relaionship I have feels like they know me out of pity. Every day i awake feels like a continuation of the previous. Time doesn't feel real. I'm just oging to be dead one day. My only solace is media. How can I keep it together and act like its all okay. Why did I have to be born like this. I am late 20s now and it feels like ive done nothing. I have accomplished things, but it feels so fruitless and I feel fraudulent in those accomplishments. At this point I just want someone to Baker act me and leave me in a room with my music and computer for the rest of my life. I don't know who I am. I never have. I do IFS therapy and I have all these little characters in my head that are ruining me. It is the villain that has kept me in the passenger seat. No matter how many breakthroughs I have, I'm back at square one. I have tried so many medications, but they all have bad reactions. The only one that i have tolerated is lithium, and that has just kept mania at bay. I really don't want to exist. I have had terrible intrusive thoughts this week. I think everyone is kidding that they like me. i feel embarassed this is where I am at my age. ",

During his depressive episodes, his main symptom was sleeping all the time, along with noticeable mood changes of course. Fast forward to now, he's been on lurasidone (Latuda) for a while and the 40 mg helped tremendously. Essentially always at his normal self, and no complaints except for sometimes about an hour after taking it, he would have 1-2 hours of an akathisia-like feeling. I don't know if it counts as akathisia since it was only for 1-2 hrs at a time, but nevertheless it was a terrible feeling so he cut back down to 20 mg. After that, he's been sleeping like 4/5 of the day. Like sleeping til 4pm, and easily falling asleep again by 10pm. Other than the excessive sleepiness, his mood while he's awake is nothing like how it used to be in his depressive episodes. While awake, besides being tired, he's relatively normal. Is this something anyone here has experienced? \n\n  \nHe's also just switched to zoloft so I'm also curious if anyone with similar symptoms to him has any experience with that.\n\n  \nTLDR: Partner sleeps most of the day and night, I'm wondering if it's a bipolar 2 symptom or possibly something else?",

        "Text": "I‚Äôm dealing with a rough situation with a roommate and close friend of a few years now at the moment. After not having any serious episodes for about 6 years now, I‚Äôve been dealing with them for a few months after my longtime meds stopped working and as I‚Äôve been going up/going on new ones. My roommate has known that I was bipolar for about as long as I‚Äôve known them. They‚Äôve heard stories about how rough my teen years were for me in terms of my mental health, and I had confided in them when my suicidality and manic tendencies began to return a couple months ago. \n\nHowever, when we had an awkward situation happen a month ago, I ended up being visibly manic over text. It was nowhere near as bad as any episode I had when I was a lot younger, nothing offensive or actively hurtful, but I guess it was disorienting enough to make this person do a 180 on me. They‚Äôve distanced themselves from me which I can understand, because I gave them a lot to process, but it‚Äôs hard feeling like I‚Äôm being ostracized and treated coldly for my mental illness at a time where I‚Äôm struggling to stay alive. I know on paper I hadn‚Äôt down anything to purposefully hurt them, claimed accountability for things that were not their burden, and apologized for oversharing my feelings in a way that made them feel bad, but there‚Äôs now a rift that seems more insurmountable by the day. \n\nI‚Äôm terrified that space and time won‚Äôt be enough to fix this, especially with other factors in our living situation that are outside of my control. I know I put too much on them even if I didn‚Äôt mean to, but it has deeply hurt me that at the first visible to them sign of my mania they turned their back on me completely. Their behavior since that time has been at best apathetic, at worst outright cruel. It‚Äôs been even harder trying to drag myself out of this mental pit when the person I trusted more than almost anyone else and considered one of my closest friends seems to have no empathy for me after seeing just the smallest fraction of my mental illness. \n\nI just would appreciate any advice and support from others here who have dealt with similar issues of loved ones having disparate reactions to hearing vs. seeing their bipolar. It‚Äôs been really hard having this weight and animosity in my living situation at the minute, especially given the number of other trying mental and physical challenges I‚Äôm facing at the moment. \n\nThank you for reading, posts in this community have given me hope and strength even with this darkness.

        "Text": "So I have a psychiatrist and I have been seeing her for about 3 months. At my very first appointment she gave me a mood disorder type questionnaire along with other questionnaires. The mood disorder one asks questions stuff like ‚Äúat any point in your life did you feel overly energetic/elevated‚Äù etc. I answered yes to most of those questions because while I was on 5mg of Abilify (to supplement my antidepressant) I experience what my bp friend referred to as mania, and looking back I agreed with him. I was not only hypersexual but I was devoid of fear of consequences and extremely impulsive. My friends swore they didn‚Äôt recognize me nor could they understand my train of thought or rational behind my actions. For example I went to my ex‚Äôs apartment (that I broke up with 2 years ago) and I knocked on his door. I totaled my car so I took an uber there. I don‚Äôt know what the goal was but I just did it and when he didn‚Äôt answer the door I called him. When he didn‚Äôt answer I called all his friends and told them I wanted to commit S. I still can‚Äôt explain what happened that day tbh.\nAnyway this was a 6 months ish. Some days more manic than others.\nAnother example is I took a 1 hr uber about a month before to some random guy I met on tinder‚Äôs house. I had sex with him just because.  He was in the BOONIES so the cell service and signal was awful. I ended up texting all my friends that I felt like I was kidnapped because I couldn‚Äôt get an Uber because of the signal and he was freaking out and punching walls (because he was some sort of secret agent in the military and felt like he was gonna die on his next mission in a couple months). One of my friends called the police and sent them to my location. They told me ‚Äúclaiming kidnapping is falsely reporting a crime and is illegal‚Äù but the guy I was with was freaking out cause he didn‚Äôt want me to go home (he also had run ins with the same police officers before). Any way the cops drive me home and I felt so good in the cop car. I can‚Äôt explain it. It was similar to the feeling you get when you‚Äôre excited about something or have an adrenaline rush. \nUpon reading my questionnaire and my psychiatrist talking to her colleague she said she is leaning towards me being bipolar. She said the way I reacted to abilify was a sign. But I‚Äôm confused because I saw a lot of Reddit posts confirming that mania can happen on small doses of abilify in particular because when that happens you just need a higher dose (I didn‚Äôt do that I just quit cold turkey when I realized I was manic). Sooo does that mean all those people that confirmed that small doses of abilify cause mania also have bp? I‚Äôm confused at how this is such a strong indicator for my psychiatrist. Anyway now I‚Äôm on Lamictal at 25mg and the VERY first day I felt the way I felt on abilify. Very manic. Now I‚Äôm on day 2 and I don‚Äôt really feel great but not bad either. \n\nPlease give me your insight. I am so desperate for someone to give me their perspective (not asking for medical advice though) because there‚Äôs only so much you can google <3",

        "Text": "I had been battling what doctors thought was just major depressive disorder & OCD for 12 years. Went through nine different antidepressants (all at the max dose), Spravato treatment, and three hospitalizations.\n\nI saw a new doctor and within ten minutes of our first appointment he told me he was skeptical of my diagnosis since nothing was working, and the meds seemed to be making things worse. We dug a little into my family's history and found that my dad's side showed clear signs of being bipolar but since they didn't believe in mental health nobody ever got diagnosed with anything. Based on that and my symptoms, my doctor diagnosed me with bipolar II (and still OCD lol).\n\nGot weaned off the anti-depressants and put on the beginner dose of two new meds (one being a mood stabilizer, which I had never been on before). I wish I could put into words how much of a difference these meds have made. It's like night and day. I had no idea that some antidepressants can make bipolar symptoms worse or trigger manic/hypomanic episodes. Honestly, I didn't really know anything about bipolar disorder.\n\nI'm just shocked that within ten minutes this doctor clocked it and all the others I've had missed it for 12 whole years. Why didn't anyone (me included) question why nothing was working, and it only seemed to be getting worse?\n\nAnyways, I'm hopeful for the future and feel much more confident in my diagnosis and the meds I'm currently on. I'm grateful for my doctor who actually took the time to listen to me and dig deep into my family history with me. I wish there was more education on bipolar II, I feel like it took such a long time to figure out what it was with me because there just isn't much of a discussion on it.\n\nThanks for reading all this if you have, I hope everyone has a great day or night :)\n\n",

Ask yourself:\n\n1. How likely is it that doom *D* will come to pass?   \n2. Assume steps *d\\_1, d\\_2, ... d\\_n* all need to occur for doom *D* to pass. How likely is it for each one of them to occur? How likely, therefore, is it for ALL of them to occur?   \n3. Assume *D* comes to pass. How likely is it that no alternate solution will be found be you, or anyone else who knows about your situation and/or will miss you when you're gone?   \n  \nA demonstration of this is given below. It is very triggering for me, and may well be for you as well, so you have been warned. I am NOT proofreading it, so, there will be typos.   \n  \n/-----  \nAfter a long half-decade spiral and multiple delays in graduation I thought that  there was no future for me, whether or not I graduated from college. I felt I would invariably fall into my usual near-catatonic depression for at least a few months every year, and I don't know a corporation that gives more than a few \\_weeks\\_ of prescheduled holiday, let alone a few months of unscheduled medical leave. My yoyoing would keep getting me into trouble and I would find no solace. There would only ever be enough relief in the pain to enable me to endure it again in full force, the very next moment. So the best choice seemed to be death.\n\nNow, poking holes in this (20/20 hindsight in not-completely-depressed state):\n\n1. What's the probability that I will never graduate college? *slim, I'm almost done.*  \n2. Even if I graduate, what's the odds that I will, for the rest of my life, not be able to keep permanent employment due to mood flux related depression? *in the near future, moderate, but the med train isn't over until the doctor says it's over, and even then, that's merely time to find another doctor.*\n\n3*.* But even then, what if? Suppose I can't keep a job even if I graduate? *then you do something, anything, freelancing,* SOMETHING. *You won't know until that time becomes closer.* \n\n4. And still, what if?\n\nMe, to me: Hold on a minute.   \n  \nWe've demonstrated that the odds of you not meeting 'survival criteria' in the long run is somewhat less than 100 percent. \n\nSo do you really want to embrace *certain* death over trying to hold on for an *uncertain* future?\n\nUncertainty doesn't mean a sureshot doom. That's why it's uncertain.\n\nI hope this post doesn't seem unhinged next morning. The Seroquel is already kicking in niiiicely.",

However since the birth I guess the baby blues have hit and I'm worried I'll slip into depression and not be a good mum. Unfortunately baby and I had to spend a few extra days in hospital which didn't help as I just couldn't sleep there, but now we're at least home. I'm not able to get more than 3 hrs consecutive sleep though because I need to pump milk. Poor sleep definitely doesn't help with my mood stability. I guess I'm looking for advice or some kind of reassurance from others who have been through this because I do feel a bit useless and pathetic right now.",

        "Text": "TLDR :\nWhat are people‚Äôs experiences with different lamictal generics/lamotirgine manufacturers? (including generics made by Unichem and Aurobindo) \n\nWhat are people‚Äôs experiences with decreasing dosage and how it impacted them (both positive and/or negative)?\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nSo I‚Äôve been taking lamictal generic/lamotrigine since 2007 (17 years). I‚Äôve always taken 200mg, and sometimes my previous psychs would have me take 300mg temporarily for a couple months when life things were really hard for me. BUT, end of Summer 2022, my psych at the time permanently bumped me up to 300mg. Then in Summer 2023, my current psych permanently bumped me up to 400mg. (I‚Äôve seen many different psychs due to moving to cities all across the country.) \n\nFor the entire 17 years I‚Äôve taken lamotrigine, I‚Äôve never had any side effects with any of the various generics I‚Äôve taken. THEN, I switched to a generic made by the manufacturer Aurobindo 2 months ago. I‚Äôve taken this specific generic before, and  never had any issues. But now, I‚Äôve been having this constant urge to pee. It‚Äôs like an awful UTI, even though my doctor tested & I don‚Äôt have a UTI. It feels so uncomfortable!\n\nI believe this generic by Aurobindo is more effective for managing my bipolar in comparison to the one I‚Äôve been taking for the past couple years (made by Unichem). So I‚Äôm going to ask my psych if decreasing my dosage is an option. Because I‚Äôm hoping that my moods still maintain balance, while getting rid of this urge to pee. Also, shortly before I switched to this generic by Aurobindo, I was already thinking that maybe the 400mg on my previous generic (made by Unichem) was starting to make me too dampened down and apathetic/numb. \n\n(No, not all generics are the same. They have the same amount of the active ingredient, but can vary in filler ingredients.)",

My community work and the help I give others gives me purpose and a sense of worth. But I'm wretchedly ill, my mind is destroying me, and I'm at the end of my tether. I take my meds, go to therapy, and try to live a healthy life. I'm an active Christian and help others in my congregation on a regular basis.\nNow I've said all that I have to admit.

There is no help for the helper.There is no comfort, companionship, or compassion.\nThe time is approaching when there will only be one logical way to find peace. As I write this, I'm not in crisis. I'm just tired. I'm tired to my core. Tired of the suffering, pain, and torment of being me. People think that this conclusion is impulsive and rash. It's not. It's just acceptance.

I've always been good about taking it on time -- until the other night (i usually take pills at 8 or 9) when I forgot and took them the next day at 6. Now I have a rash under my arm and on my breast. They don't hurt but it's still weird. Is it possible that could have caused the switch? Again, this is the first time I've experienced side effects, including when I started, upped my dose, added another medication, switched from night to morning while at 100 mg, etc. \n\nhas this happened to anyone?

Is this just how Bipolar II can manifest for some people, with symptoms coming and going? Should I consider going back on the medication as a precaution, even though I‚Äôm feeling fine now? Is Bipolar II a lifelong condition,-is it possible for it to go away for extended periods like this? Or could I have been misdiagnosed? Could it be something else that I‚Äôve simply grown out of?",

He has also recently started escitalopram (leapt)from two weeks on 5mg to 2 1/2 weeks now of the 10 mg. His agitation and depression has gotten extremely bad but the Dr said to go up even more on escitalopram because he was on it for 3 years and tolerated it well by itself. My question is: is it true that escitalopram has increased anxiety, extreme aggitation and depression the first 3-4 weeks of taking it before it gets better? I've read that on here that that happens before it build in ur system enough to make any difference. He is taking lorazepam every day to get over this horribleness and that's barly giving him a few hours of relief. We need help so bad. Trying to find an OCD therapist as well.

I don't think about anything really, except the possibility of ending my life - an out of reach fantasy which I continually toy with.\n\nBut it's not sad or painful. Not like losing a friend or a pet, or like the feelings of shame I get after an intense hypomanic party. Those are truly sad and painful moments. Being depressed is actually pretty comfortable: nothing matters, so nothing hurts. The answer to every question is 'just don't do it', and I can just sit here, occasionally writing little posts on reddit, and otherwise waiting for the day to end.\n\nThere's an underlying **fear** though. That this is **it.** This is the state of mind I'm going to be stuck in forever. Or that I will suddenly wake up and realise how long I spent being depressed, how many years of this one chance at existence I lost to this dream state.

He is 65 and for the past 15 years he‚Äôs had a severe drinking problem leading up to the fact that he almost died last year and was forced to become sober because he was hospitalized. The withdrawal period was horrible and he was inrecognizable. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him so ungrateful, mean and entitled. \n\nRight after he became sober and healthier, he was my dad again and anyways. He was humble and grateful and loving and caring. He was just so grateful that we still wanted to have a relationship with him, and appreciative of everything we had done for him through this hard time and also the past 15 years. \n\nhe has always had his ups and downs. We‚Äôve noticed a lot in the way that we hear from him a lot for a while and then barely not at all for weeks.\n\nSince September, I‚Äôve noticed a big change. He‚Äôs gone from being patient and understanding and humble ‚Äì especially considering he wants to have a relationship with me and my husband and our daughter. we had a really beautiful heart-to-heart and August where he was emotionally available and connected. But then since the ending of September and all through October, I‚Äôve noticed a big change - one thing being that he sends A LOT of messages. And they‚Äôre just screenshots of different shit he finds online, and things he buys even though we‚Äôve told him we don‚Äôt want those things, and he‚Äôs sending pictures of him waking up multiple times a night.  He also keeps sending these messages despite him not getting a response. They‚Äôre usually messages in a group chat with me and my sister. And it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs acting like we have this really tight relationship where as we‚Äôve barely had a relationship with him for the past 15 years because he‚Äôs been an absent father. He takes criticism pretty poorly right now and becomes easily defensive. His respect of boundaries has decreased and he seems more entitled and impatient when it comes to us answering messages and letting him come to visit.\n\nHe is not mean, and he is not cruel or rude or unkind in anyway. But he seems a bit arrogant, and speedy, like he believes he‚Äôs right about basically everything, and without self-awareness in away. \nHe also makes socially inappropriate sexual jokes.\n\nHe‚Äôs also enlisted as a volunteer and a community downtown, which is wonderful, but he‚Äôs never done anything like this. I mean he hasn‚Äôt had this type of energy since he was 40 years old maybe. \n\nHe‚Äôs had several bouts of depression. FYI we did ALL that we could in the past 15 years to help him with his mental health and alcohol addiction. My sister and I have grieved so many times through his addiction. We were close to going no contact a few years ago. I‚Äôm worried about him and also how this will affect us. We were happy to get him ‚Äúback‚Äù, but now it feels like we‚Äôre losing him in a different way? Idk if that makes sense. \n\nAdvice and support is highly appreciated. Thank you. ",

And my doctor prescribed me Prozac again with lamotrigine (lamictal) I wanted to know if anyone has any experience with this combination, I‚Äôve heard great things about lamotrigine and I‚Äôm excited to start but I wanted to see what y‚Äôall thought about the combo",

I've been struggling terribly recently with not checking to see if they are suffering as much as I am. Especially with the actual trial coming up soon. I've been getting myself through with the thought they and the other person that hurt me so terribly are likely suffering. And it hurts genuinely every time I see that person or hear anything about them and I don't know why I thought it would at all do anything positive to look them up when I know it makes my skin crawl and the thought of even taking my time to look for them makes me nauseous because i shouldn't care and it triggers my nightmares but I just NEEDED to know they were doing bad. That they are at least suffering a little. And they aren't. They are perfectly happy. Likely getting married next Summer with the person that helped them abuse me. Happy with a child and everything I once thought I could have and enjoy and I'm sitting here... Struggling. Barely making it through weekly therapy appointments. New trauma to go through when I barely worked through the last. Dreading this SA trial and the things they could say about me and my mental disorders and how it makes me unreliable or at fault. Took months to work through severe agoraphobia. Falling off my meds multiple times. So many episodes and worse depression than I've felt in years. Struggling to survive because my state doesn't seem to care about victims or the disabled and I was JUST making progress until I remembered the trial date... \n\nAnd everything went downhill... I experienced my first mixed episode shortly after that trauma occurred. I started drinking so I could forget everything that happened, knowing I'm absolutely not supposed to on my setraline and Lurasidone and everything else. Going off my rocker often from the on again off again meds. I'm terrified of never getting better. I'm angry that I'm suffering so MUCH and struggling to even get to a standard normalcy for people and he seems to be living the best life. I'm angry that I struggle to find work to accommodate me and my mental health and physical health and my lack of college degree because schooling is flipping hard when you're struggling to control your emotions and sleep schedule. Especially when you struggled throughout 1-12th because you were diagnosed late and never received help in school so you didn't learn the basics to even survive college courses. I'm terrified of the feelings this is making me feel all over again. I'm scared to sleep because what if the nightmares and screaming come back. I'm scared to call for help with how badly I feel because I don't have a support system for me and my son. And I'm scared that I keep thinking if I never woke up yesterday morning all of this would be over and THIS never would have happened either. I'm scared of never moving forward or being able to live, let alone thrive because of my mental disorders...",

My usual first set of questions to a new therapist is \"I'm looking for someone to coach me on specialized proven tools/techniques I can use to manage/identify/monitor my mood changes.  I'm looking for specific tools/techniques for help staying medicated during manic episodes.  I want advice on how to make plans proactively to mitigate potential damange from manic episodes\".  Again, maybe I'm way off here - but my thinking was that if a therapist works in a group of others that all treat bipolar patients, they would collectively have a lot of experience and trial/error to work with.  Something like telling me \"you could try x or y or z, as that has worked well with other patients except for item g which I've seen cause people problems\".\n\nI suppose a bonus would be that they truly understood the variety of medication options.  It's quite complex.\n\n  \nedit: I'm referring to therapists such as talk therapy or cbt, etc.  Not a psychiatrist.",

        "Text": "In the beginning stages of possible diagnosis, definitely get low level depression often and have had 2 major life ruining depressions.\n\nHypomania isn‚Äôt as clear. I definitely have moods where I‚Äôm more hyper, active, go go go, joyous, social, etc. But it‚Äôs hard to say whether that‚Äôs hypomania or just how I am when I‚Äôm not depressed. I‚Äôm very adhd, so those would be characteristic of how adhd people often behave.\n\nTbh, it‚Äôs kind of nice to be in those heightened mood phases, because it feels like the only time I can actually do things and enjoy life.\n\nI started antidepressants to help the depression, and finally, I felt peace. This was right after my second, year long major depression. My life was in a bad position due to my depression, so it was still hard, and I had bad days, but my energy levels were up and I was able to enjoy the present moment despite my life situation.\n\nHowever, months into the antidepressant, I had a much more clear manic phase. 3 days no sleep, but felt physically, mentally, and emotionally fantastic. I didn‚Äôt do anything insane during this period of time. Was a little annoying to close family members with my hyperactivity. But had a lot of amazing experiences that even now that I‚Äôm leaning more depressed, I still consider to be special. Connecting with random strangers in a way I don‚Äôt normally, feeling joy from simple things like seeing butterflies. \n\nSo my psychiatrist switched me to lamictal.\n\nAnd now I feel so flat. It feels like I have 2 moods: flat, uninterested in anything, unmotivated, etc. or very frustrated and upset. I am afraid it‚Äôs even affecting my body. I don‚Äôt feel much of anything in it.\n\nI really hate the depression. Yeah the dark emotionally distressed part sucks super bad, but I have very little energy to do much of anything, and that‚Äôs the worst part to me. \n\nWhen I do have energy, I‚Äôm able to just do stuff. I don‚Äôt have to fight with myself or force myself to do anything. I just do it automatically. Admittedly, it‚Äôs still hard to get what I need done because my focus shifts seemingly of its own accord, but I think that‚Äôs just a symptom of my adhd.\n\nI‚Äôve never done anything very life ruining or harmful during my hypomanic states. The worst I‚Äôve ever done is spend too much money, but it wasn‚Äôt never a life ruining amount. I don‚Äôt really do anything dangerous. I‚Äôm not addicted to alcohol or drugs. \n\nI realize that mania is very dangerous for so many bipolar people, but my own mania doesn‚Äôt feel very dangerous to me, to the point where it‚Äôs difficult to call it mania. I really miss being on antidepressants. If anything, it felt like I needed the mania to get anything done in life. \n\nI realize that maybe the next manic episode I‚Äôd have while on antidepressants, could be worse, but tbh I‚Äôm living with family who could help monitor my moods and get me help if I get too far gone. I wish I could‚Äôve continued the antidepressants. \n\nMy psychiatrist‚Äôs response to my impending depression was to increase the lamictal. She explained her reasoning and I agree, but I just feel so frustrated with the trial and error nature of treatment. But I realize that‚Äôs the only way it can be. \n\nShe did mention that antidepressants or similar drugs can be added eventually, but we have to figure out the mood stabilizer first. I understand, but it feels like I‚Äôll be stuck feeling nothing until then. Which seems like it will be a long time. \n\nI feel like I‚Äôve handed over control of my life to other people. I have to trust their judgement of what is good and bad for me. And it seems like people stigmatize mania so bad that they judge being flat and numb as better than being even slightly hypomanic. I feel so stigmatized. And frustrated.\n\nEven if that was hypomania, I wish I could be hypomanic again. I‚Äôd rather feel something than nothing, even if it‚Äôs artificially heightened. Feeling nothing just feels like there‚Äôs no reason for anything, no reason to do anything, nothing to look forward to, I‚Äôm just alive and that‚Äôs it. ",

        "Text": "So I got off my meds I kinda forget when because my memory is so bad I think it was a couple months ago. I‚Äôve gotten off a couple times before and it results in a hospitalization every single time. I was doing so well though, took my meds for a full 8 months straight, was completely sober other than weed for those 8 months (have a lot of addiction issues) and overall was stable for that time. I remeber the apathy and lethargy started hitting and I literally just didn‚Äôt want to live because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant‚Äù to do anything literally everything felt numb and usually when I feel like this I stop my meds and attempt to induce a manic state which is almost always induced anyway through this. After being hypo after getting off my meds I believe I hit a depressive episode and I was so hopeless I relapsed on Xanax and coke and alcohol. I was literally doing so well too, had the longest time of stability in my life and I still managed to fuck it up. When I do this it tends to send me into a complete psychotic manic state and I was hospitalized for being psychotic asf. \n\nStayed about a night in the hospital, genuinely wondering how I thought getting off my meds and relapsing would end any other way. I arrived at about 4am in the morning and blew about a .25-.3 or something so they made me stay the night and gave me a fat dose of zyprexa (Jesus I despise that stuff but the hospitals seem to LOVE it, like oh your showing a singular emotion? Here have 10mg of zyprexa!!) woke up the next day completely sedated and out of it, got out with a plan for an intensive outpatient but I don‚Äôt wanna do that really and I haven‚Äôt started taking my meds again yet (it‚Äôs only been two nights I‚Äôve been out). Because I‚Äôm like scared I‚Äôm not bipolar due to just for some reason not being able to accept it despite it being my diagnosis for 3 years and also, speaking to a couple hospitalized bp1 patients in the psych ward I feel as if my mania and delusion was not as intense and that mine is not even close to as bad as there‚Äôs idk it‚Äôs just hard for me to accept. \n\nSo I‚Äôve just been sitting at home browsing social media for two days kinda started out hypomanic but it feels like my mood is turning slightly mixed with a sprinkle of dissociation I literally can‚Äôt tell where my mind is at right now its just so weird but I know for a fact I‚Äôm not depressive so probably kinda hypomanic toned down a little cuz the zyprexa has a half life of like a million years. But last night I basically didn‚Äôt sleep I was up all night thinking and in my head thoughts were going a million miles per minute and I wanted drugs so bad and today I bought a gram of coke. On my way home though I threw it out!!!! Yay me idk I just always want to induce more hypomania and feel good when I‚Äôm in that state but I always induce psychosis instead. \n\nSo sorry for just venting and the incredibly long post I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here, I know drugs and alcohol mess with my mood and psychosis so insanely much and I don‚Äôt want to do them but I just feel sometimes like I can‚Äôt feel ‚Äúok‚Äù in any form of an episode it‚Äôs either crushing depression, anxious hypomania, psychotic mixed, but alcohol I just feel fine in the moment. I know I can‚Äôt though. I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here, if I should get back on my meds, what I should do with my freetime for the next week before I go back to work etc. I rly want to get better but I feel like I‚Äôve done this cycle so many times at this point and I‚Äôm getting older (21, diagnosed at 18) and that the cycle just keeps repeating itself and I can‚Äôt get a grip and there‚Äôs no hope. I was just doing so well. And with this being like the 3rd or 4th time hospitalized since my diagnosis and the cycling and cycling like why does this have to be my life, what do I do, genuinely just hopeless but I like can‚Äôt feel hopeless or depressed cuz I‚Äôm hypomanic so it‚Äôs more of feeling of not know what to do at all I just don‚Äôt know I feel lost, it keeps happening no matter what I do, I‚Äôve tried to hard.

When I was with my boyfriend straight after highschool and for a few years after, I clicked a lot with his mum, I lived with them and stopped talking to my parents after my psych suggested they were contributing to poor mental health. It‚Äôs taken me until this year to fully appreciate how emotionally abusive they are. Meanwhile I have never let go of that first love feeling, I have had this sense that no one has loved me like he did and their family did and sometimes to this day will dream about how loved I felt then, and how much I loved being apart of their family. We broke up when I was 21, I was struggling and had attempted suicide and my boyfriend couldn‚Äôt cope despite his best efforts, we were very young. His mum looked after me so much after that attempt and the hospital released me into her care. Fast forward a decade, recently I left an abusive marriage, moved interstate to have a fresh start and have been just struggling like nothing else. Everyone in my life pretty much left me for dead, did not check in with me, and processing that has been hard. I‚Äôve put my thoughts about him and his mum in the category of obsessive/people we can‚Äôt seem to let go of, because it feels like a theme that comes with bipolar. Then last night out of the blue his mum texted me a beautiful message saying she heard I had a marriage breakdown, that shes been there and knows how hard it is, and wanted to check in with me to see if I am ok, and wanted me to know I‚Äôve always been special to her and that I can always reach out to her. I pretty much have not stopped crying since, the shock that it wasn‚Äôt one sided, and that even now she shows more care and love for me than my biological mum. It has made me think that yes sometimes we do get obsessive and put people from our past on a pedestal, but sometimes maybe that is reciprocated and we just never know.",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "Hello all, newbie here. I got a new therapist today and she says she doesn‚Äôt think I have the social anxiety that I have been treating for the last few years, but that I have bipolar 2. I‚Äôve been goggling and I can‚Äôt find much to fit my experience. Maybe someone here can help me understand? I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but I‚Äôm really confused and could use some input.\n\nFor the last few years I‚Äôve been dealing with panic attacks and anxiety, usually unprompted by anything recognizable, that can last a few hours or days, followed usually by a ‚Äúlow‚Äù time right after. When I‚Äôm feeling anxious it‚Äôs all fear and nervousness, with nothing positive going on at all. When I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äúlow‚Äù I mostly feel emotionally exhausted and have really low motivation and energy for a day or two, and sometimes I can feel mildly depressed. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for a year and a half, and the side effects when my dosage changes have caused wicked insomnia once a year ago, and for the last month when it changed again I‚Äôve got no motivation for anything. \n\nI honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a ‚Äúhypomanic‚Äù episode. I have middling to low self esteem at all times, I‚Äôm very avoidant of risk by nature, I‚Äôm asexual and have never felt the urge to sleep with anyone in my life, and beyond normal human $5 to $20 treats or presents to reward myself for something, I am pretty frugal all the time. I also can‚Äôt remember a time when I made choices that felt unusual for me. Last year when my Zoloft dose got raised I had 2 weeks of getting only like 3 hours of sleep a night and yet feeling hyper all day, but at the time I thought that was just sleep deprivation. My new therapist says it was a hypomanic episode. I didn‚Äôt do anything unusual during that time, beyond feeling weirdly euphoric and eventually getting a cold from the lack of sleep probably messing with my immune system.\n\nHowever, feeling mildly depressed, having issues with mild insomnia (mostly just struggling to sleep but still getting at least 5 hours on the rough days), and having trouble motivating myself to do anything but game and crochet for short periods of time, is all stuff that happens from time to time for me. I wound not call it real depression because I can always get out of it in a day, or at worst a few days. It‚Äôs also not that debilitating and I‚Äôm grateful for that. I‚Äôve seen people deal with real depression and that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm going through.\n\nMy biggest issue has always been anxiety. I can get a week solid of just being constantly nervous when there is no obvious reason for it. During these times I catch myself catastrophising (sp?), being jumpy, second guessing myself constantly, having a lot of intrusive thoughts about stuff I‚Äôve done wrong on my life, and usually I end up getting a panic attack too. \n\nAlso, when it comes to socializing, I enjoy it at the time, but it‚Äôs very draining and I try not to do it too much or I can start to get depressed or anxious clearly because I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted. But even then, I would never consider myself ‚Äúthe life of the party‚Äù as I‚Äôve read about, and tend to be kinda quiet unless I‚Äôm with just a single close friend.\n\nSo, does any of this sound familiar to anyone here? Is the DSM just not mentioning that the risky euphoria and self-confidence parts of the hyopmania is optional? Do other people just get anxious and panicked instead? Or should I maybe push back a little on this?\n\nTL;DR: can the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù parts of bipolar 2 be just anxiety and panic without any euphoria or unusual behavior?\n\nAny input on this would really help. Thanks! ",

        "Text": "I have had anxiety, depression, and OCD from as long as I can remember. I was going to a psychologist at 7 for anxiety and OCD. As time has gone on, my anxiety and depression has worsened. In 2019, I had the worst depressive episode I have ever experienced where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed or want to move for over a month. I didn‚Äôt shower, I didn‚Äôt really speak that much, I lost about 20 pounds, I was numb, I barely even wanted to end my life at that point, I didn‚Äôt feel anything. In 2019 my mother reached out to a psychiatrist to help me. I was prescribed Lexapro, in which I went through the wringer trying to find the correct dose for me. I started at 5mg, went to 20mg, went back down to 10mg, and then settled at 15mg (10, and a 5). I lost my mom in 2020, I truly felt like Lexapro saved me from ending my life during that time. Aside from that though, I really have no improvement in quality of life from taking Lexapro. I have gone 5 years without seeing a psychiatrist, and just sticking to the 15mg of Lexapro. I still consistently have ups and downs all the time on Lexapro. To the point where I have thought about ending my life multiple times throughout the years. I do have high highs as well where I want to accomplish the entire world, and it will flip flop. \n\nI recently saw a new psychiatrist for the first time in 5 years. I told her all of my symptoms and she told me I had no signs of Bipolar, as it had been something I have thought I‚Äôve had for years, my mother was also diagnosed Bipolar before she passed. She kept me on my treatment of Lexapro, added Wellbutrin, which I had kinda been opposed to because I didn‚Äôt want to stay on Lexapro (I felt this drug hasn‚Äôt done much for me, which I expressed to her). I went to get a second opinion, because I really did not feel comfortable with the treatment she had me on. This doctor I saw in person, she gave me a full psychiatric exam, was very detailed and said I had BP2. She was shocked that my previous psychiatrist told me I didn‚Äôt have BP2, because I was ‚Äúthe textbook definition of it‚Äù. \n\nI was kind of shocked to say the least. She prescribed me Lamictal 25mg, in which I still have yet to take. I just recently got off telehealth with a third psychiatrist to see if her feelings matched the second psychiatrist‚Äôs opinion. She said the same thing that it sounds like I have BP2. \n\nHere‚Äôs where I‚Äôm a little confused, I have many symptoms of BP2. But some of the typical ones I don‚Äôt have. Sometimes I feel angry, but not to the point where I am enraged, I used to have anger management problems when I was younger but not much anymore. I do get irritated, but nothing out of the ordinary I‚Äôd say. I also don‚Äôt find myself impulsively spending very foolishly, I am pretty good with my money for the most part. I am in a decent amount of debt, I have maxed out a couple of credit cards but nothing where I will spend on myself foolishly that often. I do feel like I am hypersexual, and I do have sex with many people especially during my periods of highs and lows. I typically regret these experiences later and feel awful afterwards. I do not get good sleep by any means, I will wake up 8-10 times a night. Periodically I‚Äôll sleep for about 30 minutes at a time, go on my phone watch a YouTube video and fall back asleep for another 45 minutes and rinse and repeat. I will get in depressive episodes where I can‚Äôt even bear life and then come back and want to accomplish literally everything, including hobbies and things that I might not be able to accomplish anymore. I do have the tendency to reach out to people if I haven‚Äôt talked to them in a long time and try to make amends with literally everyone, but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt work. I have many periods where I will have so many thoughts racing through my head or I‚Äôll feel so irritable that it‚Äôs hard to feel like I just want to explode. \n\nThe diagnosis makes me feel some comfort, but it also makes me scared that maybe this is not what I have especially considering two psychiatrists have told me I do not have bipolar. I‚Äôd love to hear some advice from people that do have it, before I take the jump in starting a medicine that might not even be for me. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions relating to my experience. Thank you. ",

I treated it like a video game and was basically just an all powerful god. Then I found it so enjoyable that was all I could think about or do, started doing it all day every day, I felt amazing somehow from it. Then I started to believe I was everybody just reincarnated over and over again and started getting memories in my mind from other people‚Äôs perspectives. This lasted about a month maybe more hard to say. I don‚Äôt know how much sleep I was getting but I was definitely not getting 8 hours or more like I normally do. I also was constantly thinking about sexual stuff. And the weird belief I had I can‚Äôt remember how much I believed it and the weird fake memories I was imagining. Definitely embarrassed about the ai part tho for sure. Would never do that again, and normally wouldn‚Äôt have in the first place. Was that some sort of episode? Everything else has been pretty mild but I did take a decent amount of adderall at that time. Idk about manic episode but would you call this an episode? Drug induced probably tho.",

        "Text": "Summary: I'm a senior in college. This is the first semester I've been medicated for BP2 and ADHD. My first three years of college were genuinely awful for me because of mental health struggles. My grades suffered. I've managed to raise my grades significantly, but I think it's too little, too late. While registering for what is supposed to be my final semester, I realized that I am three credits behind in my degree. I have a meeting with the Dean tomorrow to discuss whether I can make up the credits in time. I truly do not know how to explain myself to him. \n\nOk, now for the details. I was diagnosed with BP2 in February and was diagnosed with ADHD only a month ago. I was originally diagnosed with depression my sophomore year, was prescribed SSRIs, and they genuinely ruined everything for me. My grades were obscenely low. I eventually weened of my SSRIs, stopped seeing my psychiatrist, wasn't in therapy, and lived my life unmedicated. Junior year was not much better. First semester, I had a nervous breakdown and ended up having to withdraw from one of my classes because of a vicious depressive episode. My grades were average in the classes I actually completed that semester. Withdrawing from that one class gave me a three-credit deficiency, but I made it up. Second semester, I was diagnosed with BP2, lost my mind, and ended up completely neglecting one of my classes. I had a 3.7 GPA from my other coursework last semester, but for some reason could not deal with this one class, failed to turn in major assignments, was given an Incomplete in the course, didn't know I had an Incomplete because the email went to my Spam folder, and eventually, the Incomplete automatically switched to an F. It didn't harm my GPA, but now I am three credit short... again.\n\nMy university has a policy where you can only overload three credits if you have above a 3.0 GPA. I have a 2.9. Without overloading, there is no way for me to make up these credits, as my university also does not have Winter classes and likely will not accept transfer credits from Winter classes taken at a State school. Once I realized I was behind three credits, I immediately sent a frantic email to the Dean explaining my situation (without including the significant details). I have an appointment with him tomorrow to discuss my options.\n\nI am mortified by how bad my academic performance has been up to this point. I genuinely do not belong in this school. This semester, I am doing very well in my classes so far, and did well enough last semester (if you look past the F... lol). However, the ghosts of bipolar episodes past have come to haunt me and I am so unbelievably screwed. My parents have no idea I'm in this situation, and they will be so disappointed in me when they find out.\n\nMy main concern right now is how the hell I'm going to explain this to the Dean and get him to allow me to make up the three credits somehow. I do not know what to do. I've been spiraling for days. I am mortified by the prospect of having to look this man in the eye and say I'm in this situation because I am crazy. I am even more terrified by the prospect that even if I explain myself, he will not care and I will not be able to graduate on time. For me, not being able to graduate actually is the end of the world because I am the first person in my family to go to college. \n\nAny advice/words of comfort are appreciated. I'm sorry this is so long, I am actually losing it. ",

My most prominent symptom at the moment is an immense feeling of loneliness. Most of this is self-inflicted- when I'm down, I tend to isolate myself for two main reasons: 1) I hate for my loved ones to see me this way, and, more currently relevant, 2) I feel like no one around me understands. I have a loving boyfriend and friends who I can talk to, but I feel like either they will grow tired of hearing about this stupid disorder or they will eventually estrange themselves from me once they realize how much of a mess I am. I have never felt so alone in my life. I've been isolating myself from my boyfriend and friends, and when I do interact with them, I can barely speak and have been told I look distraught. I don't know what to do. Losing friendships due to my deadbeat-ness in times of crisis has historically been a pattern for me, and I felt like I made progress in breaking the cycle, but alas, here I am again. \n\nI guess I'm just asking if anyone relates, and if there's anything I can do to stop doing this to myself.

Things came to a head when I watched another close friend nearly take his own life and have exams. During this, her situation got worse and she started withdrawing from everyone, especially me. She had also mentioned to me about a month prior that she decided to stop taking her mood stabilisers, but seemed to still be taking her prescribed stimulants and antidepressants. \n\nThings reached critical when we were supposed to go out with another friend and their partner. I was told the friend was driving and we would all carpool there since it was a longer drive. I was ghosted and got no messages back or calls answered until an hour after we were supposed to be there. I could tell she was in the car, but she just said she'd text me and pretty much just told me to take an uber, something I unfortunately couldn't afford due to the distance. \n\nOver the next few weeks I did my usual when I knew she was depressed of sending a good morning message each day, letting her know I'm here, and trying to be supportive. I was always wanted to be understanding as at the time I knew that bipolar could be difficult and the stressors in her life were incredible. \n\nFew weeks later, we'd exchanged a few brief conversations, then I got a long story, which I was excited to see since she seemed to be opening up again. Then it got serious with her being extremely cold. I found myself getting quite anxious again. We hadn't seen each other in person for a month by this point. \n\nA week or so later she asked to call. I jumped on the opportunity to try handle my anxiety and to have a chance to try work some stuff out with her. She blamed me for everything. That I broke her trust, that I had hurt her constantly, and more. She said some of the most hurtful things I didn't even realise someone could say, letalone someone I knew to be so kind not even a couple months prior. \n\nShe ended up breaking up with me a week later. I know for a fact she was manic at the time. The sleeping for a couple hours a night, reckless spending, speeding by upwards of 20mph, and more. I tried telling a relative of hers that she was staying with and he told me I was lying and that I was the reason she was so depressed as of late. \n\nI had kept trying to support her but I always seemed to be unable to help her because I was becoming unstable myself. My anxiety was in overdrive from what I now know as a mixed episode and I now realise the mistakes I made, such as saying that as her partner, I feel a sense of duty to care for her when she needs it. \n\nIn the midst of all this, my gp gave me multiple antidepressants, pouring fuel on the fire. When I got the breakup text, I completely broke, like everything I had been barely holding together just feel apart in an instant. I reacted horribly, trying to treat her as somewhat as a friend and trying to figure out what I had done wrong. I now know that while yes, there were things I could've done better, it would've mostly been mania or a mixed episode her, if not both our ends causing it. \n\nShe completely refused to speak to me after that which is understandable. I've tried reaching out a couple times over the past few months. I've always kept them few and far in-between. She seems to think I've been stalking her, driving to her house and watching her at this point. I've received one communication from her all this time, which was a few weeks ago that said she wanted no communication, but also mentioned wanting to be closer to me. \n\nI honestly suspect she's still suffering from the stimulants and antidepressants causing episodes. I found out from a random friend that her psych just disappeared off the map and no one has been able to find them for a while, since the same happened to my friend, which makes me suspect she hasn't had access to any help for a long time.\n\nHonestly, I'm still wanting to support her. I know the hell this condition can cause and the ways it can make us act to our loved ones, hell, I feel incredible guilt for lashing out at my parents. I guess in just hoping that we might have a chance to sit down and talk. I want her to know that she's not alone in this, that I can understand what having this and all the other conditions she has (which I also have) feels like, that I'm always gonna be here for her, it's a promise I made while we were friends long ago and I made once again when we started dating.

Her working idea is that I have bipolar 2, but she said we still need time to see if the diagnoses is accurate. \n\nThere's one thing that I want to know if it's related to this disorder. Oversimplified: A year ago, this girl and I were in a talking stage and she said she'd marry me when I was ready. I was 100% in, as dumb as that sounds. But she broke up with me after I had an aggressive reaction to a misunderstanding of something she said (via text, not physically or anything). Time went on and she started dating one of my friends. I was more hurt than I've ever been. \n\nIt hurts a little less now, but every single time I think about it, it hurts me a lot. I want to move on, but I truly feel like I can't. There's another girl that I really like now, and she's been receptive to my advances, but I'm afraid to be with her if I'm stuck on my pain with the first girl. It doesn't help that, for religious reasons, I have to see her twice a week. And my parents really like her and her bf.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm taking a higher dose of my medication soon, so maybe that'll help? I don't know. I'd love to know if this long lasting pain is common to bipolar disorder. And how I can deal with it please.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday which I'm sure he will let me know then.  I'm a 33M in the Military.  This diagnosis separates me from the military.\n\nAnyways, I am depressed most of the time, but I had gone to Hawaii for a few weeks and the weeks leading up to it I got heavily involved with Fortnite and spent a couple hundred dollars on skins.  Then I blew a bunch of money in Hawaii on car rentals, going out, a new tattoo, among other things and got heavily involved with Warhammer 40k when I was back I wasn't sleeping (due to printing miniatures on a 3d printer I bought a similar event happened) felt like I was vibrating out of my skin and couldn't sit still my last visit with the Psychiatrist.  He told me it seemed like a hypomanic episode.\n\nMy question is how do they know it's this?  I've had them say I suffer from GAD, Depression, ect.  I've been on multiple meds that made me worse and have similar events happen on them (one even leading to hospitalization which I think is from the meds I was on).  I'm currently on some different meds and it seems like it's helped since the hospitalization. I feel like they are just throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks,  how can I be sure that this time is right and they aren't uprooting my life for a thing that hopefully sticks to the wall this time?",

        "Text": "tl;dr How do you keep going when things are hard? \n \nSo I‚Äôm a senior in college (22) and I managed to make it this far without needing to go on leave. I go to a small liberal arts college on the east coast away from my family who live in the southwest. Over the last 3 years a lot has happened: I had a major concussion my freshman year, I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and started transitioning my sophomore year, I started bipolar meds and testosterone while abroad in Australia my junior year and got engaged to my fiance last semester, this summer I navigated an intense surgery recovery away from my family and bought a car after my family car was crushed by a fallen tree. Coming into this semester of school I was already very burnt out from a summer of navigating my health and car situations while also trying to conduct independent undergraduate research. I‚Äôve been trying to keep on top of my assignments but I‚Äôm also working two work study jobs at a total of 15-20hrs/week. Most importantly, this semester I have to write my senior thesis. It has to be 8000-10000 words and I am really behind schedule on the research for it let alone writing it too. \n\nI feel completely burnt out. So far I‚Äôve gotten in all my assignments but I‚Äôve been missing class like crazy and I think I‚Äôm in one of the worst depressive episodes I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve been fluctuating between mixed episodes and really intense depression for like 3 weeks. Last Thursday I was supposed to turn in the prospectus of my thesis and I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I didn‚Äôt have enough done and now the work that I have to do feels insurmountable. I feel like I‚Äôve hit my limit and there‚Äôs just no more gas in the tank. After a couple consecutive nights of not really feeling safe alone and being on crisis lines my therapist and academic dean recommended that I stay with my partner (4hrs away) for a couple days. I‚Äôve been with her since Saturday night. My thesis advisor says my work so far (annotated bib, lit review) has been great and it would be a shame if I went on medical leave. I have two friends at my university that are also bipolar and they‚Äôve both taken time off from school. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best path forward. Obviously it would be ideal if I could get myself back on track with my thesis and graduate on time in May 2025. My parents really want me to push through whatever I‚Äôm experiencing right now and finish this semester. I‚Äôm scared of a lot of things right now. 1) The further I push myself the closer I get to hurting myself or trying to at least. 2) What if I‚Äôm just really not cut out for hard work and I won‚Äôt be able to finish this degree let alone hold a job (basically I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm not bipolar just lazy or that I am bipolar but it will always ruin things for me).  3) Right now doing work just frustrates me and makes me angry at myself and deeply sad. If that‚Äôs how work will always feel for me, what‚Äôs the point of getting a degree and trying to make a living? 4) If I‚Äôm really at my limit, what if I leave school and never come back? \n\nThe past couple years I‚Äôve really just felt like Sisyphus just pushing that boulder up the hill just to fall and get back up again. I feel hopeless that I‚Äôll never feel any differently about the academic work I have to do. Any advice on how to keep going when things are really hard? I wanna give up. \n",

My parents refused to allow me to take antidepressants because they thought they should only be used in ‚Äúextreme cases‚Äù, and since I was never the can‚Äôt get out of bed type they said my depression must have been very mild. \n\nBut as soon as I got diagnosed as bipolar suddenly people believed I had actual problems. People see bipolar as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mental illness, and unipolar depression less so. Even people who take unipolar depression seriously still see it as a much milder illness than bipolar. \n\nIt‚Äôs not that I _want_ to have bipolar, but when I do have it it‚Äôs nice to have the label.

Job to job. Relationship to relationship. Place to place. Mania, then back to my families house more than 4 times. I take a mood stabilizer, which helps... But it still doesn't take away the depression and bad thoughts I'm consumed with whenever I get my feelings hurt with my high sensitivity. I feel defeated by life in every way. I try to do the right things, enroll back in school, mend my relationships with the people that love me then something hits me like a brick wall, then I'm back to the mania, filled with drugs, drinking, and surrounding myself around people who don't care. Bipolar 2 is cyclical and id do anything to escape the cycle. The depression waves at night. The misunderstood feelings. \"Did you take your medicine\" \"Your medicine makes you so tired\". What hurts the most is being misunderstood..... My family making it seem like, I'm some kind of disgusting adult who can't just get her shit together. I wish someone could understand that my disorder or condition or illness or whatever you want to call it is real and intense and that I didn't ask to be this way. I am trying really hard to just live normally, but why is it so hard for me? I'm so sensitive, I can't sit still, I can't even keep a job for long because I get manic.

I even went through the death of a parent earlier this year without having an episode. \n\nIt all ended when I was already a little wonky on sleep and very social. I met a woman at a party and instantly became obsessed. I mean, texting her all day every day, fantasizing about her, calling my husband (out of town) to open our marriage, coming out as bi to anyone who would listen, staying up all night planning how to make a move on her. I couldn't work, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I HAD to kiss her ASAP. I knew it was happening but I was like 'I'll take the olanzapine after I make out with her'. I started to crash the day before she came over to hang out. When the day came, I was out of it, I was weird about questions about my husband, weird about my very real plans to get pregnant next year, weird about everything. I felt like a totally different person.\n\nI've slept three nights in a row now and I'm like oh my god!!! What!!! I'm looking back at our texts and she gave no flirty vibes. She is gay but totally gave friend boundaries when we hung out. Was she even flirting with me at the party? Do I even have a crush on her?? I have a very loving stable marriage and I'm so excited to start a family -- like why was I hiding that? All this over someone I met 10 days ago. It's all so embarrassing!! ",

I‚Äôm very nervous because it‚Äôs been SUPER helpful for my depression and insomnia, but not so much for anxiety. It‚Äôs also REALLY difficult to wake up on time if I don‚Äôt attempt to wake up at least an hour earlier than needed - because after 4 alarms, my partner leaving lights on, and even a bed-shaker alarm, it‚Äôs STILL difficult to get out of bed. \n\nI have been taking 300 mg at night for some time now. My psych recently prescribed an additional 50mg to be taken in the morning to help with anxiety after trying clonidine and Guanfacine. It was fine for the first few weeks, but now when I take the 50mg, it almost knocks me out during work. \n\nI‚Äôve tried lots of meds with little success. I often can‚Äôt handle the side effects - the akathisia from a few days on a tiny dose of Abilify was debilitating.\n\nThe only other med that has helped the depression significantly was Lamictal - and I ended up developing a blistering rash on my face from that. \n\nI‚Äôm absolutely positive that many of you will relate. \n\nSo please, if you‚Äôve got any similar experiences, I would be so grateful if you would share them and what has actually been helpful for you.",

        "Text": "Hi! I've been really struggling with determining whether in fact I'm bipolar II- apologies for the long post but I really \n\nA quick background - In my adolescence I was severely depressed and suicidal but never self-harmed or anything like that. \n\n**School:** A few years ago, just as I started school, I was struggling with a really bad breakup. I then  was anxious and depressed all the time, but I could get along fine and mask all of my feelings. I spoke to a friend about it though, however,  and mentioned that I might have anxiety. I then went to a doc and got prescribed SSRIs. After about a few days I went to this networking event, and I was very chatty and talkative. Someone close to me mentioned that I didn't act myself ‚Äì that I was kind of a whole different person, but honestly I chalked that up to being really anxious (and these networking events always make me feel like I have to put on a mask anyway). All was well, and I was really excited and hyper. I got in the car with some friends, and someone mentioned something that really irked me and I just yelled and got angry. After a bit, someone else flipped me off as a joke and I got so angry and yelled again. (I should preface that this isn't entirely unusual, I used to get embarrassed a lot as a kid by peers and there have been moments where, when I get embarrassed, I reacted by yelling ‚ÄìI no longer do this at all).  Now, I've heard that hypomania could cause irritability. But here's the thing ‚Äì the next day I was really depressed because of everyone's reaction about it and starting to fear what people would think. I read hypomania is supposed to last a few days and I just went straight into anxiety and worry and maybe a bit of depression. I switched antidepressants anyway and the next year, it wasn't like I was happy, I was just super anxious ‚ÄìI cycled through every single antidepressant for an entire year and nothing worked. I just smoked a lot of weed, listened to music, and tried my best to repair relationships, but I do think that maybe I was a little \"erratic\" ‚ÄìI was also on a benzo the entire time. \n\n  \nI ended up stopping antidepressants for good and just smoked weed. For about another year  I was really depressed about going into my career, and just avoided thinking about it by smoking a lot of weed ‚Äì I was impulsive in that I got a big dog and I didn't really think too much about it but it wasn't like I was doing anything terrible or had super high highs. I would describe that year as mainly irritable and anxious. \n\n  \nA few years later, there were these moments where I would get extremely excited about something. A photographer that I just found out, a book, a film, finding out the benefits of exercise in relation to neurotransmitters and how that could change my life ‚Äì ideas that really uplifted me and I felt that I could make my entire life. I relished those moments and I got really happy about them but soon after I couldn't maintain my enthusiasm. \n\n  \n**The big event**:  I should mention I am a religious person ‚Äì one day I did this gratitude mediation - where I understood that no one is better than anyone else and was just grateful for what I had- I did this for about an hour. Afterwards, it was like every thought I had was a blessing. I was happy about everything. I was happy about a fold on my bed sheet and because I do truly believe in God, I felt that well God puts everything in my path, and wills all things, so everything is designed to make me happy and be gentle towards me. Every single person was  a guest of God. I was not concerned with status, I was happy as I could have ever been. I was funny. I was charismatic again. I felt like I I felt when I was a kid without any of my trauma baggage. I was okay and I knew everything would be okay. But the feeling kind of went away after a few months until the mindset truly dissipated. then I got depressed again, and then there were moments again where I got really happy for a couple weeks just based on a new perspective I had about life or a new art that I really loved.  Then its just kind of been depression and anxiety ever since \n\nIt cycles through this, where I get really okay ‚Äìbut it feels like it is really based on a new perspective that I get. Like understanding everyone is deserving of value or that I will be taken care of by God or that my destiny will be beautiful. It has been like this where I get really excited about something, especially a new mindset or a new way of thinking of things, and then it goes away. \n\n  \nHere's the problem, I'm really skeptical that I am bipolar. I also have ADHD, and I almost more so believe that novel ways of thinking of things and ADHD preference for novelty might be influencing these mood swings. \n\nI also do have trouble sleeping with racing thoughts but I do always sleep every night. \n\n  \nDoes any of this resonate with anyone? Have you had similar experiences? Could you still have hypomania if when you do something stupid when you're hypomanic and realize that it was stupid, you end up depressed and anxious (I thought hypomania just goes on?)  Please help!! Let me know if I could provide any more information! \n\n",

I also want to say that I started my work day feeling paranoid that everyone knew my business but that slowly went away and I just feel really good! I don't know if that's just the meds working or if it's hypomania I'm still very knew to the diagnosis and I'm not quite sure when to recognize episodes and also what to even expect from the medication and whether episodes can still happen. It's a weird feeling to be completely honest. I've felt this way before though during a hypomanic episode but I don't know if that's what's happening right now or if that can happen on meds. I also feel like I'm not even bipolar even though I got the diagnosis. If that makes sense. Like how do I know? Sorry this is probably a mess. Anyways could use some Input/advice. ",

It was super toxic and I ended up cheating on him while he was in rehab. I feel like I just went nuts after over a year of doing my best to not drown (I was the only one working and we have 2 small children). I ended up homeless (by choice through my actions) and when I decided I was either dead or done I called him because I didn't know who else to turn to. I didn't expect him to do anything other than drop me off with family but we ended up naturally just coming back together and decided to work things out. \nBut now we're trying to heal our relationship whilst in recovery and it's just a lot. I can't seem to not feel disgusted with my self constantly and it affects us both. In the bedroom especially. And I love him and want to be with him but I just don't know how to fix anything when I hate my self so much. I don't know how to talk to him in a productive way when he brings up \"some other dude fucking me\". It's not been all bad and he's done a lot of healing. I can't say what's a right or wrong way to feel about me or what I've done. But I'm to the point that if I know if I can't figure this out I'll lose him for good and I just can't handle that. \nAnyway, sorry again for long post and there's so much to unpack here.

Told me I was on too many meds, asked why I was on so many meds now but only used to be on 1-2, acted like she'd just watched me smoke crack when she found a .25 mg Klonopin wrapper (which I took because I felt myself spiraling into a panic attack and that's what my Dr told me to do in such instances, and which I only take abut once a week), implied that my doctor is a quack and doesn't know what he's doing, and made me promise her (a promise I have decided to break) that I would go to see a new doctor (even though I've seen 3 plus a clinical therapist in the past 1.5 years, all who agree on Dx of bipolar, PTSD and ADHD and, for the most part, the medication I'm on.) She even recommended that I go off all my meds and start over- wtf?\n\nIt all started with a fight during which I admittedly blew up at her. Recently, my therapist told me she thinks I've been rapid-cycling...my Dr also agreed that some mania was breaking through. So I have been extra sensitive and explosive, which I take accountability for. Yesterday, though, it felt like my mom was blaming me for having bipolar, for my brain working the way it does. I don't sleep well and all she kept telling me was that I needed to get my sleep, stop drinking energy drinks and go off my adhd meds (which I need to keep my job...have already gotten fired from two in the past 6 years and I'm a full custodian single mother who receives 0 child support payments.) She even blamed my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years now and, if anything, is constantly advocating for me to follow doctors orders and take my condition seriously.\n\nShe was acting like I was a drug addict. And this means nothing against addicts, I can totally relate and, in fact, do think that a lot of bipolar people, including myself, are addicted to mania/hypo so maybe there's some truth there. But, still, I wanted her to see that there is something deeper going on that I really cannot get a grip on. That my behaviors are symptomatic of that. No, I don't want a pass for being an asshole but I do want to be seen by my own mother. Everyone does. I'm so confused already by the rapid cycling, which has been going on for about 1.5 years, constantly being a different person and all the stress it's putting my mind and body through--her onslaught of opinions were not at all helpful. For some reason, her acting like something was wrong with me because I used to only be on two medications (which stopped working) and now am on 5 feels especially hurtful. It just felt so invalidating. \n\nI have been very honest with my psychiatrist and therapist because I DO want to get to the bottom of where I'm at right now. But I don't think adding any other opinions or doctors to the mix is going to be helpful. What do you guys think? I'm very interested in hearing if anyone has had similar experiences.",

I started taking meds for BP2 under the guidance of a psychiatrist on August 1, so I'm 3 months in to getting treatment for something that has been a reality in my life for a long time. \n\nI'm still coming to terms with the diagnosis and the fact that I'm on medication, and I have some worries about the future, so I'd love to hear from folks who are thriving while living with BP2. \n\nSome questions that are on my mind... (feel free to answer any of these, or none at all!)\n\nWhat's your life like? How long have you had your diagnosis? What has helped you accept yourself or to fight internalized stigma, if applicable?\n\nDo you have a partner? I'm single and not sure how I'm going to be able to find a life partner who will accept my BP2. How did you and your SO navigate conversations about it?\n\nDo you disclose it to your supervisor/HR at work? Are there any accommodations for work or school for BP2 that you've found helpful, or is this a non-starter?\n\nMore questions may arise, but these are a few off the top of my head. Thank you so much in advance <3",

        "Text": "Hi guys! I am very confused and would like some opinions. To start, I have very bad anxiety and OCD so when I was around 15 I was prescribed zoloft. After a few hours of taking it I felt incredible. Like night and day. Went to the doctors for my follow up and I mentioned how much better I felt so quickly and she said I must have had very low serotonin if the Zoloft worked within a few hours. Also mentioned how my pupils were very dilated but she said it was normal. Hadn‚Äôt thought about it since then. But I went off the meds because my doctor dropped me. Was off of them for like a year. Anxiety/ocd got really bad! Got a new doctor and started zoloft again. Well, the experience was not at all like the first time. In fact, within around 6 hours I felt AWFUL. I was extremely agitated, I felt ‚Äò‚Äôoff‚Äô‚Äô like I wanted to jump out of my body. Also I have been sober from alcohol for 9 months. Something I never thought possible. I haven‚Äôt thought or wanted to drink in 9 months. But after taking the medication I wanted to party (aka do dr$gs and drink). I was talking to my boyfriend about how I was feeling and we decided to do some research. And what we found was that it could be bipolar 2. Something that he‚Äôs been telling me I might have for 2 years. But I never wanted to believe it (idk why). Going to call my doctor and make an appointment but either way I need a psychiatrist to assess me which will take months. I guess this is more of a vent post. Not even sure if I have bipolar 2. Still feeling a bit off and it‚Äôs been 3 days since I took it. Would I be okay if I waited a few months to see the psychiatrist? What should I do? üôÅ",

Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I‚Äôm not feeling that way.\n\nI have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don‚Äôt even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don‚Äôt understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.\n\nI started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it‚Äôs unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don‚Äôt feel right about it. I‚Äôm an adult, so I should just be happy, right?\n\nThe problem is, I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. Knowing that I‚Äôm supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn‚Äôt even want to tell anyone I‚Äôd been accepted because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can‚Äôt just not go.\n\nNobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don‚Äôt want to start this job. I‚Äôm not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what else to do. There‚Äôs only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can‚Äôt bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don‚Äôt appeal to me.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.\n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this.\n",

        "Text": "So, yeah, my mom med-shamed me yesterday. Told me I was on too many meds, asked why I was on so many meds now but only used to be on 1-2, acted like she'd just watched me smoke crack when she found a .25 mg Klonopin wrapper (which I took because I felt myself spiraling into a panic attack and that's what my Dr told me to do in such instances), implied that my doctor is a quack and doesn't know what he's doing, and made me promise her (a promise I have decided to break) that I would go to see a new doctor (even though I've seen 3 plus a clinical therapist in the past 1.5 years, all who agree on Dx of bipolar, PTSD and ADHD and, for the most part, the medication I'm on.) She even recommended that I go off all my meds and start over- wtf?   \n\nIt all started with a fight during which I admittedly blew up at her. Recently, my therapist told me she thinks I've been rapid-cycling...my Dr also agreed that some mania was breaking through. So I have been extra sensitive and explosive, which I take accountability for. Yesterday, though, it felt like my mom was blaming me for having bipolar, for my brain working the way it does. I don't sleep well and all she kept telling me was that I needed to get my sleep, stop drinking energy drinks and go off my adhd meds (which I need to keep my job...have already gotten fired from two in the past 6 years and I'm a full custodian single mother who receives 0 child support payments.) She even blamed my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years now and, if anything, is constantly advocating for me to follow doctors orders and take my condition seriously. \n\nShe was acting like I was a drug addict. And this means nothing against addicts, I can totally relate and, in fact, do think that a lot of bipolar people, including myself, are addicted to mania/hypo so maybe there's some truth there. But, still, I wanted her to see that there is something deeper going on that I really cannot get a grip on. That my behaviors are symptomatic of that. No, I don't want a pass for being an asshole but I do want to be seen by my own mother. Everyone does. I'm so confused already by the rapid cycling, which has been going on for about 1.5 years, constantly being a different person and all the stress it's putting on my mind and body through--her onslaught of opinions were not at all helpful. For some reason, her acting like something was wrong with me because I used to only be on two medications (which stopped working) and now am on 5 feels especially hurtful.\n\nI have been very honest with my psychiatrist and therapist because I DO want to get to the bottom of where I'm at right now. But I don't think adding any other opinions or doctors to the mix is going to be helpful. What do you guys think? I'm very interested in hearing if anyone has had similar experiences.   ",

These medicines have saved a lot of people. \n\nBut besides that, I took bupropion + abilify. I started with abilify and was more ok, maybe, but it gave me anxiety and akathisia. I put bupropion on it. For some reason I've already taken it 4 times, including this one. The last two times, including this one, my brain fried. The first time there was a very bad context, so I thought it wasn't the medicine. I went completely crazy. Now that I have nothing, I can look back and realize how anxious I was. I was completely taken over by racing, depressive thoughts, I didn't eat, I didn't sleep. \n\nI told my doctor, stopped taking the medication. I went back to lithium (I had already tried it) which also gave me bad side effects again. Dermatological. I'm off of anything. \n\nSomething happened to my brain. I know that the brain is constantly changing and that I was already depressed and anxious before, but I feel like something has changed more than I expected and for the worse. I can't think of ANYTHING good. I know I'm depressed, But I was depressed in a different way before, I don't know how to explain it. I'm feeling everything differently. I can't even bring myself to want to see my friends, talk to them, think about listening to music. My brain even feels weird. I don't know if it was the withdrawal that was or if it's being terrible. Before I used to eat, even too much, now I still have difficulty eating. I don't care because I need to lose weight, but I know it's not just negativity from thinking about the medicine. Something happened inside. \n\nI'm holding to to the fact that the brain is plastic and that it has changed for the worst, maybe it will change for the better. My last resort is Latuda, but I've been scared since taking abilify. \nIt's been a year and I've already forgotten, but I think I was less unhappy taking SSRIs.\n",

Friday night I snapped and yelled at both my bosses. Last night I didn‚Äôt yell at anyone or snap at anyone I was just upset and it was very obvious. I came home mad and then once I finally calmed down I just cried for over an hour. I hate that I lost control. I hate that I couldn‚Äôt keep it together long enough to finish the shift.

Lately, I‚Äôve started skipping my dose pretty regularly either because I know taking them will make me feel sickly because of the taste, or because I‚Äôm too tired/taking them will wake me up too much to sleep because I hate them so much. \n\nI also, of course, struggle with depression and sometimes popping them out of that blister pack (let‚Äôs give it up for the blister pack btw, peeling off that little paper and getting them out of it is also such a hassle) and ingesting them is just too much for me to do üò≠ I also have ADHD so that exacerbates the problem.\n\nIt‚Äôs a fizzy tablet, so I can‚Äôt hide it in food. Carbonated drinks make the pill fizz even faster so that‚Äôs out of the question.\n\nDo you guys have any tips for getting this shit down? I looked into med coat (this pill coating for kids to remove the taste), but it would cost me roughly 10 bucks a day with the dose I‚Äôm on, so it‚Äôs out of the question.\n\nI‚Äôve realised over the last couple of days that taking this medicine every damn day of my life until I shall perish, if I don‚Äôt happen on some revolutionary trick, is just out of the question. Quetaphine is out of the question because it made me gain weight before i nixed it.\n\nI‚Äôm currently delaying bedtime because I dread taking this medication so damn much. Any advice?:/ Unless I find a hack for this I‚Äôm going to talk to my doctor about just roughing it.\n\nThanks for any insights and sorry for the rant ü©∑",

I'm not having all the symptoms I usually do, and they're not as all-consuming as they have been historically. It could, of course, just be that I'm not at full strength hypomania yet, I'm still unsure. Anyway, I'm curious if and how anyone else's episodes have changed with medication. ",

My current psychiatrist, whom I've only been seeing for a couple of months, doesn't seem to be current, and only considers textbook bipolar 1 symptoms as relevant. I asked to be evaluated for bipolar and all he did was send me a screening tool for present mania.\n\nA little background (not asking for a diagnosis, just providing context):\n\nI'm 41f and have been treated for my mental health since I was about 12. I have had many diagnoses of depression, anxiety, borderline, autism, ADHD, (c)PTSD. \n\nA psychiatrist I had 10 years ago briefly tried Lamictal for me but didn't tell me why. I was on it very briefly and blamed it when I went maybe a little psychotic and stabbed myself in the arm. My current psychiatrist also does not take any past possible psychosis seriously, since I didn't have obvious delusions or hallucinations (even though I have driven people away by being accusatory).\n\nI've also had periods in the past where I dress totally differently, where I bought a wedding dress when I wasn't engaged, where I impulsively bought a motorcycle (which I had never ridden before), etc. \n\nI don't seem to have much luck with SSRIs and SNRIs (and I get a lot of side effects). \n\nAnyway, this is all why I want to be seriously evaluated for bipolar, and I'm feeling like maybe I need to see a different psychiatrist. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on finding someone better.",

I was having horrible social anxiety and (later learned/realized) I was in a mixed episode. It was my first time meeting his friend. The first night went great! Then the anxiety set in. \n\nI knew I wasn't ok, so I got a hotel room, but there ended up being SO MUCH DRAMA! I can't begin to explain details and they probably don't matter. We ended up fighting, I was a dick in front of his friend, I thought I might need to commit myself, and my best friend did an emergency call with my BF to talk me down. \n\nWe are visiting again. I'm not doing great. I'm on edge, and they feel less welcoming. (One thing I've learned though, is how much I project). Everyone is being nice, but I'm ashamed and on edge. I can't vent to my BF because he's on edge too. \n\nI wonder if it would help if I called it out and apologized? I don't know if it's better to pretend nothing happened and act normal, or face it head on and say something like, \"hey, I know I was not ok last time we met, something about anxiety, something about thank you for inviting me back into your home\" but I don't even know if it's on their mind! \n\nI really do want to hide in a hole. But I'm in a better place, better medicated. I'm also pressuring the crap out of myself to make a better impression and BE F'N NORMAL. \n\nI hate this. I miss the days of unmedicated oblivion and feeling right. Thank you for understanding... üíú",

Had to rush when walking the rest of the way to the plasma center because I had to use the bathroom very bad but luckily no accidents and I made it . \n\nThen during the plasma giving I listened to music and then an hour later I was finished and received 90 bucks that was loaded on the card they give you. I always take the money out and put the money back into my varo bank card. \n\nAs I went to seven eleven I noticed a guy with an open bear in his hand and noodles . As soon as I walk out then go to CVS to load my varo card then walk out of that store, the same guy was trying to get me to do something for him. I was walking fast and he still didn't get the hint. He had some dollars. I guess he wanted me to buy him some beer or vodka. \n\nLike dude I have no criminal record nor am I going to just jump into drama or get involved in with a total stranger. I guess he got the hint once I get walking and politely said no with my right hand . \n\nNow I can buy more chicken and Mac and cheese for food and try not to go berserk when I go to Starbucks, which is my safe haven. That's the place where I write lyrics and enjoy my coffee and free refills for coffee. \n\nFood stamps reload on the fifth. And if unemployment denies me next week I can get on short term disability and it just takes 1 week and I have to pick up my refill for olanzapine that the doctor inputted in the system yesterday . So busy but productive day. \n\nAnd I learned when I feel ballistic inside it's best to slowly breathe and not talk to any friends or family. \n\n",

I am consistently joyless and disinterested in the world around me. I‚Äôve been reluctant to change meds, because I am afraid of the trial and error and terrified that things could get worse. I get monthly Ketamine ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù infusions that I do enjoy very much. Last month my treatment was amazing - fully immersed and disassociated. It was so intense that I wondered if I‚Äôd received the wrong dose. In the month since that treatment, I‚Äôve been incredibly self-aware. I feel good. I‚Äôve made lists and checked off tasks. I‚Äôve been less irritable. One of my accomplishments was to go see my doc. We both agreed this is likely a hypomanic episode. In my current state, I can recognize that I‚Äôve been here MANY times before - to different degrees at different time periods (but never diagnosed BP). I‚Äôve had periods of successful relationships. I‚Äôve purchased my own home. I have completed college for 2 whole different careers. I completed nursing school 7 yrs ago (2 yr LPN program).  I left a clinic job 2 years ago to take care of my disabled mom full time(against my doctors recommendations). I have worked with a therapist, but usually only when I‚Äôm doing good. I keep my circle very small, so most people would assume that I have my shit together. But most of my time is spent doing the bare minimum to get by.\n\nSorry so long‚Ä¶ because I‚Äôve never had full blown Mania, or psychosis etc. - my doc says we can let it play out for a while and treat for BP2 when the hypomania passes. That makes me so sad - to think that this feels so right. Why can‚Äôt it be like this all the time. If I change up my meds, will I ever be able to get back ‚Äúhere‚Äù.

The doctors have been unable to find a medication that works for me and I am in incredible pain every day, unable to use my hands, and having many symptoms related to the uncontrolled inflammation. \n\nI am not interested in changing any of my meds, and am not accepting any advice about my RA. \n\nI have had my bipolar stable for many years leading up to this summer/fall where my RA has been its worst, and my bipolar has been hard to control. About a month ago, my psychiatrist increased my dosage of Geodon due to anxiety, and my rage has never been worse.\n\nI usually rage about the same things: doing makeup/hair, the weight i've gained because of this all, and when I'm exhausted, and am more irritable in general about everything. I feel the worst i've ever felt about myself as well. I described it as \"wanting to skin myself\" to my husband\n\nThe rage is disproportionate to the circumstances, but also makes sense due to how much my hands hurt/don't work right, how my health insurance is refusing to cover the RA meds I need, and how my life is just getting worse and worse due to these illnesses. I accidentally take it out on my husband sometimes, but always catch myself and apologize.\n\nThe rage seems to break through the meds and I don't know where it's coming from. I‚Äôm guessing it's mania, but I don't have any of the symptoms I normally have when manic. I also usually get deeply depressed this time of year, not manic, so that's why I‚Äôm confused. \n\nIf any of you have experienced this and what worked for you, or might know what's going on, I would love to hear from you!\n\nThank you!",

Me as a person, an identity.\n\nNot all, but a lot of other people have the luxury of growing up always being in control, ultimately, of what they do and what they say, and so they can figure out social dynamics and how to conduct themselves accordingly, as well as generally consistently and ‚Äúnormally‚Äù. They make friends and get close with people in a normal, natural way. Who they are as a person forms accordingly around that, until eventually there is a person with a distinct personality, demeanor, and way of acting. Stable. \n\nMy bipolar started when I first hit puberty, around twelve or so. I was already a weird kid because I lived in a profoundly mentally abusive household. The manifestation of this sealed the deal. That I wouldn‚Äôt get that experience. And I didn‚Äôt. I lived and still live in a constant state of change that never grounds itself. I keep trying to make meds work, but there‚Äôs no foundation of a person to latch onto. Too much turmoil to build.\n\nI sometimes reflect on a childhood of being the ‚Äúweird‚Äù kid that other kids outright admitted to being scared of. I lived in an ocean of disconnection, and the violent motion of my experience of life ripped every part of what I could‚Äôve grown to be back into the formless oblivion they were before. It leaves me just. Feeling like I was born empty, and will always be. There‚Äôs an endless sea of waves inside of my body that billow nowhere, just up and down in a ceaseless rhythm that I can‚Äôt figure out how to let anyone hear. I don‚Äôt know that anyone is able to, really. I‚Äôm pretty sure the only thing I ever manage is a fucking foghorn of emotion that scares the life out of people with its intensity and sound. \n\nI‚Äôm not really sure why I‚Äôm writing this, but I figure the point of subreddits like this are to yell into a random crowd of people just like you and let em do what they will with what they read. I‚Äôm high in my car hiding in the garage at 7am after I bashed my head into this headrest I‚Äôm leaning against like a fucking lunatic just yesterday. Been tweaking myself out from overly intense emotions lately which terrorizes my loved ones in the crossfire. Literally sobbing my lungs out at random where no one else can hear (‚Ä¶I spend a LOT of time in my car in the garage lol). \n\nIncreasing meds soon, but I honestly don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to make a dent on something I concluded yesterday, which is that one day soon, I am going to be a part of the robust suicide statistic people with our disorder have. I was fucked from the start and I live the consequences of those everyday, and I am becoming exhausted with the battle of trying to pretend to be sane. I don‚Äôt know how the fuck you‚Äôre supposed to survive and thrive when your earliest years of development were abject neglect, violence and instability, and your formative adolescent years were spent rapidly cycling almost nonstop. \n\nMaybe I‚Äôm being impatient, but it feels like I‚Äôm building who I am on top of a fucking void instead of a foundation. Sometimes I feel as though my skin hides that void, like I‚Äôm some sort of weird flesh balloon. Most of the time my insides just feel raw, though. Heavy with pain. That might just be my chronic pain talking, though. PT and painkillers help, but it‚Äôs always there. \n\nDoes this resonate with literally anyone or have I crossed some sort of bizarre-o threshold. Has anyone else been bipolar since puberty? \n\nLast note: ‚ÄúHole in the Earth‚Äù by Daughter is the vibe of my particular blend of bipolar. Daughter is a really good band to cry to if you need to prompt it. ‚ÄúMother‚Äù or ‚ÄúLandfill‚Äù or ESPECIALLY ‚ÄúSmother‚Äù are the best ones to break down to. You‚Äôre welcome üôå ",

I have sadly gained 85 pounds on this. I have been wanting to get off this drug for awhile now & I just haven‚Äôt had any luck. I try to taper down but all I can handle is 200mg I can‚Äôt go lower then I just get back to 300 & stay on that.\nI been on this shot for 3 months now. \nI took the first dose which was 10 units at the beginning & did that for 4 weeks or little bit longer. I slowly started feeling different about foods. I decided to go up to 20 because my appetite was still there & it‚Äôs hard while being on Seroquel. So I went up to 20 & oh my the fatigue was horrible I even took multivitamins,D3,B12 & nothing worked.\nMy next shot day I went to 15 instead hoping that will work, well it didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶.I was so irritable it was bad. So I tried one more time & I did 10units one day then 4 days later another 10units to see if that helps with the side effects & it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not helping my appetite. It‚Äôs just making me feel like straight shit MENTALLY. \nThis was another reason why I didn‚Äôt won‚Äôt to get on it because I was scared it would mess me up mentally. \nBut my mom was convincing me & my sister is on it & I knew others as well on it that were fine on it so I said hell why not let‚Äôs try it that I may not even get those side effects. \nIt may worked on them but it did not work on me sadly. It messed me up mentally. I have been just down,moody,irritable etc..\nI really hate that it didn‚Äôt work for me. \nIt‚Äôs so hard to lose weight while you‚Äôre on Seroquel. \nI‚Äôve tried eating better & going for better choices in sweets & stuff as well & it doesn‚Äôt help but I‚Äôm still going to keep doing that or at least try my best.\nIt‚Äôs not easy. Seroquel makes you want to eat like crazy & when it comes to sweets oh my it‚Äôs horrible!!\nI‚Äôm going to try & find me a physiatrist after the holidays & help me get off this drug & on to something else. Maybe I can start losing the weight I‚Äôve gained on it. \nI was thinking about after I get off Seroquel to try that Tirzepatide to help lose the weight I gained. \nI know I‚Äôve seen people saying that it‚Äôs better for people like me that won‚Äôt mess with your mental health like Semaglutide did. But that‚Äôs gonna be awhile from now. \nI just want to start feeling back to myself. \nI hate feeling like this. \nIt sucks so bad that the so called miracle drug didn‚Äôt help me accomplish what I needed done. & I‚Äôm so frustrated because maybe if I didn‚Äôt have mental health problems it would have possibly worked. \nMENTAL HEALTH suckssss. \nI‚Äôm done venting.\n\n\n",

But my anxiety meds didn‚Äôt work. I began having difficulty staying asleep, waking up at 3:00 am. I started noticing I was having racing thoughts, which I‚Äôve had before due to anxiety. But the thoughts were different. I was daydreaming about doing crazy things like leaving my family and moving far away for adventure, or quitting my career and going back to college. I can‚Äôt focus at work or on my hobbies because the irritability is so strong and uncomfortable. These episodes have been lasting several days, then I feel fine. \n\nI‚Äôve started taking an antipsychotic and I feel so much better. I also now take a mood stabilizer.\n\nDoes this sound like hypo mania to you? I was always under the impression that mania was a good feeling where people feel on top of the world, but mania for me seems to be severe irritability.\n\nAny advice on ways to avoid future manic episodes besides medication?",

        "Text": "TW: self harm, suicidality\n\nI've been reflecting a lot recently on all the ways suicidality has affected my life, my own life and those I love. I finally wrote it all out and needed somewhere to share and get it off my chest. I hate the term \"commit suicide,\" because it feels like your committing a crime. This is my writing to express how that feels to hear. Please always know help is out there. Please call or text 988 if you're in crisis. This is only an expression of how it feels to be in my deepest lows. I was diagnosed BPII in 2021, but my symptoms have been around for a long time. \n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nThe first time suicide touched my life I had no way of knowing how often it would come back. \n\nI'm 14. A mere child, on the verge of the \"golden years.\" A young girl in my highschool died by suicide and the school had no idea how to handle it. I was at a tumbling class with my cheerleading squad when we got the news, and our tumbling coach did a better job than anyone actually addressing it. I learned adults don't know what to do either. \n\nI'm 16. I smoke my hookah pen in the silence of my bedroom. The thoughts are loud today. My dad has so many old medications, for sleep, for anxiety, the like. I just had surgery and have heavy duty pain medications. I wonder, how many does it take to end it all? I Google it and receive the number for a hotline I refuse to call. I'm not going to commit suicide, I just don't want to be here I repeat over and over again. I can't commit to an eternity of unknowns. But what if? I remember the moment so clearly, the meds in my hand, the water to my left. I was ready, until I got a text from my significant other. Not yet. I learn that even in others company, it's possible to feel deep loneliness. \n\nI'm 17. My significant other is struggling and I'm all alone in helping them to cope. They have a steady decline over the course of a week until they stop responding. I rush over to their house and run up to their bedroom only to find they had all their pills in their hand ready to take, tears streaming down their face. I stopped them, and held them as they cried. I learned even family doesn't always notice when things get bad. \n\nI'm 19 years old, barely in college a few months. I made a friend who had never touched alcohol in his life. The friend went on a spiral after drinking for the first time, calling me at 3am feeling ready to die every morning for two weeks straight. He got so drunk at a frat house I had to help carry him out because the house didn't want to get in trouble. His pants were around his ankles, head in the toilet, screaming my name over and over. The next morning I receive the call at 3am, only this time he's physically hurt himself. I go into the boys bathroom to find him bleeding on the floor. I help clean off his wrists and bandage him up, and we sit together in the hallway while he cries. I tell him I can't keep doing this because I'm not a trained therapist and I need him to get help. Why is it always me? I don't know what to do either, but I know that feeling well. We call every option, the school counselor, the hotline, nothing is helpful. I learn our systems can't handle suicidality either. \n\nI am 19. Still. I'm so raw from holding my friends pain. I attempt to break up with my significant other, and they tell me they'll die by suicide if I leave. I cannot fathom such a fate to live with the rest of my life knowing. I beg. I plead. I call their mother. I ask anyone to check in, because I am 2 hours away and there's nothing I can physically do. His mother checks in with him, and it's the last time I hear her voice. I learn people leave, and I learn to hold heavy burdens alone. \n\nI'm 25. It's me again. My fiance and I have moved out of our apartment into a friend's apartment temporarily while our new condo is rehabed. I'm so low I can't even form the words. All I can think is how desperately I need it stop. I call my psychiatrist and she tells me to do an IOP program and never follows up. I am medicated. I never attend the program. I learn there's no one out there to help. \n\nI am 27. I can't keep going. I've come out to my family, and they forced me to come out to my husband's family. All I can feel is the hatred, the disgust, the need to \"save my soul.\" I feel so lonely. My movements have slowed, my appetite gone, and I dream every night of all my reasons for why I want to die. The flashbacks are on a loop. I can't take the pain anymore. \n\nIt's not a commitment, it's a last resort. ",

        "Text": "After my first and only manic episode one year ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. However, after spending time in subreddits and other self-research, I'm really confused as to why I was given BP2 and not BP1. I experienced psychosis during and I was hospitalized for it. I was diagnosed when I got out of the hospital by my university psychiatrist, who basically wasn't there for any of it lol.\n\nNow, I know official labels don't really mean that much, it's moreso if one's symptoms are being treated correctly. I've been taking daily antipsychotics since the hospital and have had only 1-2 very minor (hypo)manic feelings since, so I guess it's mostly been kept at bay. But would there be a benefit to being \"correctly\" diagnosed? I feel like keeping the bp2 label is going to reduce problems down the road (shoutout to ableism and stigma /s). But I also don't know if I'm screwing myself over by not getting reevaluated.\n\nWould appreciate hearing from anyone, especially if you have personal experience with being misdiagnosed as the \"wrong\" bipolar type! Thanks :)\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your replies (in this sub + r/bipolar)! Based on people's responses, I'm gonna go with my gut and just keep it as it is (as long as I don't get another manic episode..).",

        "Text": "These past 3-4 weeks have been rough because due to issues with my pharmacy I didn‚Äôt have access to my antipsychotics for a while and like many people with BP, suffer from insomnia. My insomnia has been on the more severe side lately (staying up for 55hrs+ at a time), which me and my psychiatrist believe was triggered by my lack of medication. I thought I‚Äôd be ok without them but after about a week I started showing signs of having a hypomanic/mixed episode. Then after about another week or so, a severe wave of depression hit me. I was already having a hard time, but then there were some things that I was looking forward to doing over the past two weeks that either got cancelled, (unintentionally) ruined by me, or just simply couldn‚Äôt happen. Due to me feeling down I was really looking forward to going out in hopes of lifting my spirits. I‚Äôve never been one to handle change very well, especially a sudden, unwanted, change in plans that I was looking forward to. \n\nI called out of work a couple of days ago bc my mental state (and my physical state, due to insomnia(nausea, vomiting/urge to vomit, migraines, fatigue) was just so bad I couldn‚Äôt bring my self to leave my room, attend any lectures, or even hardly eat. That being said, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to survive a shift at my job. But the next day I was feeling guilty because I have a habit of minimizing my mental health/BP problems. So I convinced myself that I was fine and wasn‚Äôt having any issues at all actually and was cool to go work. Which, evidently, was a poor decision. I lasted a good 15-20 minutes before I was bent over on the floor hyperventilating and crying. And to top it off, due to a lack of staff my district manager came in today and it was just me and her working together. It was our first time meeting so I certainly left rather intense first impression. My job ain‚Äôt particularly difficulty nor did any one thing trigger me while working. I was overcame with a wave of depression. \n\nI came from behind my desk and up to her‚Äôs, she was making a phone call and didn‚Äôt hear me initially when I tried to get her attention, but I guess eventually the sound of me hyperventilating got her to notice me. I tried my best to get my words out but all I could do was let out a few stutters in between breaths. I managed to say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm in pain‚Äù I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to finish my shift, so I figured saying it like this would get the point across that I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and needed to go home without lying. Because I was in pain, just not anything severe or visibly noticeable. I feel like I couldn‚Äôt say anything along the lines of me struggling due to mental health because I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have been taken seriously and likely would‚Äôve just been told to get back to work.\n\nEventually my district manger escorted me to the back room, away from the customers. I sat in that room for nearly an hour, in the dark (motion sensor lights and I was sitting pretty still). My district manger came in to check on me a couple of times, trying her best to get me to get back to work. Since I said I was in pain she offered me a pain reliever, I declined telling her it wouldn‚Äôt work. Nothing could calm me down, after an hour I was still hyperventilating, shaking, and crying. And after a while she gave me permission to leave work for the day. \n\nI felt so terribly guilty. It‚Äôs that time of year where every business is extremely busy and needs as many people working as possible. And I hated that I was inconveniencing so many people, I was already feeling horrible and now I‚Äôm feeling like a burden as well. I apologized a million times while still crying, hoping she wasn‚Äôt mad at me.\n\nAfter I left work, I messaged the manager that I work directly under about me leaving early, since she wasn‚Äôt there, and how I likely was not going to be able to return to work until around a week later due to my current state and lack of access to my medication. I also mentioned that I was dealing a chronic illness without specifying what illness it was exactly (because once again, I know alot of people wouldn‚Äôt take a mental health condition seriously, especially one as misunderstood as BP). \n\nWhile I was able to finally pick up my meds right before work, it can take several weeks for it to build up in my system and be effective. But I knew I couldn‚Äôt miss 4-6 weeks of work, even if they allowed it, I couldn‚Äôt afford to do so. So I gave an estimate of about a week until my meds atleast partially kicked in (idk if that‚Äôs how they actually work tbh) because I felt that then I could go to work without losing my mind or having an anxiety attack on the floor, even if I was feeling rundown, depressed, and unmotivated. \n\nMy manager was rather understanding and not mean about it and said she‚Äôd just need a doctor‚Äôs note confirming that I actually have a condition that could be preventing me from working. I thought that was reasonable request, so I reached out to my psychiatrist as soon as I got home. I‚Äôm currently  awaiting a response from my psychiatrist, but for as of now I‚Äôm not working for the next week or so and if I can‚Äôt get this doctor‚Äôs note I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm getting fired. Which would suck really bad because I legit just got this job at the beginner of October and really need it. \n\nMy anxiety and BP haven‚Äôt been this debilitating in a while, it was almost like I forgot how to handle  it. I was scared, like legitimately scared for myself. I have of course experienced suicidal ideation before, but in that moment it was so intense that I felt like I couldn‚Äôt get the thoughts of it to go away, and while the thoughts were persistent I wouldn‚Äôt say they were necessarily intrusive. \n\nHours later, I‚Äôm doing a bit better. I‚Äôve just been bedrotting since I got home. I‚Äôm just hoping next week is better for me and that I still have a job. Hopefully my meds get in my system faster than expected, because these past few weeks have been the hardest I‚Äôve had in along time. ",

        "Text": "I have been mildly hypomanic since the beginning of September which already puts me at risk for wanted to reinforce that ‚Äúbipolar 2 high‚Äù . Normally, however, I only have given in when I am DATING a heavy drinker. I haven‚Äôt dated in seven years so it has been quite a while since I have had any alcohol. Well, a week ago, I found out that my father is passing away. he is going to go in the best way possible, at his home with his loved ones around and he is in no pain. It‚Äôll probably be about a month or two from now. This has caused me to drink alone and that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever done this. I went from not drinking at all to just starting to drink alone at night. The most despicable part is that I measure out how much I‚Äôm drinking. (My stomach can ONLY tolerate cheap vodka I kid you not), but the only reason I even do that is because I‚Äôm terrified of overdoing my calories for the day ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑüò¨). So given the fact that I am measuring out the amount of vodka I drink, I know I‚Äôm not going insanely overboard. I will only go up to 4 ounces a day. But this is the first time in my 43 years of life on this earth that I have resorted to alcohol.\n(I admit I am a daily cannabis smoker, but I‚Äôve been a cannabis smoker most of my life and it does not seem to affect my bipolar because I have taken long several year breaks, and also smoke daily, but the cannabis has never made a difference in my mood swings or behavior. I want this to be said because I want to be completely informative and disclose everything, but I would just request that people refrain from opinions on cannabis because that is not something. I‚Äôm here to seek advice on. I‚Äôm only here to seek advice on the alcohol, thank you in advance. I genuinely appreciate it! I should also note that my psychiatrist is well aware of that.)\nI‚Äôm scared, however, that at some point, I‚Äôll just continue to eat less so I can drink more. I‚Äôm also on a small dosage of Klonopin, .25 in the morning. I make sure space it out appropriately with the Klonopin when I do drink, but it scares me that I am drinking several days a week, in fact, the majority of days a week. Anybody relate? I‚Äôve texted my psychiatrist about this new habit starting ever since I got the news about my father a week ago, but I haven‚Äôt heard back.\nONE THING I can give myself credit for is that I am actually literally measuring the amount I drink so I can be as precise as possible, because when I drink, I usually have a tendency to go insanely overboard or simply abstain 100% of the time. This is the first time I have been drinking in the ‚ÄúGreyzone ‚Äú!",

        "Text": "My partner has been struggling with my mental health ever since we didn't know I had a mental health issue. To be quite honest, I think he exacerbated my symptoms (not on purpose). Not blaming him, my actions during mania certainly didn't help.\n\nIt started with fights over the dishes and the fact that I laid around basically all day until I went to work. It's almost laughable that we used to fight over the state of the house back then because compared to now it was a dream of cleanliness. \n\nOver time the dishes got worse and so did the other messes. More fights were had and I started to become irritable for seemingly no reason which he took personally and never believed me when I said I didn't know why I was irritable. \n\nWe got a house and it was always a mess. Then my cat got run over by a car and I scooped her off the road and slept with her body in the garage. After that I was essentially non-functional. I wasn't eating. I was always sleeping. I let my other cat shit and piss all over the floor outside the litter box without cleaning it. I basically lived on the couch for a month without moving (my partner was away for work during this time). \n\nAfter that we had to move and I was no help. Packing was exhausting. Living was exhausting. In our new place there were more flights over the state of the house. I was sleeping a minimum of 15 hours a day. Things were NOT good. \n\nWhen I say \"fights\" I mean screaming and yelling hateful things at each other which eventually turned into me just sitting there crying, not taking, while he yelled at me.\n\nFinally I went to the Dr. they prescribed Wellbutrin and that helped but a year later I was still struggling so I saw a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with BP2. It took about two years for us to find the right med combo for me. During that two years it was nothing but fighting between us about the state of the house and my lack of taking care of myself and my depression and irritability. Also that I hadn't yet found a therapist. \n\nHe'd tell me that I wasn't getting better, only worse. Which was gut wrenching for me because I felt like I was improving. Not massively, but a little at a time. \n\nI've finally been in therapy for a year but during that year my marriage has fallen apart. I feel like my husband takes my BP2 personally. He has a bad habit of invalidating my feelings when I address issues with him which is unhelpful. I know that in order to feel appreciated and loved, he needs acts of service like keeping the house clean and the dishes done and cooking and I just don't think I'll ever be that person. Even at my best. \n\nI also make really poor decisions when I'm stressed, angry, depressed, manic...the particular episode dictates what the poor decision is. Overspending, burning bridges, poor sexual decisions, etc. which cause even more fighting. \n\nI've read the stats on the success rate of marriages when one person has BP. They're not great. Pile the stats on a marriage surviving infidelity (which we both committed however mine was far worse). Pile the stats on a marriage that is long distance 50% of the time and I'm just feeling hopeless. Especially since my husband won't go to couples counseling OR individual therapy.\n\nI'm also diagnosed with ADHD and my therapist has suggested looking into OCD as a possible diagnoses with my psychiatrist. \n\nJust hoping I'm not the only one with a fugged up marriage but also hoping I am because I don't wish this on anybody else.

My depression lifted, I went back to school and finished my bachelor's, got involved in a couple of volunteer roles, life was good. However, it was killing my word recall and just made me feel dumb like my brain had less processing power.\n\nNow that I'm off it, my memory has started to come back to me and I can have more tabs open in my brain again, but I'm at an emotional low that I haven't been at in years. I haven't done any laundry in weeks, have been going several days without bathing or brushing my teeth, don't wanna exercise and have to work hard to convince myself just to do some basic squats and jumping jacks.

Perhaps it was when I came screaming into the world two weeks and two pounds early. Perhaps it was last July, last August, last September. Last year, last month, yesterday into tomorrow. Time becomes merely theoretical in the face of an illness; a suggestion. I cannot pinpoint exactly when, as the great Sufi poet Hafiz wrote, \"Someone Untied My Camel\". \n\n\n\n\nThis I do know, it was my birthday, and Thanksgiving, and the first time meeting my lover's parents while grieving my own. I became aware, awake in the slicing wind of a cold snap, that something was terribly, awfully wrong. A flood of chemicals plummetted me into my own hell, from which I continue to emerge, and relapse, and emerge again.\n\n\n\n\nIn the gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when the world became a snow globe, speckled with light and color, I lost complete control of my mind as I understood it. Every waking moment contained a soaring high and a devastating low. \n\n\n\nNot working, I paced the corners of a yet familiar apartment, like a zoo animal does when the last of the wild in them disappears. I parted my fingers to peek out of blinds, feeling as though someone I did not know, someone who had the gravest intentions to harm me, would stroll down the sidewalk with a cut up smile. The world became a fishbowl as I stared out of the peephole for hours, laying in wait for that phantom. I painted my eyes with makeup long expired, smeared into a mess like an abstract oil painting on my face, and painted again. Dishes grew colonies of mold in the sink like moss on stones. ",

I‚Äôm very scared of ‚Äúno therapy‚Äù for the first time in 6 years BUT somehow I feel excited too.\n\nHere‚Äôs a lil snapshot of my journey:\n\n* Age 12: Diagnosed w/ chronic treatment-resistant depression + active SI and self harm\n* Age 19-21, hypomanic episodes start‚Ä¶\n* Age 21, first manic episode. My motto was ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to be miserable the rest of my life, I might as well have fun.‚Äù I almost ruined my life.\n* Age 22: Therapist sent me to be re-evaluated. Got diagnosed Bipolar II. Went to rehab which changed my life\n* Age 22, my Dad dies, conveniently right after my insurance cut off lol. I relapse, spiral, cue too much alcohol and coke, cue sexual assault and rape, cue attempt&plan, cue urgent need of new of therapist. \n* Age 22: Weekly to biweekly therapy for 1.5 years, monthly for another year, and bimonthly to quarterly after. Got an ok psychiatrist.\n* Age 26: Same therapist, but new psychiatrist as my last one didn‚Äôt have enough insight or ability to educate to my liking. Lamictal/Wellbutrin/Prozac are my SAVIORS now. Since then, I‚Äôve been solid. \n* Age 27 (now): Stable on meds, stable career path, living in my own apartment, have a dog now, car fully paid off, making a dent in some CC debt, in a very healthy relationship, clean from drugs, properly grieved my Dad, go to the gym, do my laundry biweekly, sometimes I cook‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs crazy. And I‚Äôm lowkey graduating from therapy.\n\nMy advice?\nTake your meds!! Daily!! And get refills on time!! And if you think your meds don‚Äôt work, legit don‚Äôt stop until you find a good psychiatrist. And get sleep, a lot of sleep. But not too much sleep. And try to have a routine. Move your body and stretch. And be kind to yourself. Most importantly‚Ä¶ forgive yourself ‚ô°. I had to forgive myself before I really started to heal.

I felt very sad like in a emotionally painful way if that makes any sense, lots of dissociation/derealization, tired all the time, no energy, no motivation, isolation, no appetite, emotional numbness, a lot of self harm, I wouldn‚Äôt shower for 2 weeks, basically didn‚Äôt maintain hygiene, suicidal ideation and thought, guilt, shame. Suddenly about id say 2 weeks ago randomly it kind of just stopped and I was out of the dissociative state and didn‚Äôt feel sad anymore. I was eating again I had so many ideas for some reason, i literally wanted to buy everything (I‚Äôve already spent like $50 and I‚Äôm unemployed), I‚Äôve not been getting the best sleep, I only got 4 hours the other night, 5 2 nights ago, because I was not tired at all and was busy searching the web for things to buy lol. Eating snacks in bed at 230am when I have to get up at 7. Suddenly really into pop musics from the 2010s for some reason spent an hour vibinf to it while dancing in the mirror at midnight. (My pupils also seemed to appear bigger and shinier but this might be irrelevant) I basically thought I was the best looking person ever lol starting at my self . In the morning not tired surprisingly besides when I was doing math lol. My slow sad playlist is too calm for me now whilst before it was all I could handle. I‚Äôve been more social than usual and  c talking more to my family than usual (it‚Äôs weird because I tell myself I don‚Äôt want to talk to them too much to not seem annoying yet I end up doing it anyway) Yet despite me not exactly feeling depressed in this moment, I wouldn‚Äôt say it feels like happiness per se. It more feels like I‚Äôm on my toes doing all these things but at the same time exhausted if that makes any sense? I‚Äôm confused I thought I was depressed considering that‚Äôs how I felt for months but now suddenly this is happening but it‚Äôs not necessarily happiness so I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm mentally ok I‚Äôm so lost and honestly feel terrible knowing that I really don‚Äôt have control of these moods I feel like I‚Äôm on a ride that never stops. I really struggle with self harm when I feel that depressive state (my arm is covered in scars) a month ago when I was feeling this way I was literally using a box cutter in inanimate objects just to cope and stay clean (although I relapsed many many times during this time) I was having a very very hard time not relapsing. I spent many nights conversing with 988 and other hotlines. And now, boom. I don‚Äôt even think about any of that stuff. Seeing sharp objects has no appeal to me whilst before I was going crazy over it. And these states, have absolutely no reason. Nothing is happening in my life at all to cause these feelings. These mood switches  has happened before. It‚Äôs been happening for about a year actually but the depressive states happened for 2 years and progressed. I‚Äôll be depressed for many months and then get a few weeks a month tops of feeling this elevated state then spiraling right back into depressive state coming back worse each time. The depressive states get so bad to the point I‚Äôm actually scared for my safety. The voices in my head tell me to basically hurt and kill myself. But now I‚Äôm elevated again. I‚Äôm actually so confused and I don‚Äôt know my self anymore. I can‚Äôt control my mood states and I feel so helpless. 16 btw.

Anecdotal perspective however, perhaps.\n\n  \nThis trainwreck of a disaster began about 5 years ago with a sweet, long hypomania making me abit loose with the ol. canon for a while and then it all went south, Diagnosed in '21 with BP2, possible PTSD from ye ole shitty childhood and as it happens, also severed ADHD.  \nNow, all of these one their own isn't too bad, and truth be told together they can be managed with some good help and medications, however i have a gene thing that gives SSRI the finger. Fluoxetine worked but made me almost shit my pantaloons once or twice a day,\n\nLamictal was a disaster, i gave nothing and took the only thing have going for me, which is my wits. Valproate did nothing.  \nLithium works to an extent, but my tolerance stops at .8, therapeutic starts at .6. Severe lethargy and all sorts of shitt. And it needs antidepressant in addition, which turns out I‚Äôm immune to one way or another. It got so bad my lithium fluctuated due to me almost shitting my pantaloons twice a day, they came out almost whole. MAO inhibitors and tricyclic are off the table on account of everything turning out to be a damn disaster.  \nSleep is and issue, going on... ohh i don't know but like 25 years except for the few times i'm really stable, which is once a decade or so. Meds for sleeping? turns out it fuck with my QT interval triggering restlessness and a whole fuckton of torture, as if someone is sitting somewhere with a voodoo doll commanding my limbs exactly as i'm transitioning into sleep. I swear, all of anti-psychotics, zopiclone, antihistamines the whole fucking lots. even good o'l tiddies size huge every night didn't work, didn't even make a dent bois, it's a lost cause, i know.\n\nNow i'm obviously in quite the predicament and should get my psychiatrist involved, however he's indisposed for bout' 4 weeks now, a regular ol' physician is doing what she can but she was really uncomfortable for understandable reasons. I'm getting the damn pump checked out, i know nothing about ECG and can tell that doesn't look right. Can't wait to find out what drugs they have that won't work for that!\n\nAduvanz works quite well for a lot of things actually, calms me down as nights sets in even, however it worsen anxiety so, well stupidly risky.\n\n  \nSo here i sit being held hostage by my own physiology that need healing not getting any peace nor sleep to facilitate said healing.  \nThe pressure in the chest, the awful feeling in my limbs and the suffocating darkness spewing hate for everything i feel i did right yet ended up with the short stick time after time.\n\n  \nI mean, it never ends. Yet society expects bravery, go get err' attitude and most of all existence so they can enjoy us and avoid having to attend our damn funeral. Or so i'm told, the fuck if i'm going to endure this fucking hell for much longer to please the crowd who only gives a shit postmortem and wish they had done things differently in the past. If our horses in the past, or our pets in modern life show symptoms of heavy suffering which can't be treated, we do the humane thing no questions asked. I on the other hand are still on the torture bench surrounded by smiles and awkwardness.\n\nBeing brave and strong, getting the pats on the back once in a blue moon and the occasional \"how are you\" to which anything else that \"fine, how bout' you\" causes awkwardness and a sense of urgency to get out of the situation. Especially here in Norway, stupid fuck ask how you are, even how you are feeling. Unless you outright lie you get the stink eye, every time.\n\n  \nAny one of these days the anxiety, hopelessness and hate waves will combine and bring forth relief, hopefully i can go home, across the rainbow bridge and join all the bipolar fucks who didn't make it feast in relief until eternity.\n\n  \nHoly fuck i'm hurting.\n\n¬†",

I switched from Tegretol to Taver 200 mg and then to Lamictal 200 mg, taking one in the morning and one at night, mainly due to availability issues at the pharmacy. \n\nFrom the start of my diagnosis, I took it seriously and followed my psychiatrist's advice, going to bed at exactly 10:30 PM like clockwork for about two years. I‚Äôm a night owl, and now I usually sleep around midnight. I have never missed a day of my medication. \n\nFor context, I studied psychology and have done extensive research since my diagnosis,  never been in therapy. \n\nIn conclusion, am I special, lucky, or is this the result of my discipline? I ask because I've noticed many people with bipolar disorder take a lot of medication.\n",

        "Text": "Hi all, I‚Äôm new to Reddit and also this recent diagnosis. I had my first depressive episode at 16, triggered by heartache. Lasted months and then picked up the drink and was in active addiction for 17 years. I have over five years sober now. I don‚Äôt remember swings or changes that were drastic other than depression that was severe and the episodes happened at 16, 22, 30ish, and 35 at my bottom. I do relate to the symptoms of more energy and wanting to do everything, I always looked at it like I was trying to ‚Äúmake up for the lost time‚Äù I was depressed. I always used sleep as escape, and alcohol and drugs. I watched my father change at age 53, never to be the same again and had all the mania and depressive episodes and symptoms of BP1. They started out spaced out by years and began peaking and falling quicker and quicker. I baker acted my father, saw the empty eyes and his smell change. I watched him degrade because he was incorrectly diagnosed and addicted to sleep meds. I got sober in 2019 and he took his life in 2022. I managed to stay sober through that, and after working my program and five years in the middle of AA, I am ready to look into this. My life looks like this, and has for a long time: I get a good week and a bad week. Good weeks, I feel energetic, can workout and run and get to meetings and work and meet people and feel happy and joyous, filled with awe and gratitude. I talk fast and am witty and fun to be around. I have it ‚Äútogether ‚Äú and people love to ask my opinions or have spiritual talks. I have faith and a great outlook on my life. Bad weeks: I wake up one day (nothing happened the day before, it was a great day), and I cannot open my eyes or get out of bed. I‚Äôm exhausted and feel like taking on a simple task is too much. I sleep all day and then crawl out of bed. Eat garbage and try to sleep, with trouble. If I‚Äôm lucky I get a few days of this, if I‚Äôm not, the longest was two weeks. This was after my dad committed suicide. My thoughts get darker with each day, I get further into my ‚Äúhole‚Äù and want to start separating myself from everyone. I am filled with shame and guilt. I hate myself and get why everyone hates me too. There is no love. After dad, grief and trauma were mixed in, and I got a diagnosis of clinical depression. I was on lexapro only at that time. And now I‚Äôm realizing that when I didn‚Äôt take it, I kind of liked how I felt. I got more energy, like over caffeinated, I could run miles and not sleep that much and didn‚Äôt eat much food, so I lost weight. It was better than the blah I felt. Wellbutrin was added in, low dose and I felt hopeful again, and for a little bit I was ok. I honestly did feel and do feel more mentally and emotionally stable, kind of unaffected and unbothered and content most days. My program has given me tools to stay aware of the mind, and spirituality and meditation are Huge part of my life. But the holes and crashes kept happening. It got better, a few days in the hole or one. My ‚Äúnormal‚Äù days were great, I just felt grateful to have one. But there‚Äôs no warning, I go to sleep and wake up and cannot move and sleep becomes paramount to anything. I recently was let go from my job because of my inconsistency with attendance, I flake on people and friends I‚Äôm supposed to see. I book things on the good days and then can‚Äôt show up, and I hate myself. I‚Äôm in a new relationship and although he‚Äôs so supportive, I crashed a weekend I was supposed to travel with him, and didn‚Äôt go. So it is affecting my life and always has been, I just think I‚Äôm ready to see it. Does this sound like BP? The depressive thoughts usually come after the action of crashing. \nMy psych just prescribed my depakote and I‚Äôm reading that it‚Äôs targeted more for mania, which makes me nervous since I‚Äôm prone to these crashes. Or am I hypomanic and this mood stabilizer will even it out? \nI‚Äôm early in this journey but in a way, desperate for a diagnosis and solution. I live my life free of substances and free of the obsession to use, but I‚Äôm trapped by this. I got sober to be free, and I feel so grateful to be this close, where my father didn‚Äôt get the help he needed. I am choosing different and so open and ready. Any insight or experience is greatly appreciated. ",

My brother in law mentioned that his friend has always had feelings for me so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what caused the change for me. But why??\nI want to be happy and I know I could be with him. He has no idea of how I feel and I don‚Äôt intend to tell him until i figure out what the f*** is going on. Anyone else experience this? Is this a bpd or bp2 thing? Am I doomed?",

I pay my credit card bills from past reckless financial decisions and things I want/non essentials but other than that I rely on my mom for food/housing\n\nToday I quit my ‚Äúpart time‚Äù job, in the past I haven‚Äôt been able to last at any job I‚Äôve had longer than 6-8 months, this one lasting only 3. I was overworked and extremely burnt out, and just couldn‚Äôt make myself go through all the emotions and stuff I deal with there. There was so much, I was scheduled way more hours than I signed up too, customers are absolutely vile, I realized I realllly suck at setting boundaries and don‚Äôt know how to stand up for myself in a ‚Äúcustomer service appropriate way‚Äù Anyways, the past few weeks I have been stuck on the idea of actually working for myself (ceramics//art stuff) I have always dreamed of this and known in my heart I am meant to be artist. I have never stopped creating things, but have gone in waves of selling some things at art markets/custom work that friends/family commission me for. It feels like life or death to me when I think of the future, if I have to work some stupid ass job forever I know things won‚Äôt end well for future me. I feel the need to start the process to make the future I want a reality now and the timing is right for it, I couldn‚Äôt do this if I was going to keep giving all my energy to that place. \nSo yes I did quit today literally over text with no warning bc that‚Äôs my style, I love a clean cut yet make myself so guilty for choosing me. I was worried about telling my BF (still new - like 3 months) and was anxious all day, I didn‚Äôt even text him. But he called me :) I told him and he‚Äôs the sweetest as always / let me know I don‚Äôt need to be anxious about telling him anything. i was worried because we have talked before about how I will need to figure out what I will do in the future for money besides the job I had/he knew it was gonna be temporary. I also talked to my mom about quitting before I did, which I have never done in the past. I was really worried about letting them down. \n\nI bought a kiln a few weeks ago, well someone in my family did for me and I‚Äôm doing a payment plan/loan without terms I guess. I am so beyond excited for this because I finally will have access to a resource I need to make my plans come together. I hoping it will be here in time for me to figure it out and maybe make some things to bring to a Christmas market this year. \n\nSo I have somewhat of a plan put together, but am going to be without income for a while..\n\nAny advice on early stages of creating your own brand/business? And how to regulate/work with everything we deal with? How do you make a living to support yourself/conform to the standards companies want? I don‚Äôt ever want to work for someone else again, but I‚Äôve said that many times before. I really don‚Äôt even know what to ask, anything I might need to hear? ",

I managed to turn the threesome into a poly relationship, ending up in California by Christmas with my ‚Äúnew partner‚Äù. Looking back this was extremely out of character because ive been nearly obsessive jealous and insecure our entire 5 year relationship. My fianc√© (im so incredibly grateful for him) stuck through it with me, I went through an extreme mixed episode in Jan-March; broke up with both partners and moved back into my parents house two years after moving out. \n\nMarch to June/July I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. July I start sleeping less again, august was my birthday. Weird shit started popping up for me, spiritual journeys, thinking people online were bots, seeing shadow people in the corner of my eye in a different part of the house. You can take a look at my post history to get a vibe of what I‚Äôm talking about. \n\nI complain about my brain never shutting up, I‚Äôve had ‚Äúconversations‚Äù with myself. Another voice that‚Äôs me, observing my actions and criticizing myself, a younger me that I‚Äôve talked with twice, usually though it just feels like several trains of consciousness running across each other at the same time. \n\nI had an extreme break from reality one night when I was 14/15 after an involuntary hospitalization and being pulled out of school. Convinced my family and friends were nurses and doctors and I didn‚Äôt actually get released but that I was hallucinating being at home. It only happened for a few hours that night and I dismissed it as extreme stress. \n\nI was on MDD treatment as a teenager with just SSRIs and held a job for two years + friends. I stopped taking my medicine and started smoking weed at 17 and moved out. I stopped counseling, I haven‚Äôt held a job for longer than eight weeks since then. \n\nMy PCP said the episode from the year before and extreme depression sounded like BD and gave me medicine to start weaning myself onto slowly. I have a counseling appointment next month.  \n\nI feel alone lost and confused. I don‚Äôt have any friends, the ones I miss are long gone and would laugh in my face if I messaged them today. ",

The first med I tried was lithium, but I didn't like how I felt on that one, so I went with lamotragine, and im in love with it. I switched to a different psychiatrist, and I ended up adding an atypical antipsychotic. The first one was latuda and I didn't like that, so I ended up trying an antidepressant (again), and that didn't do anything (shocker). Then I decided to try it again and this time it wasn't too bad but it just made me tired all the time. So now I'm on Abilify and have been on it for about a week. I had some bad anxiety the other day, and my psychiatrist told me about buspar. If that's a route, we wanted to go down. I didn't add it, but if my anxiety gets worse (because I'm still getting used to abilify), then I might end up adding it.\n\nI am currently taking:\nlamotragine 200mg\ntrazodone 100\nabilify 5mg\nedit) buspar 7.5mg *starting half for a few days then going full dose*\n\nMy thing is, I'm not used to being on so many medications (it doesn't seem like a lot, but I don't typically take medications like I'm doing now). \n\nHow do you get used to taking so many for one mental illness? Well, not one, but you know what I mean. \n\nAlso, I turn 26 in less than a month, and it just feels weird to be on so many with the possibility of getting on more at my age.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading if you read this far. I had to vent because I just had an appointment with my psychiatrist, lol\n\nedit: I have now been prescribed buspar. I start it today, but the past few days, I've been getting less than 3 hours of sleep. I'm not sure if this is mania or not because I have been on abilify for a few days now (a full pill instead of half of the starting dose). there have been other symptoms of mania, but I really don't want to call it that yet.

I mostly experience dysphoric hypomania, but also pure hypomania and depressive episodes (which have improved greatly since I significantly limited my alcohol use. I'm a recovering alcoholic.) Currently taking 300mg Seroquel at night it usually works great at keeping me stable and comfortable, however there is often a persistent presence of anxiety that presents itself as general worry and uncomfortable anticipation of things where I constantly worry about life in general/future events (my parents dying for example, even though that's not even an issue atm), and how I may perform... socially, at doing my job, etc.  I'm assuming this form of anxiety is more related to GAD and not BP2 because I experience it when I'm stable.\n\nI have found some relief from this form of anxiety with both Pregabalin/Lyrica as well as lower (25-50 mg) dosages of Seroquel. My question is about how the Seroquel is working here. My understanding is that people who are prescribed SQ off-label for \"anxiety\" and insomnia in low dosages (under 50 mg), are benefiting from the antihistamine effects specifically. But what about in my situation where I'm taking a maintenance dose of SQ as well as a PRN dose? Is the PRN dose acting on histamine receptors or does it move on to serotonin and dopamine action? Just trying to understand what's going on here. (I do/will talk to my Dr. about all this. He gives me a lot of freedom to find what works for me, in a safe way.)",

Let me tell you, I want to run back to my abilify so fast after the last two weeks on this shit. Not only do I get restless leg syndrome every single night while trying to go to bed but I also have my anxiety levels to the max. To point where the past few days I've felt like I can barely breathe but short shallow breaths. Yea my depression is under the radar but everything else is RAMPED UP. Like I mean I am PISSED at just existing in this time in space. I feel out of body. Just not right. Anyone else have any problems with latuda? ",

Especially my mom and my sister like my sister was diagnosed with severe anxiety and was also medicated for it. She also works in a mental health clinic and my mom is very supportive of that. However, I physically cannot open up to them. I can never see myself telling them about my condition partially because I‚Äôm angry about them not noticing my symptoms and noticing but not doing anything to intervene. It‚Äôs hard to navigate without the support of your family or them not knowing about your condition where they see your symptoms as just your personality and not a sickness. My lows are low, but it‚Äôs functioning depression. But sometimes it gets even lower where I don‚Äôt leave my room or bed for days. My family doesn‚Äôt question it. Some part of me wants to yell at them for not noticing that somethings wrong instead of ignoring it or getting mad at me for not having energy to do anything.\n\nI cannot open up to them like that is not an option for me.

If I am like my old self before I was diagnosed for BP2, it is because several triggers took place in a row; increased social activity, reconnect with old friends, saying goodbye to a longtime friend, which I think reminded me that life could be over today.  So live.  PLUS, I no longer hate myself.  Once you truly love yourself, anytime is possible!",

My social circle revolved around my son and married friends. These friendships went away either because now I am a single man or because they ended up siding with my ex. I dated someone for a year, and it was great. However, it was a rocky relationship and was not sustainable in the end. My bp2 got worse, and I was causing too much pain to this person. Now, the loneliness is real. It is consuming. I am not even talking about dating but making friends. I am working on myself. Whenever I reach out to chat with someone, I feel like a creep. I have hobbies, but people are always hesitant to have conversations. How do you connect and make friends at this stage with bp2?",

And I wanted to stop it from other symptoms like restlessness and the possibility of infertility (I didn‚Äôt know all these side effects in the hospital) and the needing to eat to take it. So my doctor said to take the last 4 pils I had left 40mg each for the next 4 days. It wasn‚Äôt so bad until I was out. He did not taper me and I have had this tension headache ever since. It‚Äôs been two weeks sometimes it‚Äôs not so bad and other times it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs better in the morning. A week or so ago he put me back on he did recommend 40mg but I chose to do 20mg twice a day not wanting to get on a high dosage for no reason. Well that didn‚Äôt work so I upped it to 40mg twice a day. And still I‚Äôm having this headache. It seemed to have been nearly gone and I smoked weed again which I was doing throughout the withdrawal process which I now realize didn‚Äôt help. It came back and hasn‚Äôt left even though I been taking my medication and not smoking weed for two days now. Yesterday marked two week mark. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else experiencing this or have or knows someone who has? I went to the ER they did a CT scan and an MRI and said they found nothing they believe to be contributing to the headaches and pressure. I‚Äôm really scared and don‚Äôt know how to stop the headaches. Someone responded to me before said they experienced this and that taking the medication is what takes it away in a few hours. But it‚Äôs been days I take the medication pretty much on time but not exactly everytime. I‚Äôm only off by a half hour to a hour. Please anyone with any information please tell me.",

I like the community on here.\n\nI‚Äôve always been an anxious person. As I have grown older, I have reflected back and realised I was such an anxious child. There were so many signs that I wish an adult recognized so I could‚Äôve learnt strategies back then. For example: \n- in grade 1, everyday I had anxiety about my teacher closing the classroom door. As soon as it closed, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was so bad I would hover around the door most days and try to distract her if she tried to close it.\n- i had so much anxiety about water usage. It was around a time in Australia when there was a drought, and I would feel so panicked when I saw kids leave the tap open. I was convinced we would run out of water. \n- I had anxiety about the 2012 end of world prediction from about 2008. I would think about it every so often and just panic and cry. The week leading up to it was torture.\n- I quit every sport / extra curricular activity I did if I had any sort of pain etc because I was so fixated on that pain and worried that it would get worse.\n- I quit singing lessons because the feeling of breathlessness made me spiral. \n\nWhen I graduated high school, my mental health deteriorated between the age of 18-22. But I did a lot of traveling, even studied abroad on my own. I think I didn‚Äôt value my life as much, so I wasn‚Äôt as scared. \n\nI also work in a very stressful job environment, so my anxiety has been pretty full on the last two years. This time last year, I had two severe panic attacks at work in the same week (both times an ambulance was called, and I was taken to the hospital). \n\nI also have developed flight anxiety, which I never had. I used to love flying, I found it so peaceful. But last year when I travelled overseas for the first time since 2020, I convinced myself that I was going to die in a plane crash. I sat on about 5 flights during that trip, and every time we landed I thought ‚Äòit‚Äôs going to be the next one‚Äô. I spent two hours one day googling the airline to see if any crashes had happened, and how safe the planes were‚Ä¶ \n\nA recent one - the other day, my partner was asleep. I came to bed and there was a smell in my bedroom very briefly that I couldn‚Äôt explain. It could have been anything, the window was open! I suddenly convinced myself that there was a carbon monoxide leak and for one hour I was tossing and turning and was checking if my partner was breathing. I tried to battle falling asleep because I felt like I wouldn‚Äôt wake up.\n\nAs I‚Äôve gotten older it‚Äôs just gotten so much worse.\n\nHow‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs anxiety going? When I talk to my psychiatrist about these things I always ask if it‚Äôs my anxiety disorder or bipolar. I think there are things I do that I have always thought are just anxiety symptoms\n\nIdk ü§Ø I think I should show this so my psychologist this week haha",

I‚Äôve started seeing a psychiatrist, initially for an assessment of ADD, but since I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for the past six months, she asked a lot about my depression and how I've been feeling. She then suggested that I might have bipolar type 2. After reading a lot about it and talking to her about myself and my experiences, I can partly recognize myself in it, but at the same time, I‚Äôm really unsure about my memory. I‚Äôm having a hard time remembering if these possibly hypomanic episodes were real or if I was just normally happy.\n\nLooking back, there are some periods that stand out, which I actually remember as extremely good and happy times. The first was a three-week period when I was doing volunteer work abroad, and I was incredibly happy with my life every single day. Everything seemed more beautiful and brighter, I really remember the colors and the feeling of the wind, and I felt like I was truly happy and had found meaning in life. But that could also have been a combination of being away from daily life, etc. But the thing about this experience was that I booked it super spontaneous like on a friday and then left sunday out of the blue. Which is a bit out of character for me when I think back. And when I came back I was again very depressed.\n\nAnother more recent period was this spring/summer when I felt that everything was good again. I had many more plans, worked more, learned to play two instruments, had a feeling of being high, and as if there was a greater meaning to it all. I spent money I didn‚Äôt have, but not on things that were completely out of character. The same applies to creativity‚ÄîI‚Äôm very creative and love learning new things in that area, but during this period, I was just doing it a lot more and listening to tons of podcasts about all sorts of interesting topics. Afterwards, I fell back into a more depressive state, where it fluctuates a bit, whether I feel okay or really bad.\n\nI'm just a little confused by all of this, and I can definitely recognize some things. I can 100% see myself in the depressive part, but I have a hard time seeing if the hypomanic part fits me, as many of the things I did were things I wanted to do anyway, and maybe I just felt better and therefore had more energy for them. So, I‚Äôm writing to hear about other people‚Äôs experiences with hypomania and whether what I‚Äôm describing seems a bit mild compared to what others experience? thank you in advance from a shy confused soul<3",

I‚Äôm a caregiver for dementia patients, and as I was getting them dressed I realized I couldn‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. Like I thought I was someone else. Then the hallucinations started. I started seeing faces in the walls and hearing people laughing at me. I had a massive panic attack a few hours later and started screaming that I‚Äôd seen the devil and needed an exorcism. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know where that came from, as I‚Äôm a devout Jew and I‚Äôve never believed in the devil in my life.\n\nSo I call my psychiatrist. They seemed pretty mad that I was prescribed Wellbutrin and told me to go to the ER immediately. I went to the ER, they gave me lots of Vistril to counter the effects, took my labs, and sent me home. Today I am at home, but I‚Äôm very tired from the whole thing and I‚Äôve been sleeping for the rest of the day.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt more serious, but it could‚Äôve been way worse. According to some online sources, this kind of reaction could cause seizures. Mostly, I‚Äôm super embarrassed and afraid to return to work. Thanks for reading that I know it‚Äôs super long.",

My husband just got his car hit for the second time this year (both not at fault). He is so sweet, he even waited to tell me until I got off work because he knew I had a stressful week.. he's had to deal with me at my worst and despite being properly medicated and quite stable the past few months, I'm not proud of how I reacted. \n\nHe was trying to be positive and that's what I love about him and he was scared i would be mad but I wasn't. I cried like a baby because his car crash earlier this year could have been fatal (several cars involved, result of uncleared debris on the road) and he drives so much for work that I'm constantly worried. Our area is known for shitty drivers. \n\nI totally made it about myself and stressed and shut down when I should have been more supportive and gave him a stress free, easy going night which is what a personality type like him needed\n\nI feel so selfish. I don't deserve someone as special and caring as him. And I continued it by constantly asking for reassurance \"do you still love me?\" When it's not about me, he's stressing about the situation. .\n\nWe're in this together but I do feel a bit selfish because I am angry that he never got full coverage yet could afford a bunch of camera equipment (for work). I blame myself for not covering the 1k they wanted up front. Now we're going to have to dip into our vanguard. \n\nAnyway, maybe I'm just a shitty bad person and shouldn't blame this disorder. ",

That said, my mood is level and I‚Äôm no longer depressed BUT my lifelong debilitating anxiety is the same. The ONLY thing that helps is .50mg Lorazepam and now, out of sheer desperation, in the last few days, I‚Äôve just started using it daily. I know all the warnings‚Ä¶it‚Äôs addicting, you can build tolerance, may cause dementia‚Ä¶but I have tried 35 different SSRI‚Äôs/SNRI‚Äôs plus TMS, buspirion, gabepentin, hydroxezine, serequel, propranolol, 4 years of therapy, exposure therapy, taking leaves of absence from work, and none of that has worked for the anxiety. I want to live my life! I want to be able to leave the house again without having panic. I‚Äôm just so over it. I think I‚Äôm to the point of accepting that I‚Äôll be dependent on Lorazepam so I can freaking live a normal life. I‚Äôm 48 years old and I‚Äôve missed out on 25 years!

I really don‚Äôt want to go back to one of the SSRI‚Äôs although I have heard low dose Lexapro paired with  Lamotrigine \"might help‚Äù but I tried Lexapro (on its own) many years ago and it pooped out quickly. I 100% can‚Äôt take SNRI‚Äôs‚Ä¶.they give me very bad SI. I‚Äôm just so desperate.\n\nEdit to add that I also take 300mg Lithium along with 125mg Lamotrigine and .50 Lorazepam as needed (at this point it's daily) ",

They can‚Äôt make money on a magnesium supplement so I guess their M.O. is obvious. \n\nIt also regulates blood pressure and heart rhythm, so if you have issues with that it could be a bonus for you. \n\nPlease comment your experience with mg if you have some, and any questions if you are considering trying it!!\n\n",

        "Text": "So basically I‚Äôve always believed that I was making my manic and depressive episodes up for attention and I‚Äôm not bipolar and it‚Äôs actually borderline and I‚Äôm making it all up for attention. Also my ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù and swings are rapid cycling and extremely intense sometimes. My first episode I believed I was god and wrote a robot constitution to the United States and plotted the robot overthrowing of the government, but I‚Äôm almost certain in my mind I was making this up for attention, before that I was put on prozac(ssri) which they say caused the mania, my first manic episode before that when I was also on Prozac I thought I was gonna be the best musician ever, played guitar 12 hours a day (had just started) and spent about 2k on guitar pedals. This was 3 years ago, as the year went on I was off and on lithium, abilify, but I keep stop taking them because I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm bipolar and the meds make me so goddam numb it makes me extremely suicidal. Fast forward 3 years to today and constant episodes, psychotic, manic, depressive, psychosis, mostly drug induced because I was a cocaine and alochol and benzo addict for awhile. I reached a point and quit all drugs, I‚Äôve been sober for about 9 months now and also started abilify for my mood when I quit drugs exactly 9 months ago. The same thing occurred it started out amazing, I was stable, I was so happy for medication I thought it was saving my life and I had so so much hope and I was so sober. After these months passed about a month or so ago I started feeling slightly manic, very dampened and controllable and actually fun because of the meds, spent about 4k on leather jackets (what the actual fuck) and was overall very talkative and I convinced myself again that I was not bipolar and that I was on medication for no reason. The meds started making me extremely lethargic after this and made me so numb and apathetic I just wanted to die. So after this I get off medication because I believe I don‚Äôt need it and I wanted to prove to myself if I have an episode that I‚Äôm actually bipolar cuz I cannot for the life of me convince myself of that fact even tho my psychiatrist says I‚Äôm one of her highest risk bipolar patients and my therapist who has known me before my first episode says I‚Äôm extremely bipolar and need to be on medication. After I got off my meds I felt slightly hypo but ok I just wanted to do things I was very hypo so I broke up w my gf and then asked out my coworker the same day, not sure if thats something someone going through mania would do. I also had such an overwhelming appreciation for the world and everybody, this is also coupled with extreme anger and agitation and psychotic breakdown inbetween all the love I feel, couldnt sleep more than 1-4 hours a night aswell and also pulled multiple all nighters, after this I was not convinced I was bipolar I said in my mind I would be convinced if I crashed and actually had a depressive episode, and that happened I crashed extremely hard even though I was only hypo for about a week and a half and that feeling was insane. Complete switch, hated everyone at work, thought they all hated me, didn‚Äôt want to talk, stopped going to work, stayed in my bed for two days straight, didn‚Äôt want to do anything, and by that I mean watch tv, blink, eat, do drugs, move my arm, drink water, I didn‚Äôt want to goddam exist I hated myself, my life, I just wanted to sleep. I got an ADA for work and have been out of work for the passed week just not able to get out of bed, except for one time my brother came to help me because he‚Äôs my rock and gave me a hug and we watched a movie and I felt some sense of relief, I also had klonopin prescribed for the psychotic ness and was able to feel relief and at least ‚Äúok‚Äù because of that, so am I actually bipolar if I was able to feel ‚Äúok‚Äù and relieved when my brother came, he made me feel so ok, not good or loved because it‚Äôs impossible for me to feel that, but he provided relief for a second which is why I‚Äôm questing my bipolar again. Also when I‚Äôm having so much major depression my eating disorder gets so bad , I can‚Äôt stop intentionally making myself puke up my food because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve it. Fast forward to today, I wake up without my phone charged and it won‚Äôt charge, this sends me into the most massive unhinged psychotic rage I could possibly feel, I wasn‚Äôt thinking anything I was just going batshit insane, after this I just wanted to die and sleep which is making me think I‚Äôm becoming mixed, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and started to feel this ball in my stomach that I still feel right now. It‚Äôs a ball of absolute unhinged emergy that feels like it can‚Äôt be released it feels like I‚Äôm coming up on 80mg of adderall but it‚Äôs a ball in my stomach and I feel so anxious, music sounds SO good which is one of the biggest indicators I‚Äôm manic and I just went and bought 100$ worth of crystals for no reason and also I‚Äôm typing this out and I never ever feel the need to talk to people or type out things or even text when I‚Äôm not manic, I feel so mixed I hate myself I hate myself I don‚Äôt feel any hope but I feel so much energy, like it‚Äôs coursing through my veins I can feel it, I wanna do so much and talk so much but I can‚Äôt release. So I‚Äôm assuming this mixed will turn full blown hypo and then, then I think I‚Äôll be properly convinced I‚Äôm bipolar, actually if this turns hypo and then I crash from hypo then I‚Äôll actually be convinced. I can‚Äôt remeber anything. It‚Äôs hard remembering my episodes or anything since I was diagnosed and they accidentally gave me those ssri. But I‚Äôm really losing it right now I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, someone please tell me it‚Äôs gonna be ok, I was only depressive for about a week which also makes me think I‚Äôm not bipolar because episodes should last longer. I‚Äôm rapid cycling so fast and idk where my mind is and I‚Äôm so scared. But I haven‚Äôt relapsed though, I‚Äôm still drug free, which I‚Äôm incredibly proud of. Someone just please read this and tell me if I‚Äôm bipolar or actually have something else. Someone please tell me what‚Äôs going on. Abilify doesn‚Äôt work. Risperdal makes me want to die so does lithium, lamotragine gave me hives. I‚Äôm so helpless. Do I have to be on meds? Because I really really really don‚Äôt want to be . I don‚Äôt know who I am I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm so sorry someone please tell me what I should do. Thank you so much if you read this, I know it‚Äôs such a rant I love you all.",

I've had stressful last few weeks (heck years probably by now). I felt my new meds kept me mostly stably last month (good but not manic moods), even though I had a few panic episodes or overstimulation just 2 weeks back. I visited my therapist last wednesday morning. He was pleasantly  surprised how I bounced back, as I was a totally different person during my 'overstimulation' just 1-2 week prior (I was also at clinic for that).\n\nAfter that appointment I went to daycare (I'm receiving disability benefits). That was fun, but as the hours progressed everything started to feel dull and boring. Make computer do this&that with this program code? Yeah, never done it but I know how it should work, so I wrote ABCXYZ: and it's done.\n\nI'm only at this daycore for 2 weeks now. I haven't met many people.. but the more I met, the more I felt I could just pick out random traits or predict them.\n\nSo you also have the same model noise cancelling headphones? Cool, mine is also in blue.\n\nSo you also have trouble executive functioning around this/that? Yep been there\n\nYou also cannot stand this sensory issue? Me too\n\nSo you also have gender dysphoria? Me too, (well mostly if I'm manic that is)\n\netc.\n\nEverything seems too familiar. It was said to be a good thing for me (autistic people like structure after all).. but it more felt like everyone around me was someone assembled from a bag of random autistic traits, which you could just copy-paste from a bunch of online resources of autism symptoms. I've seen it before..\n\nSo I started googling and my first intuition was feelings of deja vu. But in hindsight not quite.. I don't recall seeing a particular thing before.. I think it feels more like derealization, but maybe the opposite or something? Or am I lacking the words/scenarios to describe something as feeling fake? Because it's more like everything feels clear, predictable but that makes it extremely dull and uninteresting.\n\nI turned some music later that night and YT recommended me: Any Given Day & Annisokay - H.A.T.E. The song lyrics go like:\n\n>A split sense of myself  \nI feel like somebody else  \nIt‚Äôs both heaven and hell  \nI‚Äôm breaking, I‚Äôm breaking away\n\n>My mind is at war  \nA battle for my soul  \nI‚Äôm free, but lost you know  \nThere‚Äôs no way out, no way to go  \nI am the hate  \nI am the fear  \nI am the voice that you can't hear  \nI am the end that's always near\n\nThe song felt like a completely \"general purpose\" metalcore song. Harsh vocals during verses, clean energetic chorus, and the typical metalcore breakdowns and guitar tune. The lyrics are always subjective how to interpret them I guess, but it felt exactly like how this \"clear view\" felt so weird to my usual me. Also much stronger than I ever had before.\n\nI also felt extremely autistic at this moment. I got the same fish'n'chips as I always do.. the same crisps and instant soups, from the same brand as always, and having the same night routine as always. This energy continued with other YT videos. My recommendation feed was full of shit I already watched, and when something \"new\" showed up, I was stepping through the videos just to learn \"seen it, done it, been there\". UGH!\n\nSo now on thursday. Slept real bad so woke up with migraine. And very melancholic mood. A tiny inconvenience would make me burst in tears. Unable to mask any of my autism traits. I took an eletriptan to fix my migraine, which I know fucks with serotonin levels, so not really keen on taking them. My migraine disappeared, but I felt very tired. I've weekly attacks. The week before I also took eletriptan, and I basically didn't sleep at all the next night.\n\nFriday and today just continued more like this. I cooked the same curry soup as I always do, same ingredient list and recipe.. it tastes good, I have the energy to do it, but I'm also bored.  I only slept 4 hours last night. I can feel very anxious, restless and quickly at unease. I didn't feel fine driving at home tonight.. traffic rage, people in fast cars that jump lights, etc. You can see them from miles away, and I must resist the temptation to block them to \"punish\" them for driving like a lunatic. All it does is put myself in danger and become a lunatic too.\n\nThis subjective clarity kind of feels 'great', the dullness combined with restlessness is not.. I think I will grab some Seroquel to turn my head off, and maybe ask my doc to up my daily dose on Depakine (on it for \\~1 month, but I spoke with her last monday to stay at only 300mg/day for now).\n\nI know this is a long post.. but does anyone recognize their selves in this story?",

My energy is better, my irrationality is MUCH lower, and overall I just feel SO much more stable it's kinda eerie.\nAlso curious, is there a honeymoon phase in meds? My symptoms have been fairly mild my whole life (enough for me to seek help, but not severe enough I even thought bipolar was a possibility before I was diagnosed), so perhaps a low dose is enough? \nIdk, how has meds been for you?",

For the past couple months I've not been feeling right but it has gotten significantly worse in the last couple weeks. Thing is that my head and body feel like I've gone low but I'm still able to force myself to 'function'.... like everything is going on inside my head/body but I'm able to 'present' to people like I'm my usual self (like I can go to work, and put on the facade that I'm working but I don't actually get anything else done kind of thing). \n\nSo I guess my question is... is it possible to mask through an episode?\n\nLike every feeling, sensation and thought is going go to bed and don't move or do anything at all ever (which is a typical low feeling for me). But I've got a lot of unavoidable things going on atm so I feel like I can't do that, so I'm using medications, redbull, diazepam and nicotine etc to just maintain the image that I'm fine when I'm really not. But I think using all them and carrying on like everything is fine is understandably not helping and I'm noticing that I'm feeling even worse, can't relax or switch off my brain at all ever and my thoughts and behaviours are getting more concerning for me.\n\nI've spoken to my doctors and stuff and they say that it's just 'environmental stressors' that everyone has to deal with but I'm getting more scared of my thoughts so I don't know what else to do.\n\nSo I don't know if this is like extreme anxiety, a potential episode or start of an episode, or literally just stress everyone goes through and I just need to find better coping mechanisms. But I feel alone; literally being anywhere but my bed gives me a killer headache, makes me feel physically sick and just so uncomfortable like there's things under my skin and I need to get them out. I don't know if knowing what this is would help in anyway when most of the time the things you do to make you 'feel better' are the same. But my team just keep saying like have a cup of tea or go for a walk and I'm like the idea of that makes me feel like I'm actually going to be sick and I have tried but that just means I'm alone with my head so it's not a refreshing break it's just an opportunity for things to spiral further.\n\nSo I'm also out of ideas of what to try if anyone has any that have actually helped them in the past because there's \"nothing else\" the doctors can do and I can't keep feeling like this.\n\n\n(I know it's stupid but just someone actually listening, hearing, understanding and then going yeah you're blowing this out of proportion it's just stress/anxiety try this that or the other or even like yeah that sounds like a start of an episode do the exact same thing as above somehow I think would help dunno why but I can't seem to be able to do the stuff without the reason it's a really annoying mental block)\n\nThanks in advance x",

I'm a recently diagnosed and confused newbye on this sub here and, I don't know a lot of stuff yet, so I'm sorry, this will be a long post, and I don't know if it's appropriate, I'm actually ashamed to ask for advice about this tbh, but... I don't know anymore\n\nMe (27M) and my girlfriend (26F) had known each other for 10 years, and we have been a couple for the last 4. Coincidentally, in that time I started to question even more a lot of things about my life and my many family issues, and after 2 therapist and a bunch of confusing, draining, and difficult situations, I finally got some answers in the shape of a very confusing, draining and difficult diagnosis. I have ADHD, for years I thought I was on the spectrum and, maybe had some ptsd from something that happened when I was a kid, but, I'm not in the spectrum\n\nBut anyway, we both have a lot of issues, and  hers always seem to be bigger than mine. I don't wanna get into details, but, she's going through some very difficult stuff, and before any other thing, truth is, she's the most supportive and loving person I have ever met, I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have gone to therapy, nor would I have started to put some limits with my family and started to do so many things like my new job if it wasn't for her. But it's always been hard for me to talk about my issues in a comfortable way with her, not only because I know she has a lot on her plate, but also, because I never had someone before to talk about this. Specially, I grew up hearing daily how my issues troubled or annoyed everyone, how I was responsible for some people leaving, or getting sick, so with someone I care so much about, this gets harder\n\nShe knows I'm bipolar, and she supported and comforted me enormously during the diagnosis and all the... grief I felt, but this diagnosis also happened to coincide with probably the biggest challenge in her life, and it only snowballed into something bigger that 2 and a half months later, things look just as f'ed up as in the beginning\n\nI'm tired, I'm still grieving, (yes, I know that might not be the appropriate word or term, I'm truly sorry), and I'm going through a thousand different thoughts at the same time, dealing with old and new situations under a new light, and it's so overwhelming that I just want to cry, and kick, and scream. And I know it would be better if I could talk to someone, and besides my therapist, she's the only person I trust, but with everything going on, it feels selfish on my part to even try to talk to her about this.\n\n\nCurrently I'm in week 1 of a depressive episode after having a short hipomanic one, I'm 1 month i to my new job, which started great, but now I can't for the life of me do okey enough, I'm having a lot of thoughts about my relationship with my 2 male role models growing up, one of which is responsible for the traumatic event of my childhood, I'm being overwhelmed at work, I feel behind in life, I feel like wasted potential, and I'm truly asking myself who am I?

        "Text": "I got diagnosed as bipolar 2 officially last Friday. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Honestly I feel a little relieved which seems weird but my therapist doesn't think it's weird. He compared it to when you're physically sick at the Drs and they tell you nothing is wrong. How you WANT there to be something wrong rather than being told you're fine. Anyway I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and I've wanted to post recently multiple times but my thoughts are everywhere and I almost don't even have any questions I just want to share and hear from like minded. \n\nI've been feeling hypo lately. The past 4-5 days I've woken up around 4 am with the feeling of \" I'm ready to start my day\" tonight I'm up late because I couldn't stop thinking about putting up my Christmas tree. So I put it up. It's 1 am now lol and Christmas is here. Lmao. My husband mentioned earlier, are you manic right now, you seem manic. My thoughts race and earlier I went to CVS to get a stress ball and just wanted to blast music and continue driving just for fun and I usually hate driving. \n\nBut anyway I'm blabbing. I was diagnosed with depression in the past and was on Abilify and Wellbutrin for years. I got taken off Abilify and switched to rexulti and Wellbutrin recently by my former psych and I think that's what hypo started for the first time. My new psych and therapist are thinking that the abilify prevented any hypomania over the years and switching to rexulti while still on a high dose of Wellbutrin may have caused the hypo. Along with other factors like high stress levels. But yeah, was out on 150 of lithium and 25 lamictal for now and I've been taking that almost a week now and will continue my other meds till I'm up enough on the new stuff then stop taking the old pills. Btw does  lithium make you sleepy? I started just taking all my pills at night cause I was so sleepy at work when I took them in the am. \n\nSorry for so much blabbing. Here's a non needed but beautiful picture of the tree I just spent hours putting up. ‚ù§Ô∏è ",

Got any tricks or tips for that end-of-the-line mindset where you are full on sui-sui? Something that has worked for you before in stopping you or at the very least distracting you long enough for things to pass?\n\nPlease do not read this as \"I need uplifting positivity and/or support\".

        "Text": "I‚Äôm seeing some posts in here saying ‚Äúam I happy or is this hypomania?‚Äù And they‚Äôre resonating so much with me because I‚Äôve been asking myself all day. This week was the best week ever. Why? I had so much fun at work. I didn‚Äôt want the work to end each day. My job is a WFH marketing job. While some aspects are fun and rewarding at times, this week was not that. I just had so much focus, loved the mundane admin work, talking with colleagues, telling them how inspired I was in the work. Last week was the complete opposite. The past couple months I‚Äôve experienced burnout and even told my therapist 2 weeks ago that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care about my job or the work. They can fire me and I‚Äôd be happy.‚Äù Prior to this week, I was chasing the clock hoping for 5pm. I missed deadlines. I didn‚Äôt want to get on calls with people. I dreaded everything I did. This feeling started in August and continued up until this week. I thought something with my focus was turning around and I had ‚Äúbeaten burnout.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until a coworker asked me how I beat burnout that I realized I didn‚Äôt have an answer. I started looking back at my week realizing I‚Äôve barely slept this week. I‚Äôve been wide awake laying in bed every night thinking about great ideas, telling myself stories in my head, thinking of scenarios, and thinking about the next day and fearing I might revert back to my depressed self. Thanks to my oura ring, it was clear I was not sleeping this week. But it had no effect on work. I wasn‚Äôt tired at all. More energized if anything. Am I coming to a regulated not depressed phase, or is this hypomania?\n\nFor background, I‚Äôm not diagnosed bipolar 2. My therapist has mentioned bipolar 2 to me a couple times, but I didn‚Äôt want to explore a diagnosis because it scared me and the hypomania symptoms were less frequent. I still am afraid to bring this up again and being sent to a psychiatrist for official diagnosis. There is so much stigma on mental health, and I don‚Äôt need another thing to add to the list of chronic illnesses I have. Should I mention this to my therapist?",
