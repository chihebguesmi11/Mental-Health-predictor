It DID happen to me, it caused all kinds of trauma and grief and sorrow and loss and total deterioration of my physical, mental, and emotional health. To be conned, exploited, manipulated, deceived, used by a person you trusted, adored, thought was a good, honest human. Who lived a double life, who stole my last years of fertility. No, it didn't happen for me. \n\nIf you wouldn't say it to someone who tragically lost a child \"oh you're being a victim by not looking at this as this happened FOR you not TO you\" then don't say it to someone who was the unknowing victim of abuse and deceit.

        "Text": "I was having a particularly hard time in life a few years ago because my nex after a few years together suddenly (after speaking about the next step being marriage) said ‘I don’t feel excitement for you, I feel like we have nothing in common, there’s not much to you, I don’t see your personality, I want to feel newly in love’ \n\nAt the same time, I lost my apartment (it was a student apartment and because I graduated the landlord wouldn’t let me live there) \nMy apartment was my home away from home because I was living in another country from my family. It felt like I lost my safety. \n\nFor sometime I was staying with relatives, cause I couldn’t find  an apartment. Eventually they stopped wanting to have me there, which led me to taking an apartment I was unsure about. I moved in, and almost immediately found out that the area was very unsafe. People were trying to break in to the apartment complex, the postboxes were bent cause people were stealing post from others.\n\nAfter a mental breakdown I moved out, and took sick leave due to exhaustion. Moved to my parents again for two or three weeks. The plan was to come back to the country where my nex lived. \n\nWithin 2 weeks my best friend passed away suddenly in a car accident. I cannot describe how broken I was. It was the worst thing I ever experienced. It took me another 3 weeks to move back to the country where my nex was. Immediately the discussions of our relationship and how he doesn’t feel ‘newly in love’ (after 5 years together) and how I have no personality and he isn’t attracted to me started. He wouldn’t ever let me be upset about my best friend, he said sometimes people pass away and there’s no benefit being upset.\n\nSo. 3 weeks after my best friend passed away. My nex broke up with me. I was alone in a country and I needed support. \n\nInstead of any support, he went on dating another woman, for a year without admitting it to me. He wanted us to work on our relationship by ‘being friends first’ and anytime I asked him to just let me go… he started blaming me for not wanting to fix things.\n\nI could honestly write a book about him. He was the worst person ever. I just cannot believe how anyone could breakup with another person so soon after they lose their best friend or someone close to them…",

        "Text": "Hey everyone! So I've made a couple of posts on here before but I've reached a point where I have started realizing that I'm showing symptoms of Complex PTSD, 4 months after I was discarded by my Nex. I am 32/M and she was 30/F and I discovered/realized after we broke up that I had been in a abusive narcissistic relationship for 9 years. She was definitely a Covert Narcissist as I've done enough research into this now to know the difference, so much so that I feel like I have a masters degree in Narcissism now.  \n  \nI've been out of the relationship, and went no contact, for 4 months now, and now that I have gone through the original phase of the break up and have done a pretty good job of putting my life back together/building up my sense of self worth again, I've started noticing that there is a deeper issue that I was not expecting.   \n  \nMy body has started reacting to things in the strangest ways, it's like my body can't tell the difference between actual danger/threats and something safe/positive. I'm assuming that this is happening because my brain has been reprogrammed to think that anything that makes me happy, enthusiastic, passionate, or excited is going to result in something negative due to the constant phycological abuse I was receiving, so my body is turning those emotions into feelings of anxiety, doubt, stress, and general unhappiness. I'm noticing that if I'm in a situation that should be making me feel good and positive, I'm almost disassociating and disappearing into my mind, my body also has this like numb feeling like I'm don't feel anything at all, just blank. I'm also being hypervigilant and constantly being aware of sounds or people around me, like I'm constantly scanning for threats or something, even when I'm at home I'm noticing everything going on outside. \n\nThis is honestly starting to make me very unhappy as I am trying to form new relationships with people and enjoy my life again but it's like I've had some kind of mind virus downloaded into my brain that only allows me to feel like shit all the time and never enjoy anything. I've been struggling so hard with trusting people that I meet, and my mind starts making these scenarios of what could happen if I let them get too close so I'm shutting down from them, I'm not being vulnerable or open with them, I just let them talk and I don't give away too much information about myself, which is stopping me from forming any real connections with anyone. \n\nI honestly don't know how to fix this, I've been trying to do research on it but I've not found anything that's really helpful, I'm going to a Therapist and have been for a while now, I just feel like I've been locked into being how I was in that relationship and I can't get out of it.\n\nHas anyone been experiencing these things as well? Or if you've recovered from these things, can you help me out cus this seriously is a massive issue for me and I need help fixing it.",

I have been in a relationship for a little over two years, and I really think I am in a relationship with a narcissist. Our relationship actually started out pretty well. About 9 months into the relationship, we moved in together. This is when I really started to notice some controlling behavior....I had to wash the dishes a specific way, wash my hands a specific way, clean a certain way, go to bed and wake up at a certain time. I had to start composting and recycling. If I didn't do any of those items, it would cause really large arguments and disagreements. I was always told that he never felt seen or heard if I didn't do things his way. It was frustrating. Then, about 4-5 months later, they didn't like the location of the house, and started putting pressure on me to sell my house. It was a months long pressure campaign that I finally relented to do because I wanted him to be happy, and frankly, I was tired of arguing about it. If we don't do things the way he wants them done, it causes a huge disagreement. He tells me I can absolutely not work past regular work hours, but he regularly does. I feel like most aspects of my life are micromanaged. It's suffocating. When he says or does something that doesn't sit right with me and I vocalize that, somehow, he turns it around on me...he rarely takes ownership of any of the concerns I bring to his attention. It's incredibly invalidating. Am I crazy for thinking I'm in a relationship with a narcissist? Totally open to your thoughts :) ",

        "Text": "Spoiler Alert: No \n\nLong version I’ve been getting stalked & harassed by a narcissistic “forever alone” since 2019. \n\nI have told this NStalker over & over I’m not interested in him, he’s gotten my number against my wishes repeatedly, shown up at my old place thus necessitating a move, forced me & husband to get new emails, new socials, new everything repeatedly. \n\nI will admit my husband & I are very thoughtful people, it’s innate, we think a lot. We’re not “hey put the trash on curb” people, we’re “hey, the trash is getting collected in the morning & therefore it needs to be out on the curb while it’s light enough to see, prob by five because of the season” people. It’s not an attempt to over complicate, its just how our brains work. Being strategic is not a bad thing. My dad is like that, my husband is like that, I am like that. The thought process is automatic. It’s in-built into how we perceive things. \n\nWe both understand it might take a couple extra words to explain the entire plan. We are fine with that-don’t like it, don’t bug us. Trying to bother husband & me is a choice & frankly contacting us just to shriek you hate our personalities is stupid. \n\nNStalker is, shall we say, kind of a reactive person. So I’m trying to articulate to NStalker not only am I not interested in NStalker & we refuse to be NStalker’s friend because he’s annoying.\n\nThe whole time this absolute dumb ass is just raging at me he thinks he should be allowed to tell me how much to say for the rejection to count. Because an extra paragraph of “hell no, fuck no & shit no” seems to just break his little Nego into pieces. It’s stupid, obviously the answer is no it’s not going to stop being no, let alone because some forever alone maladjusted psycho whines he doesn’t like the way we communicate but keeps bothering us anyway. My husband sees all of this, hates NStalker & considers making NStalker screw himself with his own nasty behavior a semi-regular sport activity at this point. \n\nNStalker contacted me from over ONE HUNDRED accounts after I blocked him, messaging me, posting about me, attacking people who told him to stop because he can’t mentally process that trying to scare a married woman into having sex with NStalker because his personality has gorilla glued his v-card to him is not the same thing as a n actual harassment victim seeking support. My only goal is to make sure the authorities get NStalker to go away & leave me, my husband our family in peace. This narcissistic misogynistic walking abstinence device literally is tripping so hard on his own dumb crap he thinks the abuser ( NStalker) trying to scare the victim(s) (apparently me & my husband) is the same thing as me & my husband processing our weird friggin time trying to get the abuser (NStalker) to go away & stay away without interfering in us & our affairs. No. Not remotely the same thing anymore than sky diving & jumping off a building are both falling because both the harassment by NStalker toward us & us coping with the stupidity both involve talking. \n\nThis is abuse, not understanding &/or agreeing with my husband & my personalities is not an excuse to batter us & refuse to go away. A rejection from me & husband is a rejection when we say it is because they are OUR feelings & decisions. NStalker doesn’t get to decide he doesn’t have to stop if he doesn’t like how we talk. Loser.

        "Title": "The Hoarding Ways of the Narcissist: Why You Shouldn’t Help Them",
        "Upvotes": 17,
        "Text": "\nI hear self-aware narcissists on the internet say they don’t favor one type of supply over another. Dr Sam Vaknin has even made fun of the word “empath.” Check this out though. Someone at Harvard wrote an dissertation (that’s the research that leads to a PhD) on how a lot of empaths are persons with borderline personality disorder, and Dr Vaknin has plenty of lectures on how the narcissist and the borderline can “find each other in a crowd.”\n\nHmmmm 🤔\n\nDr Vaknin has also used the term “hoarder” in his lectures and I think it creates a very easy to understand analogy about the nature of the narcissist. Since I am Cluster C and a hoarder it really hits home for me. \n\nIf you’ve ever watched the show “Hoarders,” a pattern will quickly display. The hoarder is usually pretty resistant to the fact they are a hoarder. The have all these reasons their non usable item is still necessary. They are willing to cut off their relationships for it. By the time they make the show, they are facing severe consequences for collecting all those things. \n\nThat’s the same thing a narcissist does with its introjects. \n\nIf a hoarder notices their beloved items are missing they go bananas. 🍌 It’s usually anger at first, followed by sadness. In my opinion, anger is always preceded by sadness because anger is the frustration facet of sadness. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if the hoarder is black, white, fat, skinny, rich, poor…\n\nA hoarder is a hoarder. There are varying degrees, but the disorder has hallmarks and compulsions for the hoarder to keep things. \n\nThat’s why a hoarder needs counseling or the compulsion will be victorious. \n\nIt’s the same for a narcissist. Instead of hoarding items, a narcissist hoards narcissistic supply; or at least the idea they have a harem full of available supply. \n\nThe site of the hoarding is the narcissist’s spirit: the narcissist’s paracosm. \n\nJust like a hoarder eventually has more physical items than they can handle which results in material consequences, \n\nThe narcissists emotionally hoard introjects to its emotional detriment. \n\nThe borderline, the toxic codependent, and other people who are damaged are the narcissists favorite meals. \n\nWhy? \n\nHere we go. \n\nThe hoarder is really suffering from mental anguish. It could be loss, grief, or trauma. The objects the hoarder keeps fill that void and distract the hoarder from the facing reality. \n\nHoarders rarely have just the hoarding. Anxiety, depression, and other disorders or triggers allow the hoarder to interpret life events in a way that acts upon their propensity to hoard. \n\nThat’s why they’re typically pretty delusional about their status as a hoarder. \n\nDr Kerry McAvoy made a lecture about how there is no “tabula rasa.” She says the idea what we are born a blank slate and that trauma makes the narcissist ignores their genetic propensities. \n\nThere is limited but still compelling evidence that the voids in the prefrontal cortex that diminish the narcissist’s ability to empathize are heritable.\n\nWhen my grandmother died, she had a house full of clothes still with the tags on them. \n\nMy mother lives in a six bedroom house with at least ten closets. Every closet is packed to the brim with designer clothes, jewelry, and hats. Designer luggage, but never leaves the house. \n\nShould she see me donning any of these items, she will go ballistic, even though they will never be worn. \n\nI have the same compulsions to hoard. I have a therapist and I fight them. \n\nBut I’m still a hoarder. I am fighting genetics. I’m fighting my nature. \n\nSo too does the narcissist. \n\nThe narcissist whines about how “nobody understands them,” how “their exes are crazy,” and how “the world is out to get them.”\n\nIt’s a compulsion. \n\nThe narcissist has the compulsion a bait trap that is designed for the empath: whether they want to admit that or not. \n\nThe narcissist doesn’t even have to think about the fact that those statements will hook them a problem solver that will do their bidding. \n\nIt’s as natural as blinking for them. If they are breathing, they are still deceiving. \n\nThe narcissist knows when they talk about their abusive and neglect filled childhood, the whole, healed people will fade away. They’ll have their choice on turning these naive empaths and toxic codependents into flying monkeys and supply sources. \n\nPeople keep asking “why do they do this?” \n\nIt is mandatory. It’s a compulsion. \n\nThey create a delusional world due to a mixture of nature and nurture. \n\nFor the many who have wondered “how do I avoid a narcissist?”\n\nStart here. \n\nAnybody who starts laying booby traps like “I wish I had someone to do X, nobody loves me,”\n\nOr \n\n“I really need help doing XYZ because nobody in my life will help me,”\n\nMake sure you’re helping yourself first. Make sure you’re not taking the bait and making yourself a codependent. \n\nIf you don’t do it, they’ll find someone else that will. \n\nAs a matter of fact, you got discarded because you used to rush in to save the narcissist from the karma they were supposed to get and you stopped. You got tired. You lost potency. You started asking too many questions.\n\nI remember when my X got her car vandalized, \n\nShe acted like she didn’t know who did it. \n\nYeah, with the amount of people you have hurt in the past, I’m sure you don’t know *which past supply did it!*\n\nBut she’s so delusional, she legitimately sees herself as an innocent and good person who gets attacked by other people for no reason.\n\nIt’s just like how you and I look at a house full of crap and the hoarder is like “hey, I can still sit in this one chair…”\n\nEven though the house smells terrible and there is nowhere to move. \n\nIt’s the same thing. \n\nIf you put a hoarder into an empty house, they’ll start collecting things. \n\nWhen you leave the narcissist, whether you left them or they discarded you, \n\nIt’s just like when a hoarder notices their items they’ve invested in emotionally are gone. \n\nFirst denial, then anger, then sadness…\n\nUltimately that spot in the hoarders home will get refilled. \n\nAfter the narcissist takes its negative supply from you, \n\nAfter you cried your tears, keyed the narcissists car, and they got the supply from telling everyone you’re Looney Tunes, \n\nNow the narcissist has a hole. \n\nSo they set a new trap: \n\n“Help me, help me! My ex is crazy, isn’t (s)he? Yeah, you believe me! My X stole my X Box and a pair of fuzzy slippers!”\n\nAnd here YOU come running,\n\nTo get the narcissist some new slippers. \n\nAs you sit there playing Fortnite with the narcissist,\n\nYou’ve helped the narcissist get their nasty, filthy, trifling, rat infested emotional house \n\nSo full of emotional trash it should be condemned. \n\nA compulsion is something we who have personality disorders can work to manage. \n\nCan the narcissist change? No. It’s a personality disorder. \n\nI’m always hoarding, because I’m a hoarder. \n\nI know you want to keep asking “but why?”\n\nAt the end of this root cause analysis: the narcissist has a personality disorder which compels them to use and abuse other people.\n\nThe narcissist got to see how amazing you are, how loving you are, how beautiful you are, the scope of your talent and how drawn to others are to you. \n\nHow do I know? The narcissist gets with people with high levels of empathy that don’t understand good intentions don’t necessarily lead to good outcomes.\n\nInstead of responding with loving you, \n\nThey responded with wanting to use you and break you. \n\nTheir disorder compels them to run on narcissistic supply. \n\nThe disorder compels them to destroy anything good. \n\nWhy? \n\nTheir brain structure.\n\nIt’s a compulsion. \n\nThat’s the answer. \n\nSo don’t help them. \n\nIt’s a trap.",

I maintained class, poise, grace and composure even despite the temptation to fire back in the heat of the moment, I removed myself from the situation and started crying.\n\nAnd still, I had the good nature to get back in there with smudged eyeliner and mascara and try to make peace with his sister, who pretended everything was fine and hugged me, asking if I was okay after everything she'd said to me - with her parents right there. But of course I never got an apology and she acted like I was apologizing to her. I was just peacefully trying to let her know I came from a good place and was just trying to help.\n\nThen, their mother made a comment that was supposed to be \"reassuring\" me but I can't help questioning her intentions and wondering if she was actually trying to plant seeds of doubt in my mind.\n\nWhen I tried to tell my story online seeking comfort and support, it seems like people don't want to believe me and I \"must have done something to antagonize them\" when the narc tactics are right there, clear as day. I was attacked.... and it shouldn't be okay for my boyfriend's family to treat me like this.\n\nWhen they're nice, it's always when someone is watching or for appearances. But there have been enough microaggressions for me to get suspicious and I recognize this for what it is. Smoke and mirrors, strings being pulled, dogwhistling. They're master manipulators and know how to play other people to disguise what they're doing. I know the game all too well because I have narcissists in my family. His mom is a liar and she's covert. She told my mom, \"ohhh, we don't drink in our family!\" and her husband's a raging alcoholic. She has also lied to me and told me my boyfriend wasn't home when he was, and his phone died, and she wasn't going to tell him that I called. She also ruined my surprise birthday party for him, stole the cake I made for him, stole the birthday cake he got me and lied to both of us about what happened to it.\n\nAnd they claim to \"love me\" and I'm \"part of the family\" while I literally walk into suspicious scenes set up for me to find and react or question things, patronize me, accuse me of not trusting my boyfriend not to cheat - his sister SNAPPED at me \"MY BROTHER'S NOT CHEATING ON YOU, YOU'RE OVERREACTING, YOU NEED TO CHILL, YOU'RE MAKING THIS EAY BIGGER THAN IT HAS TO BE, YOU'RE KEEPING IT GOING BY ASKING QUESTIONS\", and I don't know where that comes from because I've never had that insecurity, doubling down. But this incident with his sister really triggered and hurt me.​ Now crazymaking and mischaracterizing me is in the mix. ​\n\nMy boyfriend's family seems to be a highly professional circus of narcissists.\n\nDo I have the right to be angry about the way I was treated?",

One thing I said was when we have arguments I never get to tell him what’s in my heart that he might not have the same horrible thoughts about me if I coud ever express to him what I actually feel in my heart. He twisted it around & started loudly telling me ‘what do you mean I don’t know you ! I kno you, I been knowing you for 15 yrs!’ And why were you talking about all these great things you do for me. Really ? Your talking about getting me a cup of coffee or saving food for me. What I said was when I do several “small” things for him.\nHe doesn’t seem to notice he just berates me for the one thing I forgot and it hurts ! Then he ask me to move out. Neither of us has anywhere to go. I could possibly move in with my ex (we are friends). It would be a process tho. A lot of stuff to move, give away, throw away. Just grab some clothes & go. It’s just not that easy. Im really lost. So lost\nAnd tell me why do I still love him ?? I read another comment of someone. They said, can’t remember exactly but if your dealing with a narcissist and you are trying to make them happy & you can’t, it’s debilitating. That’s me.",

        "Title": "Intimacy/ED issues with other women after 9 years of narcissistic abuse. Is this a PTSD response??",
        "Upvotes": 6,
        "Text": "Hey so this is pretty hard for me to talk about being a 32 year old man, but I've been having problems with not being able to gain or maintain an erection when being intimate with women I am meeting, which truly has never been an issue for me my whole life, even with my Nex. I was discarded by my Nex about 4 months ago, I spent that 4 months having to process and heal from what happened to me as I received the classic narcissistic devaluation and abuse prior to discard with no explanation or closure from her once I was discarded. Almost like the past 9 years meant nothing to her and I was just disposable, which is clearly true as that is how narcissists operate.   \n  \nAnyway, I found myself, after about 3 months, feeling like I had gone through the worst part of it and was beginning to feel like I had found myself again and was starting to really make progress with my own personal growth. A lot of doors have opened up for me, I've reconnected with old friends and made new ones, I've been getting back into my hobbies and things I enjoy doing, and I generally felt like I'd dealt with the abuse and rebuilt my sense of self worth.\n\nSo I started getting back out into the world and I've been meeting women again, I've had a few nights out where I've ended up bringing girls back to my place and even had a girl that I was seeing for a few weeks that I had a good connection with. Every time I get into bed with a girl and we are being intimate, it's like my body shuts down and I'm almost disconnecting from the situation. This is not due to a lack of attraction or desire for these women, I'm seriously attracted to each one of them and they are beautiful girls. I had a girl here on the weekend after a night out in town, she was seriously hot and was very interested in me and I in her, we started making out and ended going to my room, I focused on her mostly as I was a bit concerned this might happen and sure enough as soon as it got to that point my body just shut down and I couldn't get an erection. \n\nIt's almost like as soon as I get to that point, my body is going into some kind of shock, like I can't feel the excitement or feel anything really. I just feel kind of numb and disassociated from what is happening. The girl I was seeing for a few weeks, it happened the first time we spent the night together and I thought it was just because it was the first time I'd been with anyone since my Nex and after a few nights together the issue went away and I was able to actually have sex with her. But since then, it's been the same thing with these girls that have come home with me, and to be honest it's really fucking with my head as it's not something that I had expected to happen as a result of the abuse I was receiving. I don't know how to get past this, It's not like I can say this to people and expect them to understand.\n\nMy Nex spent the last year or so of the relationship, essentially creating this problem for me I think, by criticizing my sexual abilities (even though the 8 years before that she was very satisfied), or she would act like she was completely uninterested in me even though she was the one instigating the sex. She would also do this thing where she would wake up and get us both worked up and ready to go, then as soon as we would start having sex she would go ice cold, roll over, and go back to sleep, leaving me lying there confused and feeling like I had done something wrong. When I would talk to her about it she would gaslight me by saying that she was doing it in her sleep or she didn't remember etc. I began to have serious performance anxiety because of this, every time we went to have sex I was almost having a small panic attack, my heart rate would increase and I'd start getting tight chested and find it hard to breath some times. \n\nEven though I've gone through the healing process and went to Therapy before and after the break up for months, and felt like I had really moved forward from this , it's like she's implanted this thing in my brain that's still preventing me from having an intimate connection with anyone else. It's starting to make me very unhappy as I just want to be happy with someone else and enjoy my life again properly. Instead, I'm meeting these beautiful women who want to spend time with me and I'm not able to be intimate with them properly which is just causing me more hurt and I feel like I can't talk about this with them because I'm a Man and it's just a massive turn off and makes me look weak or something, which I'm not it's just my nervous system is responding to some trigger that I have no control over. \n\nBased on the fact that it took me a few nights with that girl I was seeing to be able to have sex properly, I'm assuming this is some kind of PTSD/Trust issue where I need to feel completely comfortable with someone before my body relaxes and stops going into this weird shock response and shutting me off from the situation. I actually don't know how to get past this or how to heal that part of me, it's like built into my subconscious or something and I have no control over it.  \n  \nHas anyone else experienced this as well? I really could do with some advice on how to heal from this properly because it's starting to become a serious issue for me and I feel like if I don't figure out how to fix this then it's going to continue for a long time.   \n  \nThanks for reading and yeah please, any advice you have for me is greatly appreciated.  \n\n",

        "Text": "Im in a relationship I just can’t seem to understand what is going on. I feel like my boyfriend is a narcissist but he called me a narcissist the other day. Im so confused what to do. He has these little quirky things that he’s started in the past few years, changes, not bad things but I’m trying to keep up with. Sometimes I forget & to him it’s the end of the world. Never cook anything unless it’s stainless steel, I tried to heat water in a pot that wasn’t. Holy Shit !\nDon’t store anything in plastic. Sumtimes I forget. Can’t I just remember to do or not do the things the way he likes ? He makes a HUGE deal out of it. But what makes it hard is I’ll do like 10 (small) nice things in a day. May I make u coffee, what would you like for supper, things like that. Then the one thing he bellows to me is “you kno I only eat organic ! This bell pepper isn’t !” It’s like that every day. He can never say anything nice to me. Then he says why can’t we just talk about this so I sit down, listen to him calmly. Complain about everything I do. The minute I open my mouth to defend or tell him something that HE does to hurt me. He goes back to the beginning of our relationship (15yrs) everything I’ve done wrong from then to now. Basically ruined his life. So I clam up again so he’ll stop yelling & blaming. Then he says again I don’t talk. I can do nothing then but look at him. Im the beginning I tried telling him 15 yrs ago has nothing to do with now. He doesn’t see it that way. He use to want go to bedroom (don’t know what’s ok to say here) & things were better for 1 day at least. Now immediately after, I do 1 small thing he doesn’t like he has no problem complaining. He blames everything on me. We almost broke up once long time ago. I cried & cried. Then HE said no babe don’t go anywhere. Then later told me I loved u so much I couldn’t let you go. Now he says that I wouldn’t go so he had nothing to do except tell me to stay.\nHe actually goes from 15 yrs bac each time we argue & think of everything I’ve done til now that has ruined his life. He even blames me because he quit his job after we’d been together 5 yrs. Now he hasn’t got a job & says he can’t get one while living with me. There are always 2 sides to every story but I swear when we argue I will say, I know I make mistakes but you do too ! He never acknowledges that. He makes me feel guilty about everything. Neither one of us can afford the apartment. I was just trying to co-exist. My way was just going with the flow not pointing out flaws or faults. He just can’t. Im lost. Does this sound like narcissistic behavior ? I’ve never really posted here but any advise or thought would be appreciated. ",

This narcissistic stalker has been sending me rape & death threats & keeps refusing to go away citing a fixation with me because I’m a sexual abuse victim. I love my husband, desperately, we both hate the NStalker, we’ve had to move, change numbers, change our contacts multiple times, we’re basically on the phone with some kind of help whether it be the police or digital forensics or the court every other day trying to get this narcissist who can’t seem to accept his crush on me isn’t mutual out of our lives. \n\nMy husband is the most amazing person I’ve ever known. He’s smart, he’s sharp, he’s tough, nothing phases the man, just nerves of steel. Everything the easily slighted, hyper emotional, childish NStalker isn’t. I have tried so hard in the past to explain to NStalker all NStalker’s incessant upset & emotions make me feel tired & unhappy. I find it so annoying & unpleasant listening to this covert narcissist (they are literally thought to be emotionally six years old & it shows on NStalker). \n\nMy husband does have low level ASPD, not enough he’s especially petty, he’s does have empathy for people he’s close to, his cognitive empathy & social awareness are off the charts. The room could be exploding around him & the man would keep it together. It’s just if somebody thinks they’re going to bully/manipulate him it’s like this switch goes off in his brain & he’s had it. That’s the only time you can tell he’s not 100% neurotypical. He’s puts it to good use for loved ones, it’s like his little super power if you’re mean to people he loves is the other person will just find their life upside down & he’s like “welp” 🤷‍♂️ “guess you were an asshole”. \n\nI think it’s fair in this case given NStalker did threaten to r*pe me & told me he wanted me dead & sent pictures of guns.  NStalker showed up at our old residence, he’d doxx anybody we befriended & he kept screeching & raging as he did all this creepy stuff. He doxxed out online friend’s kid at one point, he threatened to decapitate this little barely legal girl just for blocking him, he took another girl’s picture who had rejected him (also a girl with a boyfriend) & put her up on a site saying he wanted to rape her. After all that he still sits online claiming we were all mean & shallow to him & that he doesn’t understand why girls don’t want him. \n\nIts the most pathetic thing I’ve ever seen in my life, this NStalker. He is just obsessed with trying to be as violating as possible to as many women as possible, if he weren’t literally the size of a Yorkie I think he’d also try raping these women himself & not just targeting women who have already been raped by another person. \n\nWhat is the absolute fixation & obsession with rape victims & with trying to romantically attach himself to girls who don’t want NStalker? Most people would find getting caught pretending to be of interest to a taken &/or married woman humiliating. Why is NStalker so hyper sensitive to certain things that aren’t embarrassing but can’t see actually embarrassing situations as reputation destroying for NStalker? \n\nAnd why target people he’s out of his depth with like my husband who can cut through the crap so easily? My mother & father think NStalker is just a glutton for punishment. Is that part of the covert narcissism where NStalker deliberately puts himself in adverse situations just to play victim? Why does NStalker go out of his way to put himself in a bad situation for him? ",

        "Upvotes": 3,
        "Text": "In 2021, my (26F) years long abusive relationship with my parents escalated to a police visit. My mother (58F), who is emotionally unstable and both physically and verbally abusive, called the police on me saying I wouldn’t vacate her home. She victimized herself in front of the officers, saying I was threatening her and acting unstable because I was “off my meds”, aka ADHD medicine. She created this entire altercation and false narrative while my father was at work, convienently. I left her home and through a series of events ended up moving to Texas and living here for three years. It’s been wonderful and peaceful. \n\n\n\nPresently, I lost my well paying camera job this summer. Based on my career field being in marketing and media, a move back to California makes the most sense for job opportunities. Knowing this, my paternal grandfather (84M) was more than happy to offer me my old childhood bedroom at his home in California, 30 minutes away from where my parents and brother live. He’s already started repainting the room, replacing the carpet and basically making it livable for me to move into. He’s enlisted my father (60M) to help him get it ready. My lease at my current apartment in Texas ends in December, so everything is wrapping up nicely. Once I moved in with my grandpa, I planned on changing my number and going no contact with my parents unless they attended therapy, save for my brother. Grandpa refuses to charge me rent, so it would be my first time since becoming an adult to experience true stability and being able to save.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that worries me is my grandfather’s health. He’s been healthy and passing all his doctor’s visits with flying colors, up until two days ago, when he was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. He’s on the mend (thank goodness), but I’m worried that my attempts to explain my relationship with my parents hasn’t really sunken in with him. I cannot live with my parents. In any circumstance. I would (and have) rather live in a shelter. I’m afraid that if/when something happens to him, my mother will use the confusion as an opportunity to make me dependent on her again, or homeless out of spite. ‘Return to the fold’ or nothing. She’s abused and withheld basic necessities from me before. She’s turned off my cell service, intimidated other family members from helping me access reliable transportation, and has even used money to manipulate my decisions. Whatever is necessary to get her way. \n\n\n\nWhat I see happening in the very near future is her telling my dad to revoke my right to live at Grandpa’s house via my father, because they have access to my grandfather’s will, his bank accounts, and everything he needs to function daily. He plans on leaving a lot of his money and property to my father, as well as to me and my brother, with no mention of my mother. He’s aware of her poor character, but not the way I need him to be. He needs to be ALARMED without raising the alarm, essentially. \n\n\n\nI don’t know what legal rights I have?? Do I need to get something in writing from my grandpa when I make it there? How do I get a copy of his will when everyone is so touchy about the inheritance conversation? I’ve warned him a little bit about my parent’s behavior, but he doesn’t see them the way I do. With this health scare, I’m worried he never will. Any advice helps, honestly. Thank you for reading this far, I know it’s long.",

        "Text": "\nAfter almost five years with my bf after being long distance on and off, we’ve finally moved in together. Since we’ve lived together (4 months, 1 month of him away for work) these are the reasons I’m wondering: \n\n1. My family was going through hard times right when we were applying to apartments, and he told me “I’ll pay everything, just save your money.” When it was time to apply, a week later, he cashapped me half of the money towards everything, and never said anything about it. (Words don’t match actions)\n\n2. He’s never home and always “working” \n\n3. When he IS home he expects me to drop literally everything I’m doing to be in his face. I could be reading a book when he comes home, and he’ll turn the tv on and tell me “pay attention” as if I wasn’t doing anything. \n\n4. He hasn’t bought anything for the apartment. Everything in it is stuff I brought or bought while we’ve lived together. He uses all my things. When I buy something new, he just starts using it. \n\n5. He has absolutely no empathy. At all. Not just towards me. \n\n6. He’s extremely passive aggressive. In the beginning of our relationship I would ask him “Are you mad?” And he would say no, so I thought he was just a stoic guy. As time has gone on I realize that he throws silent tantrums. \n\n7. I made pretty good money, but recently had to leave my job due to health issues. He hasn’t asked me how I’m doing, offered any support, and even ASKED ME TO BUY HIM THINGS even though I was unemployed and told him I was stressed about money.\n\n8. He says I “bring emotion into everything” as if that’s a bad thing. (We were talking about child SA and I’m a survivor) \n\n9. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD & ADHD (I have other mental health diagnoses as well) and he has not asked me about my well being at all. \n\n10. I’ve been testing him by throwing out statements like “I’m so depressed” or “I’m really sad right now” and there will be no change of expression on his face and no response. Maybe a cold “it’ll get better. Keep your head up” \n\n11. He never apologizes. This is literally the only argument we’ve had over and over and over for 5 years. He can never take accountability, and takes everything as an attack on his character. \n\n12. His mother knows what I’m talking about when I told her he’s not considerate. Her words: “I don’t know why he’s like that because me and his father aren’t like that”\n\n13. He commands me to do things. I guess I thought it was how he spoke, but now I see he’s serious.\n\nAs I’m typing this out this all sounds so bad, but keep in mind we haven’t spent long stretches of time together before, so it was pretty easy for him to lovebomb me every time he’s sees me. Please help. It’s making me scared. ",

The hardest part is staying strong.. that means driving for a total of 10 hours at work in a tractor-trailer and hopping in the car and taking a 52 min drive one way when you know with the lack of communication it's going to be the same.",

Can anyone explain this? Why do this, other than intimidation!? He never hit me but he would do this and I found it really distressing.",

He always admitted it and owned it when we talked about it.",

My story is on my profile if you’re interested, it’s bad and traumatic. \nRegardless of all of the awful lies and treatment some moments stick out to me and make me question is he’s really a narcissist or just has tendencies?\n\nAn example: when we were together and things were fine he used to comfort me when i needed it. a few times when i had anxiety, he did thoughtful things like putting a fire place scene on the TV, playing calming music and just sat with me. THIS was so meaningful and i felt loved. But someone who would do this would also do the worst of it… it confuses me. \n\ntoward the end, he’s on and off block me during the break up. He blocked me one time and i reached out a different way to tell him a family member passed. He immediately unblocked my # called me and was so concerned making sure i was ok, despite having stonewalled me for weeks. \n\nAfter our FIRST breakup when i caught him in all of his lies, he genuinely admitted to me how messed up he was. he said things like “The truth it you dated a man who was insecure, hated himself and had no self esteem. I’m broken. You never deserved any of it. You’re perfect in my eyes.” And cried. it didn’t feel like playing the victim but more so accountability. of course i empathized and got deeper in the mess. \n\nIn all of these moments of care, were they ever real? Why would he do any of it if he didn’t have to? I believe he felt real things and just sabotaged it all. Part of me thinks he really is broken emotionally and mentally and just needed to be loved properly. But i did that, for too long and he still betrayed me. ",

I was expecting him to come visit me after he finished work but he insisted went home and when I asked if he was going to come see me his reply was “why? U need me” which I responded “no I don’t need you but it would be nice” he then just changed the subject after. \n\nWe both live in a country where we don’t have any close family or friends nearby so we only have each other and when I need his support the most he was nowhere to be seen.

I got really upset and crying and said it wasn’t true and he stopped going on. Another time the same thing happened but in the end I said I would never say that, you wouldn’t would you and he said he might do. I was stunned! Again we were being intimate at this point and I repeated what he had said and he denied saying it.\nAnother occasion I had some really nice lingerie on and he had been commenting about it then suddenly said ‘yuk that’s disgusting’ and accused me of having sperm in my underwear. I was in tears.  So distressed and upset. It wasn’t true, we hadn’t even done anything by then and all of a sudden he started kissing me out of nowhere.

I want to explain to them and the wife that it’s not OK, but not sure if safe to do.\n\nMy narc STBX demanded divorce 2 mths ago. She refuses to move out, i won’t move out because of our two daughters (19yo and 11yo). Obviously, I spend much more time (especially quality time) with my 11yo.\n\nYesterday, my wife got our daughter all excited about spending the day together, including going to a restaurant that the younger one was really curious about. It quickly turned out that the ”day together” for the narc means taking the daughter along for making couple of returns (overspending is a huge issue for the narc), and then having a lunch with her girlfriend where our daughter would just… take care of herself, i guess?\n\nMy daughter was heartbroken when she learned what will the day look like. She closed in her room. I went to talk to her, and obviously she said that she doesn’t want to spend the day with her moms friends. She told the same to her big sister.\n\nWhen we (myself and my older daughter) told passed the younger ones words, all hell broke loose. There was lots of blaming, accusations of brainwashing and crying. I took my daughters out and let them know that their moms behavior is unacceptable.\n\nNow, it’s the next day. The narc is behaving like nothing happened, and trying to chat casually with everyone. My daughter is obviously still heartbroken and disappointed, but plays along.\n\nI really want to confront my narc wife. I believe that my daughters have a right to feel angry and sad because of how someone treated them, and they deserve to hear apologies and acknowledging that what they felt was valid.\n\nI don’t know if it’s safe to do with a narc, and definitely if it’s safe to do with my children. I think that this might be hard, but it will be turned into a valuable experience for them.\n\nWhat would you do?",

        "Text": "Dear Abuser,\n\nI spent a little time thinking about whether or not that was you blasting my posts and I really thought to myself “nah she’s with her recycled supply. She couldn’t possibly have that much time to waste on little old me.”\n\nThen I went back and saw patterned activity on my posts. I noticed a post entitled “Dear Yolanda” that is very old with 24 shares. \n\nI meant every word of that, by the way. . \n\nI thought about how much the idea of you laughing at me and trying to take control of the narrative matters to me. Maybe a little bit. I made my love very clear not just in words but in actions and no amount of sending anyone I met my posts is going the change what you did to me. You did me extremely foul, grimey, and disrespectful for the majority of the relationship.  You displayed it very clearly at the end. I understand why you’d want to change people’s opinion of me.\n\nLetting me beat myself up for 3 days in a hotel while you cheat on me on our vacation because you can’t be honest and you wanted to make sure your recycleship was secure before actually dumping me speaks for itself. \n\nI know you’ve been told that, and I know you only care about how it looks. \n\nI know that you never cared about me and the evidence is how terribly you treated me. You did a great job proving the extent of your hatred and your jealousy. \n\nI know that every “I love you” was a performance to get more favors, more supply, more servitude. Thanks for admitting it, because it really does help. \n\nThe statement “our personalities don’t match” really screwed me up for a long time. Recently I had an epiphany, and I now understand what you mean.\n\nDuring our relationship I tried my best to never make you feel less than. I was careful not to belittle you or to be boastful.  I have never lived in any domicile with a window unit. I’ve never lived without air conditioning. I had never been to a laundromat. My mom was born in Chicago and lived there until she was in high school. I have plenty of family I visited there over the years. I never heard of Uncle Remus or Harold’s Chicken one time. There’s nothing wrong with it. Just two different worlds and I will never be back to visit yours. \n\nI’ve never lived anywhere with a bunch of industrial pollution before. I never lived in a house with rats or horseflies breeding in rat droppings. It was an extremely hard lifestyle and I did it out of love. I was extraordinarily uncomfortable. I didn’t tell any of my family in Chicago I was there because I was ashamed of how I was living.  I moved into your house to be with you. The house itself is terribly constructed with extremely shoddy craftsmanship. \n\nMore importantly, the level of conversation was mind numbing and extremely low bar. You and your friends spend a lot of time talking crap about other people or on conquest stories. I’m not sure how a bunch of 35-40 year old single people wondering where they can find a wo(man) can expected to give sound relationship advice. \n\nIf you had told me who you were up front, you never would have gotten close to me. You knew that and that’s why you omitted those details. Just as you omitted that you had a girlfriend our first few interactions. You’re always going to do what is of benefit to you in the short term, consequences be damned. \n\nIf you said when you told me about your recycled bust down that you had a 6 year open relationship where you “brought home girls every weekend,” you would never have been my girlfriend and you know that. I should have broke up with you when I found out but I was already addicted. You deceive people and as long as your short term needs are met you don’t care about the hurt you cause or the fallout.\n\nI was hooked because inherent in narcissistic abuse is intermittent reinforcement.  You probably look at your Xes as some testament to how great you are. No. The special kind of emotional abuse you inflict on your victims causes them to be hooked on you even though you’re a despicable, horrible human being. \n\nThat’s why you’re always in drama and fights. It’s not because you’re great, it’s because you’re a coward that starts and ends relationships with lies. You think you’re not a drama queen because you are quiet as you set off bombs. It’s called covert narcissism. Shy, vulnerable, collapsed, and unstable. Dramatic nonetheless. \n\nI heard the Streetwalker asking what you were eating. You couldn’t bring yourself to say I was cooking for you. That’s your usual lie of omission. It’s the covert narcissist’s modus operandi. That’s how I know she won’t be treated any better than I was. You wanted to hide it so I could blame myself indefinitely like the rest of your victims. The problem isn’t your recycleship. The problem is your personality disorder that’s untreated.\n\nThat’s why you could never say “this dinner is good.” You could never just say “you are beautiful.” In fact, when other people did, you act like it bothered you. You never could never say “your voice is beautiful.” All you did is criticize. You could never give me the win. It’s because envy is the root of narcissistic behavior. I was so busy telling you I think you’re beautiful that I never noticed you refused to say it back. \n\nThe only thing that is beautiful about you is my fantasy of who I thought you were. The make believe woman I fell in love with.\nYou want to paint a narrative of me depriving you when I offered you love and you simply didn’t want it. That’s okay, just tell the truth. \n\nIf you told me you let your girlfriends do your homework in college,\n\nIf you told me how terrible you treat your brothers and your mother, \n\nAnd everyone, IMHO,\n\nIf you had really painted an accurate portrait of yourself I would have known that our personalities don’t match and let myself out. \n\nBut then you wouldn’t have been able to go full narc and use me. \n\nSome of it is my fault. When you gave me that book entitled “Adult Children of Narcissistic Parents,” \n\nI thought you read it. I thought you were a reader.  \n\nAnd I thought you worked on yourself. \n\nI made an assumption.\n\nYour reading proficiency matches your handwriting and level of conversation.\n\nYour thirst for knowledge about yourself and the world around you (none) matches your spiritual maturity level (zero).\n\nSo as I think about you sharing my posts, opining with your “friends,” \n\nI think about how it was because of my best friend I even let you into my life. I figured that if she was cool with you, then you must be good people and I couldn’t have been more wrong in that assessment.\n\nSo to your Poorly Dressed Hypersexual Stud Club that has time to read all this: \n\nI’m honored that they even care enough to read it and I’m humbled.\n\nI know that I will be vindicated when your user nature resurfaces again. \n\nI know it won’t be long before you find a new supply that you think you’re in love with, and you’ll have to try extra hard to convince your entourage of dusties you know what love is. You’ll wrestle with it but your personality disorder is undefeated. Like you said, \n\n“you often do this.”\n\nJust like I saw you do when you told everyone you know “I’m madly in love with Marilyn we’re going to have a family,”\n\nThen start cheating on me right after.\n\nBut eventually,\n\nYou’re going to go full narc on your recycled sex worker, \n\nAnd because of her body dysmorphia, angry spells, and history of being traumatized,\n\nI feel so sorry for her. I feel so sorry that she doesn’t know you’re not capable of love. I’m sorry that while you were supposed to be lovebombing her you were still having sex with me. She didn’t even get a proper lovebomb because you were still kissing on me and inside me. Even though you “felt bad” you were never honest about it. More lies of omission.\n\nI’m sorry she’ll be used as an emotional insurance policy in between your other conquests even if you’re married. That’s really unfair for her but still better her than me. \n\nShe seems like an alright person who is reeling from damage, and you’re not going to do anything but continue to damage her then blame her for what you did like you’ve done to her and the other 100 women you’ve bulldozed.\n\nEven if you stop for a little while to preserve your precious image. \n\nThat day we went to that “Lovers and Friends” party and you told me you dated Porsha for 6 months, how you broke up with her, how “my person doesn’t do this and that,” \n\nI had just gotten an appraisal on my house that I was going to sell for us. My heart fell into my stomach because you were describing the very same behavior that I saw. I recognized our relationship was trending on that same trajectory and I knew that my fate would be the same. You told me right there you were going to make me suffer. I should have believed you. \n\nEspecially when you turned around and hugged up on some girl right in my face after I asked you set a boundary with your exes.\n\nIt’s just too many soul ties. Sex is an expression of love, not a video game to score points and conquests. You’ve gamified sex. That’s fucking disgusting and I don’t need that in my life. \n\nI want to tell you deranged studs something else: a man that is living his purpose is not chasing women. He’s chasing his purpose and fulfilling his mission. The women drawn to him are a byproduct of his success. He selects few women who compliment his purpose from the many. Success is not only elevating yourself, but having the ability to influence those around you to do the same.\n\nSo by chasing women so you can stomp on them and brag about how many of them you have done that to, \n\nHow good she looks as a measure of a greater conquest, \n\nGrown men with something to offer don’t behave like that. \n\nThe way you’re going about it is literally backwards and the opposite of the masculine conduct. Normal well adjusted men don’t behave like that. \n\nSo your “masc” is a lie based in negative inaccurate stereotypes and fuckery. \n\nMy solution to you telling me I meant nothing to you with your actions was to try to love harder, which was my mistake. I already knew based on your actions that you didn’t give a shit about me. Instead of crying about it and trying to figure out why I should have left. \n\nAt that point it became my fault for staying in that relationship when the evidence was right there.  Your background is built on scamming, cheating, academic dishonesty. Lies. Everything you have you got from using someone else, having someone else do all the hard parts for you so you could pretend like you ran the race at the finish line. \n\nWhen I think about you now I’m just grateful I didn’t sell my house like I planned. You’re not even worth one dollar of that equity in the house I worked for not using my body, but with my intellect. \n\nI’m glad your sycophantic tacky lesbian club has a bit of education on narcissism and narcissistic abuse,\n\nBecause eventually you won’t be able to hide who you are. \n\nSo go ahead and smear. \n\nIf they actually know you, I am 100% positive they already recognize you in what I’m saying. \n\nYou simps can chat about it all day as you eat Harold’s Chicken and shop at Oak Park Mall in your old ass lightly scuffed Jordans. That’s not my world, smear my ghost in that world all you like.  Fake masc, unearned achievements, and purposely misleading women is not a good life. Those parties are an atrocious cesspool of people that have already had sex with each others entire crew and I’m embarrassed to have even stepped my Alaïa shoe inside of one with you. It was completely nonsensical to even think someone that belongs to your world is my girlfriend and had any capacity for longevity or monogamy. \n\nIt’s called “Lovers and Friends,” I guess it’s right there in the title. \n\nNow I know. \n\nSo Smear away, narc. \n\nGet you a vice lord burger and have a gay ol’ time laughing with your “masc” crew. \n\nTalk about how many women of color you’ve crushed and devoured as a user and colonizer of women who are already under siege at the hands of their traumatic lives and society at large. Juxtapose that with your proximity to the oppressor. Discuss all the advantages you’ve had in life because you’re the surrogate of those at the lever of patriarchy itself while claiming to be against it and then go and use that power that has underwritten your life to destroy the lives of women of color. \n\nYou don’t “claim that side.” As a lesbian Christopher Columbus in some New Balances and a flannel shirt, your actions claim that side. No love is in you. You are ruthless, come to pillage, collect, take, use, exploit, gain from. Then you brag about what someone else did for you and flex the bounty you stole from your chattel. Take pride in your nature! \n\nMaybe next time you’re at Uncle Remus you’ll revert back into a crybully victim again and meet the “Sugar Mama that will pay off your student loans.” \n\nSurely that’s worth abandoning your relationship over if a trip to Paris is. \n\nIt’s all about what YOU can get. \n\nBeing the villain in your world where your behavior is acceptable is accepted. ✅ I want zero contact with you, your world, and everyone in that world. \n\nAs always, \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nLove Marilyn ❤️",

        "Text": "\nIt was November 3, 2023 when I finally got my X to admit she had reconnected with her recycled supply. When I look back on that version of myself, it makes me so sad. I was downtrodden. Reeling and scrambling from an emotional bludgeoning. \n\nMy X started to leave for the weekend to see her recycled supply, and I started to notice I was getting sick. She would come back and get in the bed with me. Sometimes she’d let out a “baby” or an “I love you” in her sleep. \n\nOne night after I had already been dumped for about two weeks, we had sex. I was surprised at how into it she was, but then she had already absolved herself of guilt by then leaving her free to use me as long as she could maintain the lie in her recycleship. We had went out on a few dates like she didn’t just cheat on me and embarrass the shit out of me. \n\nI’ve taken a lot of drugs in my life and I know how it feels to be high. I know how addictions feel. I started to see myself exhibiting the patterns of an addict. When she held me or hugged me I felt that rush in my brain, like I was shopping, gambling, popping downers. That’s when I knew that I needed help.\n\nI went to a few therapy sessions, and I described what I was feeling to my therapist. That was the first time I ever heard the term “covert narcissist.” Like many people, I had the incorrect perception of what a narcissist was created by pop culture: loud, arrogant, and vain. \n\nMy X is nothing like that, in fact the opposite of those things. I would describe her as quiet, deeply and visibly insecure. She’s not arrogant at all. Haughty if slighted, combative, icy, self important. But that’s not quite the same as arrogance. I think that’s more consistent with the grandiose subtype. She’s got more ignorance, myopia, lacking in self awareness. I saw her struggling with herself on day one and in fact that’s what made me more interested. \n\nI sought support from you guys. From r/narcissisticabuse, r/truenarcissiticabuse. You all taught me things about myself. Laughed and cried with me. Most importantly, I discovered other victims of covert narcissists that had the exact same experience as I did, down to the letter. \n\nI learned all the terms in the glossary of narcissistic abuse. I discovered that my X really likes triangulation. It worked really well on me. Every time she told me about something one of her Xes did I tried to top it: to a point. \n\nI cannot stand her best friend and it’s because her best friend is a liar. Her best friend doesn’t have her own identity or her own life. Her friend would randomly show up on our dates and nobody ever asked me if I wanted to see her. Everything she says is a derogatory story about someone else. It might be a celebrity or someone from their supremely fucked up world. Everything with her is so negative, I don’t want to be around it. \n\nI started to notice her best friend is a codependent. Broken. Extremely traumatized. It became apparent her friend was competing with me in the same way that I was with Xes past. She started buying the narcissistic more gifts. She started to write cards and letters because she knows that I’m a writer. I wrote my X beautiful words from my heart. Those of you who follow my work know how I use my pen. \n\nSo I asked the narcissist not to let her just pop up because I don’t like that heaux. \n\nIn hindsight I can see that she’s a secondary source of narcissistic supply and that’s why she’s uncomfortably close to the narcissist and the primary supply. \n\nAt the time I was made out to be the aggressor. \n\nPoor little covert has a mean girlfriend that doesn’t like the bestie. \n\nMy X is very good at using the drama triangle to her advantage. She’s really good at causing other people to fight around her as she quietly soaks up the supply. \n\nHer energy is negative and I was still holding on to a lot of her things. I’m a big believer in energy and I think her things were allowing me to hold on to the emotional vestiges of her toxicity. \n\nToday I decided to get rid of anything left that the narcissist gave me, any outfit or item that holds any memory or symbolism. \n\nI’m cluster C and I come from at least three generations of pack rats. I’m a self aware hoarder and I have to work against my compulsions to keep things. I give my clothes sentimental value and hold onto it forever. \n\nThis Paris scarf I found in a store on the Island of La Palma in the Canaries. At the time when I bought it I was so happy the narcissist chose me. I was so happy to take part in abusing and torturing her X. I was so comfortable in my own toxic ways. Looking back I am disgusted at my behavior and how I thought helping my X monkey branch was anything but vile.\n\nWhen I bought the scarf I was dreaming about my first date with the narcissist which was in Paris. I was wearing it around my neck when I had my first kiss with the narcissist. I bought it from a seamstress who worked on a Kimono of mine.\n\nI was wearing a brown dress when I saw my X in the CDG airport. I was so excited and horny that my natural flood waters soaked through the dress to put a wet spot on my butt. \n\nSo I took the scarf off my neck and put it around my waist.\n\nI thought it was a really cute moment and the narcissist told me she told her best friend that story. \n\nI was really upset about the narcissist’s oversharing with her codependent and I didn’t say anything. Looking back now I can see how I didn’t set boundaries and what the result of that was. I knew her bestie was too close then but I was so happy I didn’t want to rock the boat. \n\nRight before I went to the Canaries, I went out for drinks with my best friends wife who already knew the narcissist. She was telling me about how the narcissist has a girlfriend but both of them are mid as people and that I should keep moving forward with my life. She saw right through the narcissist on day 1 and she cautioned me against doing it at all. She said “don’t get stuck in the lesbian vortex with a mid bitch.” \n\nShe’s a doctor of physical therapy so I told her not to look down on her.  I told her she can’t expect everyone to be brainiacs with genius emotional quotients. I told her:\n\n “the way I’m feeling is so explosive that I can’t ignore it. I think there is some truth to what you’re saying, it feels like a Romeo and Juliet love which means it will likely end poorly. But I have to try it. I’m already in love with this girl.”\n\nAnd so, with full cognition that something was gravely wrong,\n\nWith a warning from someone that knew her, \n\nI acted on how I felt in the moment,\n\nThe same thing a narcissist does. \n\nOn Thanksgiving of last year, I was completely destroyed. The narcissist text me to ask her where her pants were so she could wear them on her date with her recycled supply. The part that makes me sad about now it is that she knew that she could ask me that. She was used to having her laundry done by me and she was still getting the maid service that is so precious to a narcissist because they genuinely believe they are above others and menial tasks. \n\nI was still very much trapped in the fog in some ways. But I told myself:\n\n*Im going to take my mattress, and I’m going to take my cat. The narcissist didn’t get any of my money, and I will heal my broken heart with my money.*\n\nAfter I moved out, the narcissist wouldn’t stop torturing me in text messages. I couldn’t bring myself to block her because I was still hoping I could get her back one day. I was still deep in the fog, blaming myself. The level of deference I gave her is disgusting and it hurts me so bad to look back at her kicking me while I’m down. The dominion and power I gave her over my life should only be held by God himself. The narcissist held a mirror up to my own brokenness.\n\nI began consuming content. I began learning about narcissistic abuse through listening to audiobooks: Dana Morningstar, Debbie Mirza, and AB Jamieson. \n\nThat did help some but not as much as the key the narcissist gave me in the fourth month. \n\nIn March, I went back to read every text I ignored. I went back through every text and picture she ever sent. \n\nI read a text that said “I wasn’t attracted to you, I spent the majority of time wishing you’d stop talking, I’d rather get my heart broken 100 times than be with you, you’re the last person on Earth I’d ever get back with.” \n\nMy therapist and all the people I care about have reassured me that narcissists lie, and she was upset that I moved out without telling her on my own terms. The experts say this was a power grab. \n\nI really don’t care what they call it. I call it the key 🔑. \n\nI never screamed at my X one time. I never talked greasy to her or about her. I used to call her my Goddess. My Sweetface. My lady. She wouldn’t ever respond to me trying to diffuse tension. She said “nice isn’t what I need when I’m angry.” I tried giving her space by going for walks and she said “I want you to stay inside and argue.” I tried my best. I gave it 100%. I moved 4 times in one year to be with her. I quit my job in Spain for her. When we had fights, I didn’t lash out on her or get angry. I just got depressed. I cried myself asleep, usually alone without her even caring or asking about my feelings. \n\nSo after giving all that, \n\nAfter pouring my heart and soul into her, \n\nAfter taking a corny, ignorant, intellectually inept mid poser to Paris as a first date, \n\nSitting on her emotional bombs, usually not responding, letting them detonate inside my spirit world, \n\nLetting her use my body, disrespect me, talk crazy to me and having said very little back, \n\nBe abandoned and cheated on….\n\nIf after all that your answer for your actions is it’s ‘because you hate me,’\n\nWhy am I in the fog?\n\nI had heard from Dr Sam Vaknin that “the narcissist is envious of you and the narcissist hates you, hates that they need you…”\n\nI was still in denial. I know what I did for her. I know how hard I loved her. She even said in the end “I know how much you love me.” So I never believed that the narcissist actually hated ME until that day. Her cruelty helped me to accept the reality of narcissism. \n\nAs we process this, our mind wants off ramps. The love in our hearts wants to believe the narcissist has exceptions to the disorder. \n\nThe disorder has rigid patterns and in the words of Sam Vaknin, “the algorithm plays out like clockwork.” Narcissists are all the same. By that I mean narcissism and the traits of the personality disorder are the same everywhere. Narcissists are not special and do not have exceptions. \n\nIt is unnatural to respond to love with aggression. That is THEIR sickness. It goes against the laws of nature to ask for love, be loved, and not only decline it, but be disgusted by it and fill up with hatred. \n\nCluster B are the only people on Earth that respond to love with hate. Malice. Evil. Outbursts they don’t understand. \n\nBut I understand.\n\nTheir brains don’t allow them to access empathy. They don’t care even if they want to because they cannot. \n\nShe was still asking me for passwords to brokerage accounts I set up for her after she dumped me, cheated on me, because she has a poverty mentality. I tried to gently help her elevate herself and she hated me for it. \n\nI was happy to give her the tools even after the fallout because it takes an education to actually be able to use them. Money and a fool will soon part ways. You have to have the ability to put your money to work to grow it. You have to pay attention to the market to manage your own portfolio. I want that for her. \n\nBut she refuses to work hard to learn anything, and that’s not the narcissism. That’s her.\n\nWhen we first met, I showed her who I was. When I talked about politics, science, culture, religion, trading derivatives, art, music, entrepreneurial ventures, the things that are important to me, \n\nShe acted like she was so interested! \n\nI noticed that she lost interest at some point. Instead of accepting that, I tried harder. I put my foot on the gas which angered her more. For so long I was baffled as why my increased effort was pissing her off. \n\nI told her I was “feeling melancholy” one day and she snapped on me.\n\n“Who talks like that?”\n\nPeople that know how to read? People with books in their house? \n\nCall me a snob for this, and I’ll be that for you. \n\nBut the two friends of mine she actually did meet: \n\nOne has a graduate degree in electrical engineering and the other has a PhD in psychology.\n\nShe had nothing to contribute to those conversations. \n\nAnd watching her be lost gives me a little insight now to why she hates me so much. \n\nEveryone in the narcissists world is an enabler and she hasn’t spent much time around people her narcissism can’t protect her fragile insides from. \n\nNarcissism is a trauma response designed to protect the narcissist from criticism, accountability, and anything that could be adversarial to their false self. \n\nSo basically, it protects them from real life. \n\nAnd since that day when I finally got my key🔑, \n\nI put the focus back on me. I discovered I was a codependent, I discovered my Dad is also a covert narcissist and that’s why I’m drawn to Cluster B. \n\nI began doing the hard work on myself to delve into what made the narcissist’s inner turmoil so attractive to me. \n\nI still think of my X as a work of art, as I always used to call her. \n\nShe presented me with a challenge so great that I fell in love with that. I got addicted to it. \n\nDo you know the feeling of running a marathon? Hearing Sofiane Pamart tickle his keys in Bordeaux? Integrating a function? Solving a problem and having a light bulb moment?  Seeing Megan Thee Stallion’s booty on a beach in Barcelona? The caviar from a sturgeon on top of a Kumamoto oyster chased with a little Champagne? \n\nIn the same awesome way, the level of toxicity, vitriol, hatred, ignorance, and envy beautifully painted on her like a Rembrandt or Monet, \n\nLike a fresh coat of paint on a car with no engine, \n\nThe conflict of a beautiful woman who is broken in ways beyond her own comprehension, \n\nWatching her spiritually oscillate between supply levels: \n\nIt disarmed all my defenses because I was in love with this gorgeous disaster. \n\nLike the feeling of the sun shining on your face after your town gets hit by a tornado or hurricane, \n\nLike the leaning tower of Pisa or the Coliseum in Rome, \n\nIt’s nice to look at but there is no structural integrity. \n\nIt’s gorgeous outside but the amount of destruction is astounding. \n\nThen you say wow, I did that, and now it’s over.  It has happened, it is so ordered. \n\nTime to clean up. 🧹 \n\nSo I shredded the ticket from the flamenco date. \n\nI gave away the purple dress from the dinner date at Jose Carlos Garcia in Malaga. \n\nThe Paris scarf. I’m wearing it in a picture by best friend put in a frame from last Thanksgiving. I looked so drained. Tired. Heartbroken. So I asked her to take it down. \n\nI cried a river on that Paris scarf after I wore it on the best first date, the best first kiss, \n\nAnd now I’m trashing every little thing that reminded me of the trash narcissist.  I gave the Paris scarf to the Goodwill today. \n\nI watched the dumpster fire burn. \n\nNow I’m scraping up the ash as the embers flicker. \n\nAm I done healing? \n\nNo.\n\nBut I’m no longer in the fog. I’m no longer bound by victimhood. There is 0% chance of a hoover because I blocked the narcissist and moved. Even if she did make contact I have nothing to say. I don’t need an apology or an explanation because I already know the why. I will never ever let anyone treat me like that again. I’ve never been treated so poorly by anyone in my life. I wouldn’t wish being with her on my worst enemy.\n\nAfter stalking me online I think the narcissist is self aware. Not every self aware narcissist is going to go to therapy. Many of them will use their education to figure out how they got caught and how they can avoid detection. Knowing the narcissist I have unbridled confidence that’s what she will do with this knowledge: try to become a better gaslighter, try to be better at feigned sincerity. \n\nI can no longer be fooled, the love goggles are off, the fog has dissipated. \n\nDo you know a narcissist with a genuine spirit of remorse?\n\nIt doesn’t exist. It’s an emotion they cannot access. It defies the disorder for them to explore why they’ve done something wrong. That’s why it’s always someone else’s fault. That’s not someone I want to marry and that’s not someone whose genetics I want passed down to my child. There is limited but still significant evidence that narcissism is heritable, and there is no cure for it. When a narcissist stops therapy, the compulsions restart and their disorder becomes just as apparent as it was. You can verify this claim with Dr Ramani, Dr Vaknin, Dr Carmen Bryant, any subject matter expert will corroborate this. \n\nThe narcissist in my past made a few grand gestures, \n\nBut after those gestures she receded back into her baseline of mediocrity and selfishness. \n\nThen when she was called out for her bullshit she pointed to those grand gestures to try to sprinkle glitter on top of what is still bullshit. \n\nA narcissist can give you a fauxpology and really mean it because they need your supply. The disorder will still have its way. The disorder will compel the narcissist to devalue and discard anyone and everyone that gets close. \n\nIt was good that I got that lesson before too much of the comparison game with the recycled supply. Since she’s a sex worker and former drug dealer with no education, it’s hard for me to even see why the narcissist would want to keep going back to that. But, I understand that being a grade A supply, a doormat that falls for all the narcissists games and tricks is much more important to them than social status or occupation. \n\nIt’s all about supply for them. \n\nAs I was moving out, I mentioned that I moved for her as she tried to diminish the things I did to show her I loved her. She got enraged and said: \n\n“You’re a grown woman, I didn’t tell you to move. You did that because you wanted to!”\n\nA narcissist has to blame shift. They can’t help but to, that’s why all of them say things like that. \n\nYeah, that’s a no for me. \n\nI put a second phone on record and stashed it in the narcissists car since I worked nights. I heard her doing the same thing to the recycled supply she did when she monkey branched to me: calling her when she got off work. The narcissist listened more than she talked. Usually just saying “yeah, exactly, I get you,” parroting what she just heard. One time I heard the narcissist say “are you going to shower and cook for me?” just like she did to me. \n\nI heard her accent and vernacular shift to match the recycled supply. I was disgusted to see the mirroring, but I remember noticing her mimicking me too.\n\nIt hurt to see the cycle repeat itself, but I’m really glad that I did. That was my closure: to know I’m actually dealing with a narcissist bound to an abuse cycle. I know very few victims get to see that. \n\nNow I’m in love with Marilyn 2.0, with my lower and higher self fully aligned. \n\nMy focus is on me, \n\n100% of my power to forgive will be spent on myself for blowing past red flags to chase my own demise. \n\nOvercoming narcissistic abuse is just one little part of my journey. \n\nThe narcissist came with a lesson for me: growth is obligatory or continue to wonder why your relationships are disastrous. \n\nIn that way I’m grateful for the version of me the discard helped me to become. \n\nA cluster B free Marilyn. \n\nThe emotional development and the spiritual acuity to see a Cluster B from a mile away, \n\nBecause of the work I’m doing on myself. 🦋\n\n",

        "Text": "2nd time dating a narcissistic person. How did I fall into their trap. Hoping after this; I will learn and run away. \n\nI am currently in therapy. Where I explained my most recent relationship of 3 years that just abruptly ended; and some of the behaviors that my partner was exhibiting. She responded with “I don’t like labels, but he sounds like a narc”. \n\nFirst red flag that I swept under the rug was; he cheated on me right after he asked me to be his girlfriend. With ; get this--his narcissistic ex girlfriend. He would always tell me she put him through hell; but I think this was possible projecting OR they were both narcs.\n\nI told him I didn't like cheating and that I wanted to leave this new relationship to which he begged me to stay for. I remember looking into his eyes, that seemed convincing but also didn't feel quite right. A year later he kept his word and didn't cheat anymore but my trust with him was just shattered. He was always weird with his phone , and would get angry when I wanted to talk about the issue. \n\nHalf of the relationship was good and the other half was not. He physically neglected me; which is abuse and would not like to cuddle, be touched and hated sex. He said he had intimacy issues in his last 2 relationships as well, and refused to get help for it but said \"he was doing the work\". I respected his wishes but was feeling depressed and knew it was neglect. His excuse was \"you are an emotionally unsafe partner.\"\n\nHe knew everything. And when he didn't, he had to triple check to make sure he was right somehow. If I was ever right about anything he has to fact check everything I said. That's a sneaky way of making me doubt myself over time. \n\nHe did the circular arguing with \"see you always do this. I can never have a real conversation with you\". He constantly made me feel like I had so many issues so I got therapy I constantly worked on myself and it was never up to his expectations. I was an emotional wreck ; where as he showed zero emotion, and said he has very good control of his emotions that's why he doesn't overreact. \n\nAfter 3 years of this, he has discarded me. Possibly because I fought back this entire time, and I see who he really is. I don't want this to to happen again. \n\n",

        "Text": "I have just left my narc partner. Our relationship lasted almost 18 months and I want to tell people about it, to inform and educate, I would also love to hear from people who have had similar experiences and to know if the stuff I experienced was as unique as I once thought it was. Right, here goes! I met my ex via facebook and he had vaguely known friends of mine, more in passing from teenage years. We met after a lot of online flirting and meaning to meet up, but it never happened ( something about him was off and he appeared haughty, but the flirting was so nice so I ignored my negative thoughts!) One day we went for it. Our first date was quite awkward, But we kissed at the end of it. I do remember getting a weird kind of scared feeling after our first snog because it was so forceful but, again put the feeling at the back of my mind. After two days of texting non stop he asked me to be his gf, I was happy and although I thought it was weird all he text me was about how amazing we will be together and only seemed to focus on our relationship, I thought maybe he was just like that and I loved the attention! 2 weeks went by well and although he had ED problems Things went well, he got some viagra and that side got better and better! around this time I went away on holiday, I couldn't wait to get back home to him and spent the weekend, he told me how his ex used to try and get him jealous on facebook and how his ex wife was very abusive and accused him of things to stop him seeing his kids when they first split. I had no reason to not believe him. The next day I was at home when I got some ridiculous texts from him, clearly enraged that someone had made a silly comment on my status on facebook, he went completely over the top but I just thought he was insecure. That was after 3 and a half weeks after we got together and literally weekly after the same thing would happen. He would sometimes wake me up in the night texting or phoning me, so angry he had found a picture or a comment or something from say, 10 years back on my facebook. I got engaged with him hoping it would stop but it seemed to get worse, we would have arguments that I apparently started if I ask a simple question about anything, he would flirt with someone infront of me or mention exes to get a reaction, I learnt not to react. Half of these things I only see now, I didn't realise at the time. He would do things like make fun of me, tell me he was more intelligent than me, make negative comments about me, then next day say how gorgeous and lovely I was. He would say I was possessive and controlling, but it was the other way around, we bathed, ate abd slept when he said. He would say he wanted something or criticise me for not helping around the house enough but take over anyway or say he would do it. It was so confusing. More confusing was when he would make out I would make it awkward for him to see his kids, when i didn't. He would get turned on by how I dressed and then a later date argue with me about it. On two occasions it got physical. He grabbed me, he put his hand across my mouth, screaming fxxx off repeatedly. The swearing and name calling was everu couple of months. 6 weeks after the last physical attack I left. I was so scared and confused but what the last straw was another circular conversation with no end that made no sense, he was cold didn't seem to care... I noticed when I left that he smelt really strongly of urine. I had never noticed thst before...\n \n",

        "Text": "I was left with a 3 month old baby, I had my car stolen and was left without transport in a rural area without public transport. My ex narc, had been having an affair with his ex, who he also has a child with. The signs were there, I just never thought it could be her. I was also horrified, as she had put in writing to a lawyer the abuse against her that he’d committed.. I don’t believe this woman is a victim of him too, I believe they are the same type of person, based on messages and interactions I’ve seen between them. I have never and will never reach out to this woman. \n\nI’ve recently been shown photos of the life of luxury they are living together.. holidays, renovations, designer everything… while here I am, struggling..\n\nI placed a FVO on him after he broke into my house and stole my car, that he put into his name. I’m leaving many details out, but the abuse from him was horrific.\n\nHe tried to get me to meet up with him once, I didn’t meet up with him because I was scared he would take my child. We have an order for a year and this as in place. He was stalking my social media for 6 months. I never acknowledged it him doing this. \n\nI have not heard from him since court, I asked him via message to sign paperwork to change the child’s last name, he gave me the address but has not filled it out and it’s been six months. \n\nHow do I stop thinking about him? A year later and I am still so confused. I can’t understand how he could do this to me and more importantly his daughter. I don’t understand how this woman, could document his behaviour and then take him back. I don’t understand any of it. I feel that I was a rebound and that is it. \n\nI’ve not heard from his family, I reached out once, crickets.. \n\nI’m trying to move on and date, but I cannot connect with anyone and now every man is a red flag. \n\nI’ve bettered myself this year, I’ve lost a lot of weight, I’ve improved my diet, I’m exercising regularly, everyone says I’m glowing from the changes I’ve made.

She has created an entire personality off his interests, which I find bizarre that a nearly 40 year old woman with 3 children is doing. She also uploads photos in lingerie and heavily filters them. I find myself trying to work out wtf is wrong with her too. Note: I have her blocked on everything, I was recently shown her profile, I had not looked in a year, because I didn’t want to be triggered.. was I triggered? YES. \n\nIf someone could give me some advice, I’d be very grateful. I’m disappointed it’s been a year and I can see how much better my life is, but he still pops into my head frequently. \n\nThank you x",

We have two phone calls this week really emotionally connective really good he hears me he’s listening he’s grappling with it but he hears me.\n\nTonight he calls me wasted and high on Xanax. The reason we broke up is because my niece was drinking and he didn’t think I was hard enough on her. He literally asked if she had stopped being a c***t. She’s fucking 16 years old and my ex was throwing underground raves and doing hard drugs at 16. Her friends had a mikes hard and a high noon in the basement. I took it away and said if I come down again and find anything everyone is going home. Like not the toughest reaction I’m open to other ideas but not a reason for my ex to say I have no respect for myself?? wtf. I told him respect for me should not be this variable. wtf.\n\nHe sent an incendiary email out to his office. He’s talking about how if they don’t value him and they don’t fucking do what he says and if they don’t get him his money he’ll burn the place to the ground and he’ll go to the competitor and he’ll this and he’ll that and yeah he’s just venting but it’s just a glimpse into his mind and his processing and his rage and his entitlement and his worldview and it’s insane. God I hope it was the drugs talking. Holy hell.\n\nAnd we talked a bit about the relationship. Earlier this week he’s talking about changing so he can like what he sees in the mirror and be the kind of man a woman would want to be with and talking about his childhood and its impact on him and how it made him love conditionally. Today? He’s like well you have a laundry list of things I have to fix that doesn’t sound right. \n\nI’m fucking devastated. I love this man. I see this man. Underneath it all, I SEE him and his suffering and he was right there, caring about the pain he’s caused me, seeing the truth, and now he’s fucked up on drugs saying well let’s figure out in a week or so if this is a break or a break up. I said how we’d raise our children matters. He says he doesn’t want his sons to pussies. I’m like HOW IS THAT YOUR MAIN PRIORITY?? You’re gonna perpetuate the cycle of abuse, the very cycle that you blame for your rage and suffering. More importantly, earlier this week you’re looking to change, to get better. Tonight I’m out of line for suggesting it.\n\nGod please let it be the drugs pleaseeee I am so so sad. I was hopeful for us but I was hopeful for him, too. wtf. Narcissists are fucking impossible they’re right there one second and you give them a minute alone to “process” and they’ve gone off the walls again. Fucking like let me speak like him for a second “sit down, shut up, and listen to me, get in line or you’ll be on the unemployment line.”\n\nI love this guy SO MUCH this is my third or fourth narcissist and I’ve never been so close to getting through to one and it just blew up again, as fucking expected, I am so fucking pissed. And so sad. \n\nYou’re RIGHT THERE. What tf goes on???\n\nI will let you know if we talk and he’s back to something productive. I am praying for him goddamnit it’s like loving a wolf caught in a bear trap and it won’t stop attacking you like LET ME GET YOU OUT OF THIS TRAP.\n\nI get that borderlines are nightmares to deal with too but these guys, the self awareness defense mechanisms?? Omg. I’ve never been so upset about this in my life. So fucking close. And I LOVE HIM. Christ. \n\n\n",

Today this girl messaged me, I have not been in contact with her for almost a year since our friends circle had a massive fallout while I was still with my narc ex, that she and my narc ex have recently developed a “soft corner” for each other and wanted to let me know. lol. The audacity. This did trigger me though. Because there’s so much that happened. My narc ex being himself has literally ridiculed this girl to the core in front of me and others and to now think that they plan on being together. I want to applaud to both of their faces. It all could also be very well a facade of my nex to try and force a feelings back toward him. I would admit it does feel a lot like a betrayal and “how could you”. Because I’m not a naturally insecure person, but my nex made me care so much about this girl while she was in our friend group that we have multiple breakdowns over it and had cut contact for so long. Anyway, they both do deserve each other. And as much as I want to call my nex as the girl who texted me suggested that I should, I will not. Best revenge is that he doesn’t get a reaction out of me. Only work for me now is spend my weekend processing these emotions and trigger in a healthy manner due to this unexpected poke I was not planning for. Also, it’s been only one month since he last flew down here and tried to meet me & call me and to think he decided to move on now with this girl. \n\nEdit: just realized that this is called triangulation ",

Just being in the same room as her makes me feel sick to my stomach. I can't stand to look at her. The sound of her voice makes me want to slice my ears off. The way she looks, even something so little as the way her lips move makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a rusty spoon. Being told I look just like her legitimately makes me want to die. No matter what I do to my appearance, I always see her every time I look in the mirror and it makes me want to carve my face off. The idea that some people could see me as what she is..

But looking back, I believe you used BDSM as a smokescreen for abuse, and you were wrong when you said \"women can't abuse women\"- I am a woman and you abused me so severely, I have CPTSD and am in therapy for my PTSD. You were my first relationship, and I was a young, naive teenager, severely abused at home. I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the years of hell you inflicted on me. I wish I could have dated an empathetic, safe woman who loved me- not you, a wolf in sheep's clothing who love-bombed me then severely devalued and breadcrumbed me after hooking me in.\n\nWhen you told me you'd kill yourself if I ever left you, and you'd never forgive me if I did a welfare check, and then you'd ghost me for hours or sometimes even days afterwards... I wish I could have recognized that you were doing was suicide threats as emotional blackmail, I wished I'd been brave enough to call a Professional, instead of living in fear and confusion.\n\nThe first time you guilt tripped me when I did not feel up for doing a NSFW activity, I should have left you instead of sobbing in shame. The first time you did score-keeping, the first time you put down my hobbies and interests, the first time you negged me... I should have left.\n\nWhen you assaulted me and I froze in terror, unable to defend myself... that day, I should have called the police on you. If you assault another girlfriend, my heart aches for her, and I regret not reporting you or filing a restraining order.\n\nWhen you, after years of telling me you didn't want intimacy... contrasted to how during the first few months of the relationship, you tried to force intimacy on me even if I wasn't in the mood... and in addition to this, telling me we were not allowed to be friends on social media, not even Facebook friends... and you constantly accusing me of cheating on you when I never did... and when you insisted I could only see you once a month, acting annoyed every time I would call or text you, as if I was a burden... I wish I'd had the self love and self respect to recognize you had no love or respect for me and I deserved to be with someone who genuinely wanted me. When you got mono that I didn't give you, because I never had mono, I wished I would've questioned it, combined with the other red flags. I can't prove this but if you cheated on me, looking back, this would not be surprising to me.\n\nWhen I found out that you had joined a fetish website behind my back, and were private messaging people on there... weather or not you were cheating... I felt completely unlovable and unattractive. You constantly putting down my appearance and telling me I had to be butch, only to put me down when I dressed butch, to please you... messed with my self-image and gender expression. To this day, I feel ugly and unattractive.\n\nWhen you tried to control how I interact with my body, including my privates, even though I was uncomfortable and scared, but people-pleased out of fear... when you tried to isolate me from friends and everyone else until you were the only one, then acted annoyed that I had no one else to turn to...\n\nThere are countless memories of your psychological abuse that play in my head, years after all this happened. After 7 years of no contact, I feel like I'm still trapped in your web of cruelty.\n\nEvery time I see a girl that looks like you, I feel terrified. I haven't dated since our relationship. I haven't even made friends. I am living a life of isolation and fear, 7 years later. I feel my innocence is gone, replaced with cynicism, pessimism and fear. I question if I ever want to be in a relationship, ever again, after the nightmare you put me through for 4 years.\n\nBut... I am in trauma informed therapy, working on trying to reduce your power over me. I am learning how to love myself, so I won't be taken advantage of again. You know what? I almost feel sorry for you- you will never know love, kindness or empathy, because you are devoid of those qualities. I cannot imagine how empty and cruel of a creature you are. I would rather be myself, and live with CPTSD, than to be you, for even one day.\n\n\\- Your former victim, who is trying to move from victim to survivor",

He immediately turned it off without telling me he was turning it off and just blaming me for smelling bad or any number of things as to why he didn't want to have sex. We literally had the most mind blowing sex of our lives and our relationship and he saw me happy and he saw how good it was for me, and he turned the spigot off as quickly as he could and never let it flow again.\n\nThey crush our spirits.\n\nThey oppress us.\n\nThey compress us into something like a diamond ...a chunk of useless carbon until the experts recognize them.\n\nIf you're struggling please go to my profile and read my comments and posts.\n\nThe map of what I'm  doing on my journey is there.\n\nI hope ya'll find a gem there for yourself. \n\nYou deserve it.\n",

So I'll give a bit of backstory and then my questions.\n\n**Backstory:** I was raised in a covert narcissist home. N-mom was moderately physically disabled, e-dad did what e-dads do... the bidding of n-mom so they don't get fed to the alligator. e-mom was Munchausen by proxy as well. I grew up in poverty, food assistance, free and reduced lunch, WIC, etc. I was raised for the most part by my grandma, and when I was there, I didn't have any behavior issues, or anything. But at home, I was obviously a real problem, at least to them.\n\nNow I'm in my 50's, and N-mom is getting older and having more health issues. She's been grooming my cousins and extended family for years for this moment and they all believe her dumb victim stories. I've gone basically no contact. And here is where I needs some advice and help.\n\n**Questions:** How do you deal with aging narc parents? I mean, if I stay no contact she's just sitting there saying, \"see I told you so\" to all of the people that will be left alive after she is finally gone. And if I jump in and play the \"dutiful son\" then I drag me and my entire family through hell... extended hell. Not just family holiday hell where you can get over it by March, but ongoing forever bs, and she will still sit there and tell everybody what a lousy person I am.\n\nSo, my gut instinct is to just stay away, and not engage at all. People can believe what they want , and I can protect my sanity, and the sanity of my people. But, maybe that's a mistake. Maybe I'm making a critical error somewhere and I just can't see it. What do you think? Advice welcome.",

        "Text": "My ex-husband is someone I need to deal with sometimes to talk about our tween children. But when I email he never replies. He's not responded in well over two years. Stupidly I attracted someone exactly the same and I'm now trying to shake off a break up with him, where he - low and behold - stonewalled me out of the relationship.\n\nI just want to know if anyone has any advice for not allowing the stonewalling to get to them so badly? I seem to turn into an aggressive ball of rage over it. I need to cut the cord with these people and not allow it to get to me so much! It makes me so frustrated, emotional, and I can end up crying. I'm sure I have PTSD from both of them. \n\nI've tried some 'cutting the cord meditations' but honestly it just made me more depressed... not sure what else to do. Maybe with time they will just go away forever and I can move on in peace with my life.",

        "Text": "I was in a relationship with a narc for almost 2 years. We met at work. He’s a clinical psychologist… thought he could help me become a more healed person… early on he wanted to know all the pain or trauma I’ve had in my life, which I thought I could share with him given his professional background…. When I tell you this man used every bit of sensitive sacred information I shared with him against me to degrade me, dismiss me, invalidate me and try to isolate me from my family…. It was horrific… our last fight was provoked by him complaining about how I stopped sharing information with him about my son, my mother, essentially my family… who he absolutely hates… when I did concede and told him about some fears I had about going home for thanksgiving…. He screamed “what damn near 50 year old still has daddy issues”… he also stated my entire family uses me and I have no boundaries with them and of course he’s the only person who truly cares about me….that was the final blow…. He is a monster. He will never change. He’s deliberately tried to isolate me from my family for at least a year… He is a dangerous person. This recent blowup happened this week. I haven’t left the house in two days… yesterday I slept almost 12 hours…. Post breakup do you all feel that you need more rest than usual? Is this normal? Am I going through some sort of depression? Will I regain my vitality and desire to leave the house? ",

        "Title": "I suspect my ex cheated on me, but I don't have solid proof. I'm trying to rebuild my sense of self and my sense of body autonomy years after the break up.",
        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "I dated my ex for around 4 years and looking back I suspect she had been cheating on me and I was too in love with her, too afraid to leave her, and my mind was so jumbled, I didn’t see what I believe were subtle warning signs she was likely cheating.\n\nI thought our relationship was lesbian BDSM (we were both girls) but this was my first relationship and looking back I believe she was abusive and using BDSM as a smokescreen. She used to say that lesbian relationships were superior and girls couldn’t abuse girls and I believed her. We dated from teenagehood-early adulthood. We lived really close together but she only wanted to see me around once a month and I was really lonely all the time. But when I texted or called even if I was having a panic attack, she often acted annoyed like I was a nuisance and talking to me was a chore. My girlfriend constantly told me she’d kill herself if I ever left her, assaulted me months before the break up happened, constantly accused me of cheating when I never did, I felt like I couldn’t have friends when I was dating her and ended up isolated and profoundly lonely, she frequently guilt-tripped me and put me down… but there are some incidents in specific running through my head today.\n\nFor the first few months we were together, she wanted us to watch porn, masturbate each other and do some BDSM stuff like her tying me up and spanking and whipping me. One day, she told me she felt like self-harming and I talked her out of it, and we saw each other later that day. She wanted to watch porn that night and I told her I didn’t feel up for it that night. She said to me, “I have done so many things for you, why can’t you just do this one thing for me?” I sobbed when she said this to me and vividly remember how terrible I felt.\n\nAfter the first few months, she and I almost never kissed, and she (literally) never wanted us to do anything intimate. She said it was because she was abused when she was younger and I just had to be patient with her, so I felt terrible that I wanted us to be intimate and like there was something wrong with me. But it was confusing that the first few months we dated, she insisted we do all those things, guilt tripping me if I wasn’t in the mood, to suddenly never-wanting-us-to-do-anything for literally the rest of the relationship. I ended up feeling undesirable and ugly (she implied she thought I wasn’t physically attractive, and she worked as a part time model, she insisted she was femme and told me I had to be butch, but I don’t think she actually liked butch women).\n\nMy girlfriend also told me that as a requirement (not a preference, a requirement) to have sex with her, I had to shave my privates. I felt really scared and really didn’t want to, but I felt like I had no choice, and I shaved it all off. I hated it. My skin hurt, it was irritating and itchy, I didn’t feel like myself… but I did it. I never asked or demanded she do anything with her body hair… but I noticed that she sometimes didn’t shave her legs when I saw her legs. When I considered my bare, irritated privates and contrasted that with her not shaving her legs, her legs not being irritated, her having full choice on her body while I felt like I didn't have a choice with mine... I felt like I wanted to cry.\n\nEven though she never even looked at my privates after telling me that shaving was a requirement for us to have sex, I kept shaving for years, the entire time I was with her, in case she ever did want to see my privates, to prove to her that I was meeting the requirements for having sex, to show to her that I was a good girlfriend and a good submissive and doing what she wanted even though I was uncomfortable and unhappy. That was my mentality at the time, I convinced myself this made me a good girlfriend, a good submissive… it feels like my body autonomy, my comfort, was a sacrifice to her. It hurt so badly, but I thought this was just BDSM, and I was confused and felt guilty at how upset I was over this stuff with shaving, but I thought feeling upset meant I wasn't a real submissive so I'd beat myself up over feeling bad about the stuff with shaving and tell myself I was over-sensitive. \n\nLooking back, part of me feels hurt that I did this to my body, that I met the requirement... for an act that never happened... but part of me is relieved that I didn't give her my virginity. \n\nMy girlfriend didn’t want us to be friends on social media. She said it was because she had an abusive father in another state (she was no contact with, her mom and stepdad were no contact too) but she claimed she didn’t want her abusive bio dad to ever find her on social media and see that we were friends because she wanted to protect me from him. Looking back, I question this story of hers, but I believed her at the time. But I felt sad and hurt I couldn’t even send her a friend request on Facebook and that online we had to hide that we even knew each other- it wasn’t just that we couldn’t say we were in a romantic relationship, she did not even want our facebook status to simply be friends on Facebook, even though she had other facebook friends.\n\nShe joined a fetish website without telling me, I think it was fetlife, I found out about this shortly before the break up. She was direct messaging people on there. I didn’t look at her messages... but something about this didn’t feel right. Especially because I once got a text from someone at school when I was with her, and she yanked my phone out of my hand and scrolled through my texts and said “I’m just making sure you are not cheating on me”. This felt hurtful and upsetting because I never grabbed her phone and made accusations when she got a text!\n\nAt one point, early in the relationship, she got mono. I know mono can be passed many different ways, but  my family teased me over my girlfriend having \"the kissing disease\", and I felt upset. I didn’t give her mono. In fact, I've never had mono. It’s possible she got it in a completely innocent manner, but looking back… it’s possible she got mono because she was cheating on me, even early on. \n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI heavily suspect my ex was cheating on me, even though I never snooped and I don’t have solid proof. All these memories flooded me this morning, and I think they could be indicators she likely cheated on me. But at the time… I never questioned she was cheating, because I was convinced that because I wasn’t cheating, that must mean she was faithful too.\n\nI hate that I altered my body hair for her even though it was painful, itchy and uncomfortable. I hate that I made myself Butch because she insisted I “had” to be Butch. I hate that I loved her. I hate everything about my relationship with her. I’m glad I’m no contact- she never deserved my love and loyalty. My body, my heart, my autonomy, is mine now.",

The highs were high, the shared fantasy was beautiful, but the deception, abuse, and triangulation was more than I can handle. I have mostly an earned secure attachment style but my disorganized fearful avoidant was fully triggered with this man. \n\nIt’s sad because I figured, hey, we’re both messed up - maybe we can be honest about who we are and step into the light together. He even suggested we do couples counseling, which we did, even though I felt it was a major red flag and a means to keep me around for longer/look past his bs. \n\nHe crossed another boundary for the last time on Monday, took zero accountability, and I dumped his ass Friday evening. \n\nAm I sad? \n\nAbsolutely heartbroken. \n\nDo I miss him? \n\nYes, I miss my friend, my lover, and our shared fantasy of a present and future where things are good. \n\nBut the fact is I was miserable, on edge, physically, mentally & emotionally drained, and frankly (this is the narc in me) I’m too kind, hot, successful, and smart to allow his lack of consideration and awareness to bring me down. \n\nIf a narc actually wants to change you will notice a genuine and consistent effort (not days or weeks — months and years) and you will FEEL it in your body and mind that things have truly changed for the better. If they are acting, you’ll know it deep down. \n\nIf you smell bs, and you’ve been smelling it for months or years & nothing has changed - leave if you can. I know it’s hard, this is my second narc, the first I dated was for four years and I was so naive and devastated after the discard I fell into a 2-year depression. \n\nSecond time around, I know better. \n\nSave yourself the heartache. \n\nPut yourself first. \n\nI promise you will eventually be fine (stronger & better than ever) if you make healing a priority. 💛\n",

        "Text": "I’m still processing what happened. Let me start by saying he’s an amazing guy. I love him. He was really trying. We both were.\n\nHe got mad so often and so explosively. I gave him a codified list on how to heal and regulate rage and dysregulated emotions and a website on cultivating compassion.\n\nWe broke up because we were fighting every 2 weeks or so. He just kept coming at me and I was losing my patience. He got mad at me for asking hypotheticals like “if I were a gay man and you were a gay man would you still love me?”\n\nThe last fight we had he disagreed with how I handled my niece misbehaving. He left that night in Uber (he was always doing that, hanging up on me, leaving in an Uber, telling me to take an Uber home, etc, because he couldn’t control his temper). The next day we tried to talk it out. He confronted me on not setting good enough boundaries with my niece. He said I let her walk all over me and I had no self respect. I said you can have your opinions but the problem is that they’re coming from judgement and not love. The problem is your respect for me is really variable and respect for your partner should be consistent. He said he’s judgemental and his respect is variable and he’s ok with it. I also said if anyone walks all over me it’s you for the past 10 months. He didn’t like that.\n\nThe irony is he broke up with me for not setting boundaries or having enough self respect, but like if I had healthy boundaries I would’ve broken up with him the first time he screamed at me and kicked me out of the car. And maybe I don’t have enough self respect or need healthier boundaries, but the truth is I felt compassion for him and I was trying to help him. I did what I could to confront him kindly and correct the problems in his processing.\n\nMy therapist said he’s projecting because he subconsciously knows that he’s been treating me poorly. My other friend dated a narcissist and the same thing happened—her partner would get mad at her for not standing up for herself with other people, but meanwhile she was getting steamrolled by her partner who really couldn’t tolerate anyone who was able to confront her.\n\nIt’s been a couple of days. I have a bit of of BPD so I asked him to call it a break because I couldn’t handle a break up, but I don’t see us getting better. I can’t handle him constantly finding reasons that I’m the problem and starting fights and I can’t handle the constant leaving or kicking me out or hanging up and I can’t handle the variable respect. He says I love people, the good and the bad, all rolled into a ball, I love the whole thing, but he has a system of scales. How do you convince someone they’re loving wrong? That respect should be consistent? That they’re abusive and need help?\n\nI feel sad because we said we were gonna stay friends but I’m realizing that processing the relationship is gonna take me to some dark places. I want to love him whole and move past this but reflecting on the past 6 months or so I’m just kind experiencing some anger and resentment and sadness. I’m understanding that this was abusive and that even though I tried to help I really couldn’t. And I want to find a way to look at him with kindness and love or find a way to think of the relationship as just a lack of compatibility but it feels really rough.\n\nAnyway he’s a good guy. I know I’m lucky and lot what goes on with people is a lot worse. He tried like hell to hear me but they just struggle with self awareness he would go in and out of it. It’s just too hard for him to look at it.\n\nAnyway. Thanks for listening ",

I told him I was engaged, and all he said was, \"damn. You moved on fast\". \n\nHe tried to win me back after finding out I got engaged. This was a year ago. He was still asking to be fwb and claiming that the girl he was living with wasn't his gf. He even insisted that if I proceeded with the marriage, he would rent a hotel room once a month so that we could meet. He later changed this and said they were in an open relationship. He also said that they connect on an emotional level but that he's not as physically attracted to her as he is to me, and that's why he was shooting his shot at me. They are both broken people, but they look good together, and they have the same lifestyle. \n\nHe said all kinds of things to win me back, and I almost gave in, but my gut just said no. \n\nI got married last May. I told him I didn't want anything to do with him and we would be moving in 2 years anyway. There is no need for us to be friends like he suggested since we won't be crossing paths. He proposed to her 2 months later and said they planned to get married next year. All of a sudden, our mutual friend attended their wedding today.\n\nMy question is, am I crazy, or it seems like a competition? Is he trying to prove that he can commit but not with me? He tries to do the same when I reach a milestone. He told me he'd never get married, but here he is with his \"the one.\" \n\nWhy is he suddenly ready to commit and seem like a perfect partner for her? The questions I used to ask myself when he left *(what do I not have? Why can't he commit? I do everything he says and give him my best. So why her and not me? We were pregnant, but he asked me to abort it and threatened to leave if I didn't)* suddenly made their way back into my head. I can't believe another girl is benefiting from the hardships I've been through. After reflecting on how badly he treated me, he said I changed him for the better. He'll treat his wife right this time because he doesn't want to treat anybody as wrong as he treated me. \n\nIt's weird because I have these thoughts, but my initial feeling was, \"Oh, no. I feel bad for her\". I feel horrible for saying that, but I can't help but think that this brave girl who moved to this new country on her own after being in an *abusive relationship (he told me)* with no family and not many friends is now tied to him forever.",

I wasn’t doing great, but I have come to terms with things in my situation and am feeling a little more empowered. \n\nI allowed my nex to do things with me. Get ice cream, go to the movies. It was was weird. He wants to take me out for my birthday because he says everyone deserves to have a good birthday (yes, I know). He even offered to gift me the down payment on a house if I wanted my own home. This should be a giant red flag, I think. He claims he’s a kind person who wants me to thrive.  \n\nDespite being more empowered since and starting to understand I wasn’t the issue, the communication factor was brought up again. Everyone seems to think I am a solid communicator but him. Admittedly, I do leave out context from time to time. I’ve been told that there could be many reasons for that. ADHD, I’m hyper-vigilant and afraid to speak to him, etc. He says spending time with him terrifies him because he is afraid I’ll say something disconnected and he will lose it. Now, he claims it’s not my leaving out context. It’s when he repeats what I say, I stay committed to what I’ve said and I’m like, yeah. He doesn’t think he has to ask me clarifying questions because that’s too frustrating and he’s tired of it. I offered in the past it might be helpful for him to provide a gentle warning or ask me gently, is this what you meant to say? Is something missing? But he said he shouldn’t have to. Are these excuses? Any thoughts on why he is the only person I act like this with? \n\nI think the worst part for me, is that he told me he told his family about all this and they agreed it’s insane. No one else in the world communicates like this. It all makes me feel both he and they can see something else everyone in my life can’t. It makes me feel isolated and incapable. He even brought up that maybe my ex-husband was so quiet all the time because he found it unbearable and confusing to talk to me. It was a low blow, which he shockingly apologized for. I just think I don’t know what to think, or feel, or do so I can improve and this can’t ever happen again in my life. \n\nIs he the issue? Unwilling to work on it? He claims communication can be worked on but there’s a point where it has to be done. I don’t know. I heard you all and i am getting myself together to move away from him, but I am concerned about my being the most insane person to have ever been spoken to to the point where “he questions his reality” as I double down on “yes, that’s what I said” and don’t immediately correct it once it’s repeated back to me. \n\nThanks, friends.

        "Text": "So my parents divorced when I was 12. My sister was 15 at the time. My dad was physically and emotionally abusive towards my mom but after the divorce I was the proxy. However, my mom even though she is the victim she is also a narcissist (clinically diagnosable). \n\nWhen I was 17 years old, my dad and stepmom beat me up one night for talking back at them. I ran out of the house and called my mom, I asked to live with them and never come back. My mom told me she will be there to pick me up. But an hour later, I was picked up by my stepmom and my heart dropped. I mentioned this to my mom yesterday and she told me she called my grandpa and he said he would promise I will be fine and that she shouldn’t come pick me up because my stepmom is here (in Chinese culture maybe it’s just not okay). My mom said grandpa lied to her and she did everything she could. But my question was…where were you when I needed you the most?  But my mom and sister became hysterical that I told them I was very disappointed. I am in fact very disappointed, and they made me feel it was wrong to feel that way. Now I’m 28 and whenever I express and explained my personal boundaries, they would accuse me of being “distant”. My mom would always use health as an excuse “oh I have a headache, and you are making it worse” or “I have a heart problem and you are making me feel worse”, when in reality I was just setting a simple boundary, and I said it in a polite and calm manner at first. But as soon as I’m getting annoyed, she would slam me with all of those guilt-trips. When I visited my mom this January 2024, we went and saw a family friend who also very weirdly made shady comments about my mom that she is manipulative. I told my mom and sister about this to explain why I don’t fully trust my mom (why would a friend say something like that about you for no reason?). They exploded. My sister blamed me for remembering this and she said “our mom don’t even quite  remember this, but you do” (I mean…isn’t that the point?). Before my mom left the group chat, she said “I’m so hurt and I can’t believe you don’t know what kind of person I am”. She again made me feel awful for bringing up something someone said and deflected the conversation. \n\nI came back to the US and finished my masters in social work. I think I am a pretty fair person and very much care about people’s emotions and dignity. My sister and mother commented that I “changed” and have been questioning a lot about the past and that they don’t like this version of me. ",

        "Text": "So I recently got out of a situation and after talking to this person’s ex roommate who used the term covert narcissist, I’m having a lot of realizations. I never new covert narcissists were a thing. (Which is surprising since that’s what my mother was.) So I’m just reaching out to see if anyone has experienced this type of thing before and if there are any types of therapy they can recommend. \n\nI’m going to try to make this short since it’s still hard to talk about but it’s inside of me and I kind of need to get it out. \n\nI met this person online. We’d been following each other for about 10 years but never really interacted. I’d been feeling quite lonely at the time and she reached out. We became fast friends and she’s the author of one of my (now former) favorite fanfiction stories so we talked about this a lot. At first I figured it was common ground but after a while, it got a little annoying because it seemed like that’s all she wanted to talk about. (Red flag I missed.) Eventually we became closer and talked about every day life. Shortly after I developed feelings. It wasn’t love. It was just a crush. I told her and we had a conversation about it where she let me know she didn’t feel the same way. But it was all good. I appreciated the honesty and we remained close. I lost my job due to lay offs and she offered me a room rent free. I was apprehensive at first and months went by when finally I accepted. \nAbout a month after I accepted, our relationship changed again. She reciprocated feelings and the possibility of something more was very much open and on the table. Eventually she began sexting me. She always initiated it because I didn’t want to push the envelope and the ball was in her court. She sexted me almost every day for about a month and even up until the night before I arrived to her place. \n\nAfter arriving we mostly just cuddled a lot and that was it. Things shifted. It was all talk. Two weeks after I got there, she pulled the plug and just wanted to remain friends. I went on a bit of a downward spiral because quite frankly, that made the whole thing feel like a complete lie. Like I stroked her ego and then once I was there, shit got real. She said that she wasn’t over her ex and that she never craves sex. (Even though she spent 3 weeks sexting me.) The way she explained it was also kind of shamey sounding too that I like sex and she is basically ace. Like I was less than her because I’m a sexual being and she’s not. But alas, we still cuddled for a couple months, her always initiating, and eventually it all stopped. \n\nThen slowly, her attitude started to change. She always acted like this super sensitive empath but after a while, that turned into her being just unnecessarily rude. Like I’d say hi to her and I’d get a grunt from her. Or she was teaching me this game and she took the fun out of it by being overly critical and very condescending. Then she’d make condescending remarks. She’d text me all aggressively about shit but then later on would remark that she didn’t mean to make me feel xyz. If I called her out on something, she’d get defensive or very subtly imply that I perceived it wrong. I started having suicidal thoughts briefly and that’s when things really shifted. She always made it about her. How my suicidal thoughts triggered her. (I entered therapy very shortly after thing and stopped opening up to her about it.) There was a few weeks where I’d just keep my door closed because I was so sick of her negative attitude that I just wanted to create a safe, positive environment in my room. Apparently this was triggering to her because it gave her anxiety about what was going on in my room. In reality I was just blocking her out because I didn’t want her negative energy to bring me down. \nEventually she asked me about why my door was closed all the time and I told her. She then went on to tell me that all those times we cuddled made her uncomfortable (even though she initiated it) and that she felt like her privacy has been compromised because that’s what happens when you live with someone (she asked me to move in????) This type of shit she did to her last roommate. Always moving the goalpost to suit her. She also made a comment that like she feels like she’s being punished ever since she rejected me but like my first thought is like… actions have consequences?? To be quite Frank it’s like yeah, you deserve some punishment for the manipulative bullshit you pulled when you led me on. \n\nI tried to end my life a few weeks ago because, well, I feel like shit. She knows this and hasn’t reached out to me since. I’m okay now. Several therapists have also called this covert narcissism. It feels like my head has been fucked with. Although I take comfort in knowing that like this wasn’t my fault. Someone just had ill intentions. \n\nHer own mother has told her several times that she never asks about anyone else’s lives. It’s all about her. \n\nAnyways, thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I try EMDR? ",

Mind you, I am 5'4 and weighed about 110 pounds at the time and he was 6'4, about 185 pounds of per muscle. Like beating on me really just proved how less of a man he was. But nonetheless, the relationship wasn't worth saving. He discarded me and immediately went to the next girl. It took over a year for me to get over him. I have some knowledge or understanding that getting over a narc is really really hard because of the toxic trauma bond that is created. I want to say now, about 3 years later. I am fully moved on. I don't cry for him or yearn for him anymore. But my issue with the situation is sometimes memories flood in. Sometimes I do miss him or idk what it is. I just miss the good times, even when the bad times were fucking awful. Idk why. It confuses me. Because I know 100% in my heart that this man DOES NOT care about me and never did. But my love and empathy remains the same for him. I remember the very last time I saw him, he was on tinder in front of me and when I confronted him, he beat the shit out of me, busted my lip, gave me a black eye, tons of bruises, you name it. He held me at gun point, locked me in a room. And after all of it, I forgave him and prayed that he wouldn't leave. Our brains are such a dangerous place sometimes. ",

But she seems to have massive blinders on.\n\nCase and point: I (and a few others) have had our numbers and social media blocked. But she managed to reach out to me a few months ago and ask for a mutual friend's number that she \"lost\" somehow. A few days ago, she stopped by our workplace. She said she never blocked any of us. It was all HIM because he has control of her phone and takes it sometimes. I said maybe that's how you lost So-and-so's number. She just kinda considered it and said \"That makes a lot of sense.\" She also said she hated leaving her job so early, but HE found out an ex of hers lived nearby and he didn't want her to \"give into temptation.\" She was about four months pregnant at the time (btw, she said their marriage was next month. He claimed in one of his YouTube videos that they were already married. Obviously this was just to cover his ass because he got her pregnant out of wedlock)\n\nI had to get back to work, and she had to go too. But I got the feeling she wanted to talk more, and it took a lot for me to hold my tongue. I've been trying to say something to her for over a year now, but she's not seeing it. She's basically admitted this guy is controlling and insecure. Is there anything any of us can say to her? Or is she far enough gone that we have to let this play out? As always, thanks in advance for your insight.",

        "Text": "I’m going to keep this as vague as I can, although everyone knows BobZombie has been my nickname for years. I won’t mention names, but I have to get this out. Journaling isn’t helping me, and my closest friends support me but they also shame me for still thinking about her. I want to share what I went through for 5 years in an attempt to get some weight off my own shoulders, and potentially help someone else in a similar situation. If you’re a friend of the enemy reading this, what I’m about to say is the truth whether you like it or not. \n\nIt all began with a love bomb. I began commenting back and forth with this beautiful woman on Facebook. We were talking about our recent exes and the misery we had gone through. Little did I know, I was telling her my weaknesses right from the start. Telling her exactly how to hit me. Comments turned to messages turned to texts, and before you know it, we had planned a date. \n\nThe first date, she ghosted me. No texts, nothing. I was left sitting alone in a Walmart parking lot (no joke, it was even raining). I stood up for myself and left her a nasty message on Snapchat, since I was blocked on everything else. \n\nA week or two later she reached out to me and apologized. She said her ex had hacked all of her accounts and that was why she had ghosted me. I believed it like a simp. She was the most beautiful woman who had ever been interested in me. How could I say no?\n\nThings got physical. All the sex I could ever want. She would come over to my house (I’m fortunate enough to own my own house) and bring her one year old with her. On February 14th of all days she said to me “Are you gonna ask me out or what?” I can’t remember if I was ready for a new relationship or not; I was still pretty fresh from my ex, but I knew I wanted her. She became my girlfriend. \n\nHer car wasn’t the greatest and sometimes wouldn’t start, and she told me that her hot water failed sometimes, her electricity failed sometimes, and it was nearly winter. You know what I did next, don’t you? “Why don’t you guys just move in with me?”\n\nThings moved fast, and why shouldn’t they? We were perfect. We never fought, we agreed on everything, she loved horror movies and metal music just like me. A tall, sexy brunette, long legs and tattoos and dark hair. I knew I had found the one. I couldn’t possibly do better than this angel. \n\nWe quite literally just decided to have a baby one night while talking in bed. I was so in love that my whole attitude about kids had changed, especially after learning to change diapers and stuff like that while watching her one year old when she worked on my days off.  I started eating a lot of avocado, and she was pregnant. \n\nWe got married on Halloween of 2020. She knew someone who could legally do it, and as we’re both atheists, we didn’t want to go the traditional route. We got married at a Halloween party dressed as Ghostface and Pennywise.  We each signed the paper, and that was that. Husband and wife. \n\nThe problems began with her pregnancy. I know all about postpartum depression, so I’m not blaming her for her mental state after our son was born.  She had told me that her mom had put her in a mental institution before because she caught her listening to music that was “satanic”. Yes, I believed that. But I had no idea what I was in for. \n\nOnce, while she was pregnant, we were having sex and I accidentally hurt her. She screamed “You’re crushing the baby!” And it terrified me. From then on, sex kinda scared me. I didn’t know how to do it right, apparently, without hurting my son.  That wasn’t the only issue though. \n\nMy ex had said before, being totally fair to her here, that she didn’t want to be in a sexless marriage. I didn’t either, who the hell does? She even said that if we ended up in one, she could envision herself cheating on me. No pressure, right?\n\nShe began to accuse me of not being attracted to her anymore because her pregnancy had caused her to gain weight. Any father will tell you that a pregnant woman carrying your child is beautiful, and she was to me. The problem was that instead of looking forward to sex as a release, it was becoming a time bomb in the room. The more I stressed, the less I wanted it. The less she got it, the angrier she got. \n\nShe took her ring off and threw it in my lap. “If you’re not even going to try, I’ll start looking for apartments tomorrow.” Another particularly nasty shot I’ll never forget is “I should have known better than to ever have a kid with you.”\n\nSomewhere along the line, she became friends with my ex. The same ex I had been venting about when we met. She decided they were best friends! She had never connected with someone like that before! Was I willing to bury the hatchet and let them be friends?\n\nEvery fiber of my being was screaming no. I told her I didn’t like it. I didn’t want to be around my ex.  That very same ex had lived in the house with me previously— talk about awkward. When the inevitable fight came, I was met with “I am allowed to have friends, you are not going to control me! I’ll leave!” That was the first time I seriously considered leaving her. But we had two kids involved. \n\nI gritted my teeth and did my best. Then one night around a campfire, they brought up being a little more than friends. The other boyfriend was okay with it if I was, and they could fool around on the side. I said no. They then teased me about it; about the fact that I was paranoid. “If you’re gonna accuse me of cheating, I’ll do it.” We were watching a movie one night and my ex left my side to go sit with her on the other couch, draping her legs over her lap. I freely admit here, friends, that I exploded. I made a scene, slammed the door, really made it awkward. I was the one who was wrong for doing that, however. \n\nThe next phase was my ex going over to her house nearly every weekend to hang out. I was home with the kids while she went out until 10pm or later with little to no texts or replies to mine. Once we even had a tornado and the house was left without power in November, and I was heating it with candles. She still went over there that day, and didn’t come back until after dark.\n\nThey did a sexy photoshoot together that I didn’t know about until I saw it on Facebook. Naturally, I was wrong and controlling to be enraged by that. Their next plan was to sit their naked asses in paint and then sit on canvasses together. I asked why everything had to be about nudity and sexuality? Why do I have to take both car seats out for you, you two have to sit beside each other in the back seat? I was being paranoid, of course. I have anxiety, just like my Mom, which earned me the nickname of my Mother’s name when I was feeling anxious. \n\nMy ex found out that her new bestie had been lying to me while we were together. She had told me she no longer did drugs, but had been snorting pills behind my back while I was at work. You would think my wife would take my side and kick her to the curb, but she didn’t. They stayed friends for longer than I care to remember until they finally had a falling out. \n\nEverything spiraled downhill from there. Sex with her became a bill to be paid. Our relationship was ice cold. She bashed everything I loved. Started calling me lazy and a slob (I admit I’m not a neat freak, but I do clean my fucking house) and saying that all I wanted was a live in maid. It didn’t matter what I did; if I mentioned to her that I had done dishes or mopped, she would ask if I wanted a prize. It shouldn’t be something special I did for her, it should just be something I did because I’m an adult. Fair enough, I suppose. \n\nThings start to get fuzzy around here. Memories are more like scenes from movies. I know now, from therapy, that I was in the narcissistic fog. I was so concerned with not setting her off that I wasn’t really living. I would get up before everyone else to play my video games in peace, and of course, have her coffee made and waiting for her. I did the same before work. I got up and got ready first, so she could take her time, and her coffee was waiting. If it wasn’t made, I had to take her to McDonald’s to get coffee. If I was worried that the drive through would make us late for work, I was being paranoid. \n\nAt some point during this time, she began to mention a guy from work (my ex and I work together to this day). I’ll call him Larry. Larry, she said, had been hanging around and going out of his way to see her and speak to her. Finally I asked if she wanted me to say something to him and she said no, it was nothing. As it turns out, I spent about a week working with Larry and he does seem to be a genuinely nice guy. Anyway, remember Larry for later. \n\nAs our marriage limped along, my ex became a feminist. I’m not hating on woman pride, but it gets old hearing how “straight white men cause all the problems in the world and should be killed”.  If she ever left me, she swore she was going full lesbian. She hated men.  But not me, she would then assure me. “You’re one of the good ones.”\n\nWe started racking up debt. She talked me into getting two credit cards to cover Christmases so we could buy big expensive toys for the kids. She convinced me to take out a $10,000 loan to redo the floors in our house. They needed to be replaced, but still— we were spending money like it was falling out of my ass. I would worry about our finances out loud, and can you guess what I was told? To shut up about it if we were in public (can’t hurt our image, can we?) or that I was just being paranoid. When our account went into the negative, it was because I bought too many drinks at work or because of that video game I had bought. \n\nShe began to emasculate me in front of my friends. She told them I couldn’t “get it up for her” and that sex with me was vanilla and boring, although she never did anything for me except allow me to give her an orgasm and then roll over on her back so I could get mine. She wanted me to worship her and fill the room with candles and perfume, every time, but it couldn’t be planned out because that wasn’t sexy. Never mind the jobs and the kids. It wasn’t long before we were sleeping in separate rooms. \n\nThis is when the narcissistic collapse happened. We were arguing about something, and I finally said it. I wanted a divorce. She had a full on meltdown, telling me she wanted to “blow her brains against the ceiling” and then saying that she hated me and that it should be ME that wanted to die, not her. She disappeared into our closet, in the dark, where there were two pistols. I’m here to tell you that walking into that closet was one of the scariest things I’ve ever had to do. I was convinced, at least partly, that we were going to be a murder-suicide story for everyone to watch on YouTube. She asked me to “call someone to help” so I called 911, they came and took her away. \n\nI learned then that she hadn’t been institutionalized for the first time because of satanic music. She had been cutting herself and threatening suicide, and I learned that directly from her mother. Our relationship had literally begun with lies, and she had repeated and maintained them for five years. \n\nWhile she was in the hospital, I was told to gather up anything that could be used to kill me or herself and get them out of the house. I collected knives, hammers, heavy knick-knacks, scissors, and of course the guns. I told my Dad to sell them for all I cared, just get rid of them. I allowed the kids to go to the hospital to see her, and her mom asked me not to divorce her. “I don’t think she can handle it right now.” So I took her back into my home. She cried that she just wanted her husband back, and I took that Hoover hook, line and sinker.  I still slept in my own room, though, and I propped an acoustic guitar against the door in case she opened it while I was sleeping. I was terrified to live with her. She had told my parents that she would ruin me; take my house, the car, the kids, everything. The last thing I wanted to do was have to call 911 again. \n\nFast forward to more recent times. We finally agreed to a dissolution. I wouldn’t kick her and my stepdaughter out of the house— in fact I let her have our old bedroom, which has its own bathroom that my Dad and I REMODELED FROM THE FLOOR UP for her. I should also mention that her birth control was giving her unbelievably bad periods, so I agreed to get a vasectomy. I did that for her. Because I was trying to be a good husband. \n\nShe agreed to pay me rent until she could afford to move out, which was fine with me. I even learned that she had a new boyfriend at work— remember Larry?! I told her that it was totally fine, that I liked the guy and didn’t want to fight him or hurt him. All I asked was that she didn’t rub it in my face. The very next day she came home wearing his shirt, and five years of repressed rage all came out at once. \n\nI flipped our couch and told her that I didn’t want her here. I didn’t want a relationship with her anymore. I wasn’t jealous of Larry because he had something I didn’t want anymore. I said “If anything I should warn him, does he know the real reason you went to the mental institution?” She moved in with her Mom then, and I went to therapy. The healing begins there. \n\nShe’s still extremely unpleasant to deal with. She wanted to fight with me one day so she called MY parents to have them cover to “moderate” and threatened to keep my son from me if I didn’t agree to talk. She tells people that I cheated on her (I’ve never cheated on anyone in my life) and that she checked HERSELF into the hospital to help cope with the death of our dog. \n\nI’m sorry to wrap this up quickly, but typing it has been exhausting. For five years I’ve been questioning myself, questioning my own sanity, questioning my own masculinity and questioning my choices. I apologize for everything. I turn the TV down when my roommate comes home even though he doesn’t give a shit. I feel like I gave her everything a man could possibly give a woman. A home, a child, her own car, tattoos, a custom bathroom, even my ability to make children (although to be fair to her, I don’t want more kids). Now I feel like the woman I fell in love with isn’t just gone, or dead, but never existed in the first place. I feel like a huge chunk of my life is just missing, and now I’m 36 and a single dad. Maybe I will die alone, like she always told me. But as I told her, “Dying alone would be better than being married to you.”\n\nAnyway, that’s my story the best way I can tell it. Feel free to share your story, ask questions, or insult me. I don’t care. This is what happened. I tried to remember everything I could, and of course I’m not a perfect saint. I have a temper, I have anxiety, and I do get jealous.  The problem was that I could admit it, and she could never even bring herself to apologize. Let alone admit she did anything wrong. \n\nI am a survivor of a female covert narcissist, and she did not beat me. ",

Sorry for all the italics but if you only knew everything she’s done to me since I was little. She’s 5 years older. \n\nShe also starts acting nice again at times and this happened again recently. I foolishly opened my heart a tiny bit and WHAM I got a totally confusing and toxic text. That was 5 days ago and I was just calming down from that until an even worse email showed up. \n\nShe’s playing the victim, playing the martyr, and I even just sent her daughter a nice birthday card and present. \n\nOur parents died unexpectedly during Covid 7 months apart. Without my knowledge or permission she moved her grown stepson into my parents (now 1/3 my house) and into their bedroom and took down all of my parents things before I had a chance to visit the house, touch my moms things and say good bye. She took that opportunity and experience away from me. \n\nNow she has the nerve to say how kind she was to me at that time and sent some rent money from him staying there. That I should be grateful or some bs. I never wanted him or his money. I was too kind at that time although I felt devastated. And this is how I get repaid. I’ve written too much but you know what a mess these people make things? Everything with them is weirdly complicated and hard to explain. Thank you for listening and letting me get it out. I feel I’m losing my mind. \n\nTL;DR  My narc sister has torn my heart out, stabbed me in the back, manipulated and betrayed me throughout my life and now she’s saying she’s a victim. ",

Now that we’re officially together, he’s amazing but lately he’s exhibited some of his old habits. He always makes jokes about everything even my feelings. Doesn’t wait for me to get out of the car he says hurry up (jokingly) if i voice that something he does makes me sad or not okay he either patronizes me or really doesn’t acknowledge deeply how things affect me. He’s thrown things out of anger before but never at me or directed at me. We never fight but i think that’s cause we never communicate about our feelings anyway cause he puts a wall up. I love him but i don’t know if this relationship is sustainable if i can’t communicate with him about my feelings. I’m scared to talk to him now about what bothers me because he’s shut it down every time. He does a lot for me but doesn’t go halfway with a lot. I feel i’ve given up my dreams to be with him. if i try to tell him how i feel he ignores me until i changed the subject. i really need help. i feel i deserve more from someone but im scared to breakup as i don’t know if id regret it ",

I don’t have many people in my life I can trust as I have been through a lot of abuse and toxic relationships. He has been through similar experiences as me and often we find solace in each other. Today we got into a fight that is making me reconsider if this friendship is even worth it anymore. He means so much to me but I just can’t wrap my head around someone speaking to me this way when they don’t get what they want…\n\nFor context. A friend of mine is hooking up with an a-list celebrity right now on the DL. I met him in a group of my friends last week and was invited with that same group of friends to spend time at his house tonight. That said, I shared it with my friend because we tell each other everything- especially when it comes to our day to day interactions and experiences.

But it never dawned on me WHAT she truly was and what he was experiencing. As long as he did everything he could for her, when she wanted it..things would be fine. I was naïve then. But I’m aware now.\n\nI ended our friendship a year ago because she had serious issues with my now boyfriend, her brother in law. She wanted us together, but as soon as I started taking interest she would become upset and play victim as if I was intentionally hurting her by spending more time with him, and less with her. \n\nShe also would make posts on Facebook that described the way I made her feel, and would say, “not everything is about you..” when I brought it to her attention.\n\nI tried to make things work, and mend our friendship..but her ability to victimize herself and paint me in such a horrible way was traumatizing for myself. I’m the most empathetic individual, and would never want to hurt anyone intentionally. I was also maneuvering the 13 years of trauma from my CN x husband, and was confused by the way she was treating me.\n\nA few months ago her husband had made a mention he wishes we could work things out. And how rough it has been on her since I’m gone. How poorly her mental health went once I left and how much therapy she needed due to my decision to end our friendship. I realized there was nothing I could do, other than apologize for my actions to get her back, and it wasn’t justified as I’d done nothing to apologize for. But I did feel horrible for how things ended.\n\nI called her, and I cried, I apologized and I asked her to call me so we could talk. She never reached out. Her husband called my boyfriend to see how I was, and to make sure I was okay. He was concerned. But nothing came from her. I text her. I apologized, and poured my heart out to her for the pain I’d caused her. I could understand if she didn’t want to talk to me, but I’d hoped that she wouldn’t be the person I knew she was..and try to make amends. If she were hurting as much as she had, she should be willing to work on our friendship right? Wrong.\n\nShe now calls me “the one who must not be named..” when she refers to me. She spreads lies about me, saying that I murder all of my pets. She still paints me as a horrible person. And I’ve accepted her now, for who she truly is..a narcissist. I don’t spread hate about her, bc at the end of the day she was my best friend..the aunt to my children, and my biggest supporter. I have a love for her that she doesn’t truly understand. Her family was my family. Even after pouring my love to her in a message a year later, she never returned my text or calls. She instead text my boyfriend to hang out with her the next day. She hasn’t spoke to him since our friendship ended either..so it was obvious what was happening.\n\nI’m glad my bf and his brother have a close bond. I hope they always do. And my heart aches for him..bc he truly deserves so much more than he receives. \n\nNever allow others to treat you horribly, or make you feel bad for setting boundaries for yourself. Value yourself, and never let these people take away your happiness. \n",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, I really need to vent and some support please. \n\nMy narc ex just got engaged. I’m not entirely surprised and I have been mentally preparing for this since I found out they were together. For context, his fiancée is someone he has known a long time since we were together and I now wonder whether he always had his eye on her because I feel a weird sense of betrayal even though this relationship is year after ours.\n\nI handled it ok on the day I found out but I’ve been spiraling since. All the emotions and self-doubt he caused me are coming to the surface and I’m in so much hurt right now.\n\nI’ve had the misfortune of having to be at a couple of events socially with them in the past year and felt so uneasy in his presence. I’ve posted about those interactions elsewhere on this thread. They looked so happy and in love, just how I used to be with him. It was crushing and at the same time I literally wanted to run in the opposite direction. \n\nHe’s the kind of narc who is extremely suave, overly polite in a social setting, good looking, educated etc. but there is something sinister about him that I can’t put my finger on other than the uneasy way he makes me now feel. The emotional manipulation was so covert and it shot my self esteem for years more than the relationship lasted for.\n\nPhysically, her appearance is very similar to mine. Like when we got together, they were friends for a long time and part of a same social circle with lots of mutual friends. He has followed this pattern with other girlfriends and that pattern has ended with him changing his mind. For me, that has been some consolation up until now. It just felt like we were a collection of trophies. \n\nHe tried to come back to me multiple times but I eventually turned him down for my own self preservation but am doubting whether I made the right decision. For a long time I felt he was my soul mate and the love of my life. \n\nSeeing he is engaged is so triggering - I accidentally saw a photo of the day on social media from a mutual friend. I feel crushed all over again. Is it possible he has changed and/or this girl has something special that i just didn’t have? Or will he change his mind on his now fiancée just like he did with me and at least 2 others? \n\nIt was a grand gesture proposal followed by a surprise engagement party with friends and family so that makes me think he’s very invested to make it very public like that.\n\nI feel so uneasy thinking about it but I’m so confused because I also feel a sting of regret wondering maybe he wasn’t a narc and was the one that got away? Or is this just my mind playing tricks on me?\n\nAt the same time, I just don’t want him to have his happy ever after!  \n\nJust really struggling with all of this to the point of feeling quite sick to the stomach :((",

        "Text": "Hi Guys! So my mother 63F is a victim of abuse by my Narcisstic grandmother 89F.\n\nBack story : \nMy grandmother was moved out from my uncle's house because of the constant verbal and emotional abuse she was putting my uncle, aunty and children through. \n\nCurrently in elderly facility : \nShe has been placed in an elderly facility for the past 8 months. All grandchildren and other relatives have gone no contact on her. The only two supply left are my mother and uncle. \n\nShe is made to comply to the rules in the facility and cannot dominate and control like what she has been doing for the last 88 years of her life. She is very well behaved in the facility but takes out her anger on my mother and uncle in private when they visit or call her.  \n\nShe was guilt tripping my mother for 6 months to bring her to our house. But we were very firm my grandmother cannot move in with us. She would torment my mother over the phone everyday saying how she is being treated very badly there and guilt trip her saying she has been abandoned by my mother and make her feel like she is not a good daughter. \n\nMother's blood pressure shot up : \nEventually her blood pressure shot to over 200 which required us to bring her to the emergency room. Ever since then my mother has been under high blood pressure medicine. \n\nMy mother was referred to the psychiatrist to get sleeping pills and anxiety medication. We will be starting talk therapy with a counsellor for my mother soon. \n\nMother went NC on grandmother : \nI have a personal psychologist for myself due to the childhood trauma I endured because of all the chaos and mental torture my narcisstic grandmother gave my family.\n\nWhen I consulted my psychologist over this, he said my mother has to go no contact with my narcisstic grandmother. \n\nNC broke : \nWe managed to do that for 1.5 months by blocking my grandmother's number on all our phones. However, my grandmother managed to find a way to call my mother last Friday and blasted at her saying she wants to die and she has been abandoned by my mother and hung up the phone. \n\nEver since then, my mother has been saying she wants to go and see my narcisstic grandmother. We won't be surprised if my grandmother triggers my mother to the extend that she has a cardiac arrest. After all, that's what she wants. To see others suffer. \n\nWe are trying to keep dragging to my mother by saying she can slowly go and see my grandmother when her health gets better as what my psychologist suggested.\n\nMy mum started to develop a fear my grandmother might die and wants to go see her one time. But we all know it won't end at once. Once this cycle starts, it can't be stopped. \n\nUnless my grandmother is on death bed and she is in a state where she really cannot speak, then we intent to bring my mother to go see her mother. Until that, we don't intend to. \n\nMy question is, how do we protect our mother and try to ensure she doesn't go and see her mother? Are there some tips on how we can ensure my mother sticks to the NC rule? \n\nMy mother's life is the most important here and we are last bothered about our grandmother. ",

        "Text": "Just wanted to post my experience in hope to connect with individuals that have had similar experiences. \n\nOver a week ago my partner messaged me stating that they'd fallen in love with someone and that we had to split up. The breaking up aspect wasn't anything new as this would occur often. Any time an argument occured they'd often say it was over. I'd get called every name under the sun made to feel like shit and then they'd just expect me to apologise for everything and it would go back to 'normal'. This break up seems different though. We've never not spoken for this long.\n\nInitial when we'd first met, I thought that they might suffer with autism. It was either black or white, yes or no and nothing in-between. After a certain amount of time a really dark side started to come out. They had really bad anger to the point things were smashed, punches were thrown and my personal items destroyed. We could have been having a normal conversation, if I'd say something slightly wrong or that they didn't agree with they'd snap. Literally out of nowhere. I don't know if it was from past trauma's but it was like they had 2 completely different personalities. The arguments were often about me having friends of the opposite sex. The threats (mostly about ruining my life) got that bad I felt like I had no other option than to completely remove these friends from my life. This was often used against me in every argument that they wanted to have. Repeatedly... Quite early on in the relationship they had started to drink quite excessively. Eventually to the point it was during the day. We didn't live together, so when I'd come round in the early evening it was obviously that they were drunk. Whenever I tried to have a conversation about it, it was always my fault. The things I'd done had caused them to drink. With the drink the anger and arguments just got more and more frequent. It caused my anxiety to go through the roof. I just didn't feel safe. A couple of weeks ago I'd say the smear campaign started. I'm a sole trader so they stared to leave bad reviews on my Google page, they even posted my face on social media belittling me and throwing false allegations out there.\n\nI'd like to say I loved them once, but after the weekly emotional and physical abuse any love I had just disappeared, but I felt trapped. now that I've had a tiny bit of separation all the emotions are coming out. I feel completely broken and void of the person I used to be. After a couple of days of me feeling like it was over I reached out to one of my close friends, someone I had to block. I now have panic attacks just talking to this friend as I feel like my ex is going to find out and start with the threats all over again. It makes me so sad ..\n\nI don't even know if it is narcissism, but after reading up on it it feels very similar. I've felt so isolated for so long, I don't even feel like I can speak to my family due to embarrassment. I had absolutely no closure from this relationship after the way it ended, but I think I'm just going to have to accept that. I'm adamant that I'm not going to reach out. I'm strong. I can do this.\n\nThank you to whoever reads this. I'm sorry if  something similar has happened to you. You didn't deserve any of it.",

I got to work today and opened my work email to find an email from him. Luckily I work for family law attorneys. One of them sent him a cease and desist letter, but I can’t help but feel afraid. I am so afraid of him. And while I hope that letter will flip a switch in his mind, I’m afraid it’s going to awaken a beast in him and it will get worse. ",

We still have to settle the exchange of belongings which is the only reason I have contacted him. When I tried to set healthy boundaries for how and when the exchange would occur he ended up blocking me and now says he is going to bring the issue to court. I just wanted him to give me my things and have him get his things and be done with it. I hate this constant feeling of anxiety about what he will do or say next. I didn't realize how bad the rage could be and wish I had prepared better. What can I do to make it stop? I have thought about an abuse protection order but I don't know if that's the right road to take. How long does this rage last? It has been a month already.",

        "Text": "I don’t know what happened or what to do. I don’t even know how long I can keep this post up, in case it is found. But I am in a situation where I need to leave, finally, because I have been asked to, and I can’t process anything that has happened to me. I don’t know if I need support, resources, or what.  Or is the problem actually me? \n\nIn the relationship I was in, I tried everything. After I moved in, which was on the condition I would keep up certain ends of the bargain: division of labor, saving for vacations, their behavior completely changed. They were angry a lot, which is very triggering for me, and I had to learn to overcome my triggers and accept angry outbursts because that is how they handled frustration. \n\nI had a hard time with finances, and couldn’t save as much as I should have. My career made me tired, anxious, and panicked. Some days I could find support from them, others it was too much. I found myself constantly being belittled for the way I said things or did things. I had to walk on eggshells and be very careful and mindful to make sure I did things exactly as expected and how they wanted things. When I couldn’t meet expectations, I would get yelled at. \n\nSometimes, after arguments or fights, they would come in and act like nothing was wrong and couldn’t understand why I was upset. When I tried to work on things or communicate, they would say there was no room for their feelings in the relationship, only mine. They would say I made no sense when I talked and when I constantly tried to apologize or correct myself, I was lying or gaslighting them. I started to feel so confused and sick that I would do any little thing not to set them off. And sometimes, I think I even got worse because I was so consumed with making sure I was doing everything correctly. If I did or said something wrong, I was demanded to explain my brain process. Which I couldn’t. It sent me down a spiral of panic. \n\nI also had to cook a certain way, and if I didn’t, I was not helping support them in their weight loss journey. I had to stick to all the agreements and plans even when I was struggling. \n\nI went through a job change that hit me financially. They supported me through it. I was also talking to someone and I was doing pretty great with the changes, but at home, they couldn’t see the change and were getting more miserable. \n\nThis weekend, I came back from a late flight and catered to them because they weren’t feeling well. This morning, there was an altercation where they told me to get out of their face and when I asked about a meme they had up on their computer screen, they accused me of invading their privacy and when I said I understood and I was sorry, they said yeah no I don’t and I won’t change the behavior. After this, they took me to lunch and then got mad at my leaving out some important connecting part of a sentence I was explaining on the way back. After that, they came in and broke up with me, said this wasn’t working anymore. \n\nSo I panicked. About where I was going to live and what I was going to do. They tried to say to stay here as long as I want, they want to help me support me. But I feel sick and confused and after all this, nights of endless crying and blaming myself and hating myself, I feel like I’m the one that couldn’t be better or do better. I feel like it’s my fault. I was the one always triggering them and making them frustrated and they would lash out because of that. \n\nAnd I don’t know. I don’t know what I did. Or how to move forward. Or how to feel. Sometimes I question my reality because this person insists I twist things. The crazy thing is, I want to fix it, but I don’t know what’s happening. If I am the problem or what. Any support or advice or help would be amazing. Thank you, friends. I hope this made sense. My brain is all over right now. They say I am deserving of love, respect, all the things…but then why was I treated like this for years? Why did I deserve this? I should also mention, in the beginning of the relationship I was different, I was engaging, I was treated so well, I felt special and listened to…all of the things. The turning point was the second I moved in. \n",

        "Text": "This is my very first post, so my apologies for any format issues.\n\nSo this all began with this girl i met on a dating site, i was really down on my luck at this time (moving apartments, car broke down, freshly moved to CA) point is i had very little money. I really liked talking to this girl and told her my situation, and that in the future when things get better, that id love to take her out on a date. She said something along the lines of \"dont worry! Il pick u up and we can go out for some food/drinks\" this was rare to hear from any women in Los Angeles because most girls expect the man to do that. As guilty as i felt, i allowed her to pick me up and we had an amazing first date.\n\n 4-5 weeks pass and we continue seeing eachother, i finally get back on my feet (new car, new apartment, finally settled) and was able to show her the man i really was. About a month later i asked her to he my girlfriend. Things were great, and when my roomate at the time decided to abandon the lease, I had to move out. Luckily she was able to ask her parents to let me move in to their back house. I was skeptical at first because i hadnt even met her parents. Once i met them, they let me move in. I was grateful because now i had a roof over my head, and a beautiful girlfriend by my side. Things went on great for about a year, then things started to go down hill.\n\n It all started with jealousy of who i follow/work with on social media (im a videographer/photographer who occasionally has to work with female clients) It first became an issue of who i was following, then it became an issue of ANY girl i was following. She would look at my messages between the clients on Instagram, and would consider it \"flirting\" when i was simply trying to gain work. She finally had enough and gave me an ultimatum, which was delete all my socials or break up... I obviously didnt want to lose either my girlfriend or my hobbie/passion/career... so i got rid of the only way of making new clients. \n\nFor a while this worked, but months later it became another thing. Thought i was deleting texts, cheating, being a creep, still using social media and more. One night we got into a really heated argument while i was working on a video for client. She stormed into my room, grabbed my macbook laptop, and snapped it in half before putting it under water in the bath tub. We were finally able to calm down and as much as i was pissed, i just wanted to calm her down, hoping she would acknowledge her damage. Instead she essentially said \"i deserve this\" for the way i treat her. \n\nShe expects A LOT from me.. flowers every 2 weeks, brunch or dinner once a week, expensive designer clothes on birthdays, buying things we dont need but blaming it on me. She even renovated my entire appartment into a place where my opinion didnt matter. \n\nMe:\"Maybe we can move the shelf here?\"\nHer:\"No, i bought it so i choose\"\n \nI financially couldnt maintin this lifestyle and even explained that if i work two jobs, i could do more of those things.. well turns out getting two jobs is out of the question because she thinks i will flirt with other people. Once we got past that argument, another one happened weeks later about the same issue, except this time she slapped me multiple times (hard enough to make my vision blurry) and pushed my head into the wall. She also took more of my electronics and put them into the bath tub too... she continues to threaten to destroy my car, having me jumped/beatup or let my indoor cat free. I worry constantly about her doing more physical harm and although she has shown only a little of that, im unsure if these are empty threats. \n\nIm scared to find out and as of the past week, I finally made the decision to let me mom know what's going on. She was shocked because she met her before and she was so sweet, but when i explained everything she was heart broken. She thinks i should come home while i recover from this, and focus on myself instead of deal with this. She told me this is abuse, but as a man I feel weak to not do anything. I would never lay a finger on her but that doesnt make it right for her to?\n\nI finally had a conversation with her and told her, i understand what you feel and why you feel it, but I will not allow myself to he physically threatened or hurt, none the less my cat or possessions. She tried to downplay the slaps and say \"wooowww, 5 slaps? For everything u put me through, you deserve that\" im at the point where I think i need to pack my bags, get my cat, and drive across country back home with family who i know will support me in this difficult time (i have no family or real friends in LA) I think i know what the answer is, but for some reason i still want to make this work. \n\nI love this girl but i dont love the way shes been acting or treating me. Im affraid that one day if we have kids, she will treat them the same way. I think i know the answer is to leave and never look back, but how do i pretened like the last 5 years (since i moved to LA) are now a waste because of a girl i fell in love with. \n\nWhat would you do in my shoes?\n\nSincerely, a really lost man",

I just want to list out some of his behavior because I am really confused right now. \n\n1. When I would cry about my insecurities he would get upset/ignore me and sometimes tell me I’m crying too loud.\n\n2.

He stated everything he didn’t like about my appearance but then said it wasn’t true .\n\n3. I pay for a lot of my own stuff and we split bills and rent , but almost every other week he’s texting me saying that he doesn’t think our financial situation is fair bc he feels he’s paying for everything.\n\n4. He will stonewall me during an argument and go on his phone or just won’t say anything reassuring \n\nHe’s not all bad though but these things have severely messed with my self esteem. I’m not sure if it’s all In my head though. He has expressed that before I got into treatment , my behavior was really bad which led him to look at other women. Sometimes I do wonder though if his lack of reassurance and respect for me led to a lot of my bpd breakdowns but he has never taken accountability for anything. ",

But, he keeps finding different ways to contact me. He’s iMessage emailed me, actually emailed me, sent money through cash app with a message. And he’s been doing the same thing to my best friend. So, he can get to me. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with him and every time I tried to leave he would get angry and throw my keys. He would get in my face. He would tell me “the relationship isn’t over until I say it’s over.”. Or he’ll say “you leave when I say you can leave”. So, I knew the only way I could leave is to go when he’s at work. And that’s what I did. After that it’s been hell. He shows up at my moms house with small stuff he could’ve thrown away. Or he’ll show up with flowers and leave them on my door. He’s been to my job and I had to get security. But this just happened yesterday. I was coming home from the store at night yesterday. I noticed a vehicle was following me. Once I realized it was his car I panicked. I even tried to turn down the wrong street to be for certain I was being followed. And indeed I was . Because he tried to follow me. I’m in the neighborhood almost home and I remembered my uncle was sitting outside so I sped home in hopes it would scare my ex off. But, my uncle was gone and my heart sank. I made a u turn and drove off.  He chased after me and cut me off. I swerved and parked my car. I watched as he got out. And he came to my window .He said he wanted his grandmas gold necklace back. I looked in my center console while he watched me with the window up and I told him I couldn’t find it. And he told me to check one more area I did and told him i didn’t have it. He told me to roll down the window and when I refused he cursed me out and punched my side mirror and sped off. I called the 911 but since he was already gone they couldn’t do anything. I also got a protective order but since I didn’t have the certified copy they couldn’t help me. I even called his mom so she could talk to him. But she had no sympathy for me at all. Almost like she didn’t care. She texted me to say she talked to him and to drop the restraining order because he’ll leave me alone. I don’t believe that. I’m scared and I’m not sure if the protective order will just get him to find new ways to get me",

I was tired of hearing it, so after they left and he said it one more time, i said \"im sick and tired of hearing about it, its your table, its yours not mine i will not be using it. im going to bed\" didnt think it was a problem. 10 minutes later, it was VERY CLEAR it was a problem. he started to get shitty, short and rude. his whole vibe changed, his aura changed. he got dark and it was like a fucking 180 turn in seconds. i was brushing my teeth when he came in, i immediately asked if he was ok, his answer was short and cold. i knew that something was a miss. i froze in the bathroom, i couldnt talk. i couldnt move, i literally forgot how to function. i got really cold and i started going through every single action, words spoke to find out where i went wrong. i went through everything thinking something that didnt involve me happened. asked if everything went ok when he went with his dad to the store. i asked if he was ok i did all the things to go through the list of things so i can pinpoint it.\n\nbut no. that didnt work. nothing worked. he finally said something. and when he told me he was upset with how i reacted to his attempt to use his table for the 2975 time that night, it turned around and was my fault that he was upset. he was being an asshole, said such, and he called me a bitch. mind you we were in bed. i got up and got my pillow, went to the couch. he followed me and yelled and was being unpleasant. and my heart is racing as im sitting (rather laying) taking it. his yelling at me, i didnt respond, i just laid there until he was done. he went back to the bedroom, and i took a good 20 min to calm down. did the dishes, putted around the living room trying to get my heart to stop racing. did things to keep busy incase he decided to get back up and come back at me. he did. when i went back in there to gauge how he was and if i could possibly sleep in the bed, it started again. he keeps telling me im not hearing him, im not listening. and when that happens its usually something else. its monday, hes worried about work and all they are putting on him. hes worried about his birthday, his this, his that, his everything. and i just have to take it whenever he gives it. im just really sick and tired of the mixed signals. and how fast that was. he was fine when his dad was there, touching me and talking to me and everything was fine. they leave and boom. im being attacked over something so small.\n\ni eventually ended up sleeping in the bed, on the very edge, in all my clothes (thanks fight or flight) as far away from him as possible, and woke to every sound and movement. just in case. he said bye like usual and give me a kiss and left. i know that it will bleed into today. we wont talk all day, and when he gets home it will be the same thing, except probably worse cause my son is here now. a continuation of his discontent, and his anger. i get to deal with it. i get to try and maintain my anger, and hurt while hes doing this, try to keep it away from my son, because if i dont, who knows whats going to happen. its all so very tiring being so confused, thinking maybe i am the problem, maybe hes fine. im tired of feeling like i need to pack a bag, im tired of feeling so incredibly insecure with someone i tied myself to, someone who was suppose to be my everything. is not and is now just a massive tense volcano and no help or relation to me. i feel like i am nothing more and more. well, something just nothing good.\n\nwhat is this? what am i dealing with?",

By the way I didn't go looking for this info, he forcefully spoon-fed this info to me when he picked up our son last week(y'all know how that goes.) I was telling my best friend I assume the new supply's pregnancy won't be any different from my horrid experience and all I can do is pray that she has a village to lean on because he will be emotionally and financially unavailable. And my best friend started talking about potential and how things could be different because he's having twins and because their living together he may feel more obligated to help because its more then one child. I'm not upset with my best friend, I'm just upset because that comment made me realize that I'm the only person in the world who has the unfortunate pleasure of knowing him so god damn well. It's been 3 years since I've left him and I'm a completely different person. I know my work isn't done but I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. I don't want to make it seem like my son's dad is exempt from growth but his actions don't align with someone who wants to be a better person. Therefore, I think this way. In the past, potential robbed me of so much time and I'm just never going to be his cheerleader ever again. Our son didn't change him as a person, and I doubt him him having 2 more kids will.",

My first ex-boyfriend, from 17-27, who was a clinically diagnosed narcissist who ended up incarcerated (and diagnosed with NPD after our break up) and was very physically abusive and cheated chronically. He received court mandated sessions. He was a perfect gentleman, charmed everyone including my friends, but was horribly abusive.\n\nI confided in a friend who I dated next. He was incredibly sweet and understanding for 2.5 years.\n\nWe ended up living together for the past few months, with me paying 1/3 of the expenses, as I was staying with him and I wanted to help with some bills. I even tried to plan exciting trips, outings to sports events, find new restaurants and so forth. None of this seemed to matter, as he became increasingly critical of me, calling me names, pointing out my flaws, and criticizing everything down to me not choosing a good ride at a theme park (that I paid for as something fun to do) and for me making \"ready meals\" or ordering in at times. For the record, I have a very demanding job and work 80 hour weeks and was still trying to plan these trips, clean, and provide food, even if it is just a warmed up dish.\n\nI did have a therapy session where I thought I was alone as he was working and I vented a bit. I didn't say anything crazy, just that I was feeling financially manipulated (which I haven't in our relationship before) and that I was feeling insecure that my partner stopped sharing his location, got a new phone number, and had some weird missed calls. I think he ended up overhearing this and went through my laptop (iMessages were off) and then told me calmly that night he would be blocking me and I would need to leave. He asked me to tidy up some of my things (I had maybe a straightening iron and a few shirts in the apartment) and I put them in a box. Mind you, I had a ticket for that weekend to go home and he asked me to leave early. He kissed me at the airport, acted completely fine, then blocked me. I know because I texted from my work line and the texts went through.\n\nHe has blocked my numbers as a power play and I truly have no way to reach him. I am out of state, as I moved for him, and alone from my family. This man essentially love bombed me and switched up once I found out he was on dating apps.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't even know about the items, I just can't go through this again. \n\n",

I don't want to justify why I stayed until he made the decision to discard but he literally pushed me out the door one day and has pretended since then that we were never in a relationship and we're \"just friends.\" We met because we both take part in a weekly community fitness event and I am definitely going to continue.\n\nI love our mutual friends there to death and they are some of the most important people in my life right now, sweet and supportive. He seemed anxious that they never find out we were in a relationship in the first place but I didn't want to play that game and they are aware. They love him too, he's a great guy in that environment and I have no desire to hurt that experience for him or for our friends. But he did some appalling things, sexually and otherwise, and I don't want to pretend along with him that we're friends. I'm also not willing to walk away from all of the people I love and care about just to not be around him.\n\nStrategies for sharing that space without making him upset and feel he needs to publicly put me down? In your experience, will narcissistic people realize it makes them look bad to put down mutual friends? He bad-mouths his ex-wife a lot with them, which was a big red flag to me, but he gets a lot of sympathy from them. He maintains a friendship with me on the social media app where we all support each other's athletic activities. I'm a little worried that cutting him off will piss him off, he's very controlling. Advice - can I safely end his pretense that we are friends without him bad-mouthing me to our mutual friends?",

I have been in therapy but my therapist hasn’t been very guiding, and I’ve been hiding inside of myself for so long that I need guidance, I cannot just walk in there and start talking about it because I hardly remember anything and don’t really even know how it’s affected me. I requested EMDR therapy and just met with the lady for the first time a couple of days ago and am already feeling some things come up even though we haven’t started the actual processing. \n\nBasically my question or rather my thought is, sometimes I think the abuse isn’t what ruined me, it’s the lying and pretending and faking I did around people I love for so long that’s ultimately changed me. I learned to pretend for so long that I am so disconnected with myself, others, and the world. I have so much guilt and shame around a few specific friends because they hated that I was with this man and went back to him so many times, that I just feel that emotional wall up and I know it’s my fault. I don’t even know where to begin opening up about this because there is not a single person in my life who knows the extent of the abuse. I’m hoping the EMDR will help me, but I just need to hear others experiences and advices. This is heavy on my mind today, usually I just shove it down and don’t let myself think about it. \n\nEDIT: actually I don’t shove it down, I think about it so often that it causes even more anxiety and shame around these friends.

        "Text": "\nWas homeless, reunited with an old acquaintance randomly who offered a place to stay, ended up becoming intimate, relationship was great at first, moved my stuff in, life finally getting back on track and I've cleaned up got assistance and working consistently, her mood and view towards the relationship started to falter noticeably, she started to hold my stuff hostage and kick me out of the house for minor disagreements and mistakes leading me to perpetually walk on eggshells as to not upset her and get kicked out, disappears for days at a time leaving me locked out of the house with no contact and even sometimes blocking me and no explanation when she returns, tells me she is pregnant, she comes back super happy and giving me gifts and lots of love, randomly stops being affectionate and the cycle begins again: insults/hitting/degradation/public humiliation > kick out > disappears > returns super lovingly and affectionate, became increasingly aggressive, viscously insulting me and touching me inappropriately (slapping, punching, butt grabbing, etc.), constantly humiliating me and degrading me, constantly comparing me to other men and says she wants to be friends and that she would get an abortion, still cuddles me at night in bed and tells me she loves me whenever I leave for work in the mornings, no sex, very rare kiss and hug...etc. etc.\n\nToday, left the house on \"good time\". So while things are good I am reaching out. She was all over me last night, kept moving my hand to her crotch to rub her p---y and butt and throughout the night kept waking me up to push her butt against my crotch. No sex, just intimate touching, she even put her face all over my crotch, kissed me as well, could not stop touching me all night. Though a part of me feels it was \"narc abuse\" to keep me from getting a good nights rest since I told her I had an appointment early. This morning, \"make sure to eat breakfast!\" and \"I love you!\" as I leave. Doubt it...this is a crazy kind of love if I've ever known love.\n\nCurrently at work, only 'free time' I have. If I alter my routine she gets extremely suspicious and it starts a one-sided argument where I have to listen to everything she is saying no matter how wrong it is and if I speak up for myself or do anything other than agree with everything I get kicked out. Last night was scary, it almost seemed like she was about to flip out and she was calling me a re--rd but I just laughed it off. She kept saying \"it's not funny\" but I didn't know how else to react. No reaction? Not listening. React upset? Stop being a little bitch. Etc. We eventually moved on and watched a movie which she kept skipping ahead by 30 secs > minute at a time then going \"I don't get what's going on\". I didn't dare tell her why she couldn't understand, I just went along with her discontent. Finally the movie ended and we layed down to sleep (which is when the affection started).\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has a son, 5 years old, and she is pregnant about a month or two with my child. Doesn't involve me in any of her appointments, and I'm afraid to forcefully do it and get kicked out. Definitely not going to suggest terminating the pregnancy despite her claiming she would, because I cannot trust a thing she says. If I suggest termination and it triggers her, I screw myself over. However I am also aware that I could ask her for termination and she just goes through with it and all my troubles disappear and it's like I finally just woke up from a nightmare and can get back on track with my life.\n\nTrying to get advice on what to do and secure myself before I take any actions. Don't want to kick the hornets nest before I've set up a safety net for myself. I have food stamps and a stable income source now as well as two individuals willing to let me move in...but you know, I'm reluctant to move in with anyone else until absolutely necessary for obvious reasons. Going to need therapy after this.\n\nHer son already has been taken, she has not had him for 2 years so far and goes to court every week or so(?) for it. She visits him once or twice a week. I don't have much information about it other than every Friday and...Monday? she visits him. Turns out she isn't allowed around kids without supervision, not even her little sister. What could that possibly be? She says someone called DCF (child protection) on her because her son was outside naked by himself one day. But would they keep a child from someone for 2 years for such a simple mistake and also not allow her to be around other kids? Something doesn't add up, I don't have enough information. Possible she is lying. She has mental issues (part of her regaining custody of her son is taking bipolar meds and drug tests). Do not want her birthing my child, being near my child at all. She admitted to smoking weed during the first few weeks of the pregnancy (our child) and that she isn't going to care for our child and will give all the affection to her son. Also she used to do cocaine but says she stopped. I think I believe her. I got it all on audio recording as well as a lot of the abuse and her admission that she \"trapped\" me and just pretended to want to be with me.\n\nToo bad that since I don't want to get kicked out again I have to be extremely careful when recording, which means when she goes off on one of her tirades I usually only catch the more mellow tail end of it and it is only audio recording with no video, however I have happened to catch some really damning things and our text messages show a cycle of love > hate > kick out > let back, etc.\n\nI've been keeping my composure but every day it gets harder to pretend I love this woman and want to escape. Laying down next to her every night is excruciatingly painful for me and all I can do is hope I get a good nights rest and GTFO in the morning to work without any incidents.\n\nI wanted to chalk it up as pregnacy hormones but after reading tons of anecdotes, comments, and articles about the subject I fear to say this goes far beyond that.  She wont even admit she has any issues so she doesn't want to see a doctor about it and would rather use her home remedies to cure herself.\n\nDon't need emotional advice, I'll get therapy after this is all over. Just need objective advice on what to do next to protect myself.\n\nThanks for reading and hearing me out.",

It sounds silly but I feel like narcissism has become this big thing this past year due to TikTok etc and it’s thrown around everywhere when someone treats someone even slightly badly. All my close friends and family say this man I have just split up with was a narcissist. Was it that or does he have some other kind of personality disorder going on? Just searching for answers to help myself realise what has gone on and how I heal from this. \n\nI could write here for hours about what happened in our relationship but to sum it up…\n\nIt always seemed very strict rules for me, whilst he made his own up as he went along. I felt like I was to blame for everything. He would hurt me, I would call him out and somehow the conversation would always end with me apologising for hurting his feelings in the way I called him out. I would break up with him for things and somehow he’d reel me back in, constant emails begging for a response, 50 no caller IDs, feeling sorry for him because he had no one else and he loves me so much and he needs me and all that rubbish. I believed it and went back every time, no matter what, just for the same situations to keep on happening. In these times I’d left him after he’d done something to hurt me, he would talk to various different women and I’d find out and again call him out and he would turn it back on me and that he’d never have done it if I didn’t keep leaving him or trying to argue with him. He was doing it out of hurt and loneliness that he’d lost me and couldn’t handle the pain. \n\nI feel like he was constantly hurting me, crossing boundaries, lying to me, letting me down. But whatever he did was never the problem, I was the problem when I said his behaviour wasn’t ok. \n\nHe would tell me how evil I am, how no one would want me when they see how crazy I am, he’s never met a woman so horrible before and nobody has treated him this badly. Then I’d walk away, but he’d beg for me back and say he’d never loved anyone like this and I’m amazing? \n\nI let the man live in my house for free, I fed him, clothed him, leant him my car whenever he needed, leant him money all the time. I know in my heart I couldn’t have treated this man better, but I just feel like nothing I could have ever done would have ever been enough. I’ve been running on empty just to make this man happy all this time. \n\nThe relationship has finally ended for good I think, and hope! And now I’m kind of just feeling like I am insane, how did I let this happen? Is he a narcissist? Was I the problem? Am I really just crazy and argumentative like he made me out to be? \n\nSometimes I sit and think, maybe I shouldn’t have said that to him? Maybe if I didn’t tell him he hurt me, we’d have had a nice day together I wouldn’t have ruined it? Maybe if I didn’t see my friends that day then he wouldn’t have been in a mood when I got home? If I just miss this one night out, it’ll avoid him feeling insecure and saying I’m going to cheat on him? I feel like everything I’ve done this whole time I’ve tiptoed around him and how the choices I’m making will make him feel or react. \n\nI feel like I’m in a permanent state of confusion at the events of the past year or so and trying to work out what he is and how it happened and if it’s my fault. \n\nI’ve had bad relationships in the past, and I’ve never had a problem walking away from them. How am I so naive to have let this happen to me? I loved this guy more than I’ve ever loved anyone but was also fully aware how much he was hurting me, it’s like my mind wanted out but my heart and body would never have let me leave him. Even now typing out how badly he treated me, I sit missing him and wondering if he’s ok and what he’s up to. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is this what narcissist abuse is? ",

(Perhaps it’s something I say..but that’s aside the point.) You hit a total low before you recognize the abuse. Next follows sadness. Anger. Then acceptance and healing. I’m accepting in one day. So I suppose next comes the healing. But as I’m still trying to process all of this so quickly, I’m seeing cracks in his foundation built on lies and deception.\n\nFirstly, his ability to come across as such a generous and caring man. The sweet gestures during the love bombing phase that slowly became few and father between.\n\nHis ability to manipulate me by taking in all of the details on my traumas and triggers, to eventually slowly use them against us. (I have kids) He’d set off a trigger through his actions or behaviors and I’d spiral into disparity. I’d blame my trauma and it would spiral my mental state. He was my “safe space” offering so much emotional support and stability that I couldn’t fathom him being a narcissist. But I always came back to the same conclusion..id eventually apologize to him for my reactions from my trauma. And self shame myself for my trauma responses. Not to mention he’d always say, “I love you. I’m the same person I’ve always been..and I want nothing but safety and security for you and the kids.”\n\nHe would literally talk about work in full detail for hours. He works for a largely known moving company and works on their semi trucks. At first it was sweet to see how enthusiastic and knowledgeable he was about his job. But believe I’m an undiagnosed ADDer..I can’t keep focus, remember things, and my mind drifts easily. I would drift off mentally. He’d eventually make mention on how I never listened to him. I have no clue what you were even talking about..literally..to be able to hold a conversation lol. But deep down I felt horrible for it..I blamed myself. Started hating myself for it. \n\nHe at one point started going into work earlier than usual, going on road calls during his breaks, and had to work over more often. It was conveniently on the same days each week. When I finally caught on to what was happening he got ANGRY with me and told me that he could prove his innocence with time logs from work. I eventually broke down and apologized. I’m still convinced he’s sleeping around on me now. (Never seen those logs btw)\n\nHe once told me the last time he was sick that he thought he was dying of cancer. I have literally nothing more to say about that.\n\nHe hasn’t gotten me anything for holidays, Mother’s Day, my birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day. But then got upset because I didn’t make him feel special on his birthday. I felt devastated. He used the e cause we couldn’t afford most of anything..which was why he didn’t get me anything..but expected something from me. Looking back, I know he’s talking physically. Because he told me this year, that’s all he wants from me..is me in a bow.   I want to puke bc his birthday is at the end of the month.\n\nHe had shown me videos that he had stored in his phone, and laptop of women he’d been with. He admitted he’d record them without their knowledge. He showed me an alarm clock camera that he claimed he use. He admitted he would use it to make sure his exs daughter didn’t “steal” but it was clear what he was using it for. He had hundreds of photos and videos. I watched him delete them when I brought up how uncomfortable it made me fell. He obliged..but realistically, I think he still has them. \n\nHe once showed me a video of his ex girlfriend. Made me watch several times. When I got upset he said that he wasn’t sure what I was into, and apologized. He also forced himself on me once, and claimed he didn’t..I almost forgot this. Bc it never happened again.\n\nMy final breaking point was yesterday. I’d ignored all red flags bc he was an old trusted friend. He fed me what I needed during a very vulnerable point in my life. I never anticipated a relationship with him at all. So how I got to this point is still bizarre to me. But I’m definitely aware. Accept and want to get myself and my kids away from this monster of a human.",

        "Text": "Primarily i'm writing this out as a declaration not ever to be abused again by this friend i'll call \"Roman\".  He's covert narc, so slipped under my radar for a long time.\n\nTW: Mentions of abuse.\n\nI've known this older man for about five years, and he comes over to see me usually every week. We're just friends and he'd tell me about his extensive medical conditions and life challenges for hours each time. Because i care about him, i'll listen and fix him something to eat.\n\nOver time, i tried to overlook some behaviors. Roman found out that when i was in the \"marriage\" with my nex, there was extreme abuse while driving and this is a real trigger. So, when he drove me to pick up my new housemate a few years ago, he drove way too fast along a curvy hilly road. I repeatedly begged him to slow down and finally was trying hard not to cry. He gave a chuckle and turned up the music. I was shocked, but thought he's so poorly all the time-- why would he do it on purpose?That ride felt like it went on forever with me gripping the door and \"braking\" with my feet. I vowed NEVER to drive any distance with him again.\n\nI'd begun noticing other things, such as on my birthday, he showed up with special gifts for my housemate and nothing for me. I thought maybe it was coincidence, but it upset her, and she reminded him it was my birthday, to which he said little.\n\nIf anything is mentioned about someone else going through a hard time, he always tops it with his own terrible circumstances. He's always needy but doesn't want anyone else to need anything from him.\n\nI've tried to turn my back on our friendship, but he's always managed to keep it going by making me feel sorry for him. But this latest was the worst. \n\nFor months, he'd let me know he was going shopping at a nearby store after leaving here and ask if i needed to go. I turned him down many times, but a few weeks ago, agreed since the store is only a mile away. My road can be as busy as a highway, with fast vehicles at times of the day. I live on a hill, so caution needs to be taken getting onto it.\n\nThe first night i agreed, Roman pulled forward along the side of the road, facing the oncoming lane. Instead of waiting there offroad to make sure nothing was coming up the hill, he pulled halfway into the lane, with my side exposed. Suddenly a car came into view, and he just sat there, doing nothing. I was frozen with shock and fear and the car finally swerved and went into the oncoming lane to get around. Roman said nothing and i was numb. I thought maybe he'd just misjudged because SURELY he hadn't done that on purpose?!\n\nThen a few days ago Roman was here, he again asked me. I did need a couple items. It was foggy as Roman pulled forward along the side, i saw beams in the fog approaching, so i told him someone's coming. Instead of waiting, he pulled halfway into the oncoming lane again. This time a large fast truck came zooming towards my half of the car. I screamed Get Over, Get Over, and i don't know if it was at the truck or Roman. The driver kept coming right at us and put his high beams on, only veering over at the last moment. Omg....if a car had been coming from the other direction, there could've been a three-car accident right there. \n\nAgain, i felt completely numb, and this time things happened at the grocery store as well which i won't go into except to say that Roman acted mad at ME and zoomed way ahead with his cart as we were returning to his car. I forced myself not to speed up no matter how far ahead he got. \n\nWhen i got back home, the full impact of what had happened hit me and i became angry.  Roman wanted to frighten me and it could have resulted in serious injury or worse. A real friend would never do that. I vowed NEVER to get into his car again no matter what. What he did to me was highly dangerous and cruel no matter how weak he portrays himself! Because of things i've been through in my life, maybe it's not easy setting boundaries or recognizing abuse for what it is, but this time, i'm going to look out for myself.\n\nALL of us as survivors deserve respect and to be treated with love.\n\nIf anyone has been through similar, please feel free to share.\n\n",

        "Upvotes": 12,
        "Text": "It's been just over a month since I got out of a relationship with my ex, and I suspect that he is a narcissist. There is definitely something pathological going on. Here are the red flags in the relationship:\n\n- The relationship ended for several reasons, but one is that he cheated. He lied to multiple women with seemingly **zero** guilt. He had a two year girlfriend he moved in with just days after he asked me to be his girlfriend, unbeknownst to me. He pressured both of us for unprotected sex and tried to get us pregnant (the 2 year gf found out she's pregnant a few days after the affair was exposed). He's been cheating on the 2 year girlfriend for their entire relationship, and he told the other women he slept with that he was single when he was hooking up with them. He continued to lie and talk to them on social media every once in a while, even after they stopped sleeping with him.\n\n- General selfishness: for his birthday, I went all out, planned everything weeks in advance, and asked for his input so that I knew it would be something he liked. I spent over $200, and he ended up canceling his attendance to the event claiming to be \"sick\" even though the tickets were no -refundable, only for me to find out later that it was because he ended up having a conflict and didn't want his other gf to catch him cheating. For my birthday months later, I told him ahead of time what I wanted because he never asked. Instead of doing the activity I wanted, he planned a day at the beach because HE wanted to go. I suspect that he also chose that so he could ogle naked women in bikinis - on my birthday.\n\n- Superficial conversations. He starved me of emotional intimacy, and I felt like I never got to know him beyond the surface level. He never asked me deep questions and appeared to be more concerned with \"having fun\" and using my body than he did connecting on a deeper level or being vulnerable.\n\n- Told me that I was overreacting for being upset about all of the lies, exploitation, and infidelity. He said that he did something morally wrong, but not illegal and that I was acting crazy\n\n- A *constant* need for validation. He would interrupt my work day to tell me about the things he did right at his job or the praise he got, even though he's a man in his mid thirties. He would also send me shirtless photos and entire videos of himself working out at the gym and flexing. It got so bad that if I didn't immediately shower him with praise for how muscular and strong he is, he would spam my professional email with pics and photos of himself using his professional email\n\n- A constant liar. He would make what I now know are b.s. excuses when he had to reschedule dates, claiming to be sick or busy with work. Even when he got caught red handed in the midst of the affair, he didn't disclose the other women to the 2 year gilfriend (or me, I found out by doing my own investigation bc he lied that there were other women involved). He also tried to tell her we only had sex twice and argued with me in front of her, trying to gaslight me out of the reality that we had sex multiple times over six months...\n\n- A lack of empathy. I told him early on that I had been SA'd in the past because he pressured me for sex very early on (and he's extremely hypersexual) but he didn't seem to care, continued to pressure me, and eventually took advantage of me when he decided he had waited too long.\n\n- A general sense of entitlement. He was a Karen sometimes when we would go places and I had to calm him down. \n\n- Once I exposed his secrets to his family and friends on social media, he blocked me and discarded me with the quickness 😂 guess that's what happens when they feel shame for the truth being brought to light and you no longer acting as their ego supply\n\n- He then reported me to the police for telling his friends and family he's a lying, predatory cheater and claimed that it's \"abuse\". It was painfully obvious that he cared more about his fake persona being called out on social media than he did the real and extensive harm and trauma he caused me and his other 2year girlfriend. The police threw out his complaint, obviously - telling your friends and family that you're a cheater isn't illegal 🙄 \n\nDoes this sound like the typical narcissist prototype to you guys?",

        "Text": "I’ve been in a relationship for over a year with someone I’ve known for a long time. He kind of came back into my life around the time I left my covert narcissist husband of 13 years. I was out for several months and living with my narcissistic and unsupportive parents. I was trying to navigate life and had no plans to move on, definitely not as soon as I had. I trusted him. My job let me go after returning from an LOA..and I was trying to navigate independence while dealing with the torment from home. He suggested we get a place together, focus on my healing and enjoy my kids. I was hesitant..and considered the options..but the love bombing clouded my intuition, and I agreed. \n\nWe’ve been together for over a year. I don’t have income, my bank account closed, I’m sinking in debt from my marriage. My credit was drug before the marriage, but when my partner and I discussed finances, we felt filing for bankruptcy after the dissolution was finalized would give me a fresh start. I left the majority of my belongings with my Nex husband, because I was planning on getting my own furniture etc. but since moving in with him, i wasn’t overly concerned because he had his own furniture. I don’t have a bed, couch, tv. I have beds for my kids, cooking utensils and some clothing. \n\nI no longer have contact with the outside world. I went no contact with my parents and family. I left the few friends I did have with my marriage and job. None of them were supportive, and one was narcissistic themselves. I’ve mentioned getting a job to my partner, and he says I’ll loose all assistance for my children and putting miles on my car isn’t good. He’s right. My vehicle was turned over about 7 months into our relationship..it was a lemon purchased after my ex had a vehicle repossessed and hone foreclosed on. It cost more to fix than the car was worth. So I’m left with my 15 year old car, that’s breaking down. He says we can’t afford to fix the cars, which is also why we don’t go anywhere or do anything with the kids.\n\nMy assistance is getting cut in half since my ex is finally filing for the dissolution. He’s not paying child support. And he claims one while I claim the other. I’ll be responsible for more than I can afford even with constant work..\n\nI feel so alone. And so trapped. And I’m confused..where do I go, what do I do? I’m fighting a silent war. I know I need to leave him but have nothing to my name.\n\nMy intuition has been warning me for a while that he’s a narcissist. I’ve chalked it all up to my trauma and triggers. But over time his mask is slipping, and I’ve grown exhausted of gaslighting my gut feelings. I’m sure I’ll be hovered and disregard my feelings and this will come up again in a few months. It’s a cycle that hasn’t ended..and I realize it’s the cycle of abuse and it’s never going to just go away.\n\nToday I made a mention of my son taking things from school. He just ignored me. When I brought up that I feel he doesn’t care..he snapped at me and said he doesn’t know what to even do about my son. It didn’t feel right that he reacted with defense and frustration due to something so minor. When I tried to express that I feel I’m raising my kids alone, and that they don’t have a close bond…he reacted aggressively as if I were attacking him. I wasn’t trying to. I wanted to e press my feelings in hopes we could work through it. He told me he felt attacked. And asked me what I thought he should do..I shut down. I sobbed silently, and he did nothing to show empathy. I’ve been discarded..and feel I have no way to escape this narcissistic hell. \n\n\nI need help..and don’t know where to start.",

        "Text": "Hi 👋🏻,\nTrigger warning ⚠️ talking about abuse\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nI think my husbands ex might be a covert narcissist. We've been together for 10 years and I've never fully understood her behavior. She's very passive aggressive, makes very snide comments, when we first moved in together she was making up stuff about me like that I let my kid hit hers and seems to struggle in her personal life as well which is kind of what's leading me to think it's actually a PD as opposed to just not liking me and ex, she has never worked and relies on her parents (in their 70s now) to financially support her but then puts a lot of blame on them as well as my husband and probably myself for why her life isn't going well. Stepkids live with us. Basically she was being violent to them but blaming depression, anxiety, and stress. When the kids told us stuff and husband asked her she would always admit it which is why I was like oh ok it's probably not NPD but this summer while visiting with her stepkid tried to talk about how exs behavior and outbursts effected her and caused her some trauma. This was a conversation she wanted to have because her therapist suggested it might bring her closure and help her heal. Instead ex told her \"I never did that to you\" \"I never hit you, I never caused you trauma, it wasn't as bad as your remembering your dad and new wife are just exaggerating\" It kinda clicked like this is stereotypical narcissistic behavior if she's refusing to apologize and denying any wrong doing to the person she hurt. I have text messages between her and ex where she admitted to being physical with them and told him she thought they should stay with us. I recently found out she tells people we made her give us the kids. I've personally had her blocked on everything for the past 3 years and don't communicate with her because she always gets defensive and turns everything around to be how I'm causing problems so I basically gave up and was like not my circus not my monkey. But my main issue is how do I help the kids through her denial of how she treated them? All I said was \"well if you remember what happened and how it effected you that's your truth and reality. You can't make people apologize\" but I feel like it's not enough. Oldest stepkid struggles a lot with behavior and has always had issues (ADHD and ODD) I genuinely don't know how to help SK in this situation. ",

        "Upvotes": 13,
        "Text": "So I've recently been discarded by my covert narcissist girlfriend of 9 years, until this point I didn't really know much about narcissism, but after doing my research and being told by friends and family about what she was actually doing to me, it is terrifying to finally know who she really is. I've been living with, providing for, and been madly in love with a demon disguised as a human being for almost a decade. I honestly didn't know that someone could inflict so much pain, suffering, and damage to another person the way the covert does, for their own benefit.\n\nThe way the relationship started was, to be honest, insane looking back on it. She was amazing in my eyes, she was sex bombing me into oblivion, she liked all the same things that I did, we would party all the time and go clubbing together, she told me all of her childhood trauma and made out like she had never told anyone about it before and she felt so comfortable with me that she felt like she could share her most vulnerable secrets. This made me feel very special and that I had given this person a safe and comfortable environment with me, and to be honest, it made me feel like she was madly in love with me. She is a very good looking girl so for me this was a dream coming true, I'd met this amazing, sweet, beautiful girl who couldn't get enough of me and wanted to spend all of her free time with me. I fell head over heels with her and after a few months of us \"taking our time\" with it, we decided to become exclusive and we eventually moved back to my home country together...then everything started to change.\n\nOver the following years, she started to deploy the classic narcissist techniques of playing the victim every time I tried to express how I felt about something she did that I didn't like, she started disrespecting my boundaries, she always kept me on the edge of feeling like I wasn't doing enough to please her, she would be very critical of how I did things like house work or how I would play games too much, anything really started becoming a way of her directing my attention towards her and nothing else. She would never work more than 3 or 4 days a week (maybe 25 hours a week maximum) where as I was working full time as a Chef (50+ hour weeks) for the whole time we were together. This all happened so slowly over time and in very subtle ways that I didn't notice what was happening to me or what she was doing to manipulate my emotions and my mind. She never wanted to go to social gatherings with my work mates, so I stopped going out with friends, she never wanted to hang out with my family, so I stopped going to see my family, I eventually became so isolated from everyone that I never did anything anymore, my whole focus had to be on her and making sure that she was OK all the time.\n\nI would come home from work after having a bad day and if I tried to talk to her about it she would just zone out and never pay attention to me or give me any kind of support or back up. Eventually I started not saying anything about the problems I was having and just internalizing it because she would always get upset and make out like I did something to hurt her, all I was doing was talking about my day but I would have to apologise to her for bringing it up and make sure she was OK instead. This really messed my head up and started making me second guess if I had really had a bad day or if I was over reacting. Eventually my mental health spiralled out of control and I fell into a really deep depression. All of which she watched happen and never did anything to help me or to point out how bad I had gotten, she just made out like I was weak and that I was making her unhappy because of how I was behaving. The gaslighting from this chick. . . .man, it is the worst thing I've ever had to deal with, the second guessing myself and thinking that I had forgotten about how things went down in the past, or how I would notice something she did and she would tell me it didn't happen. It's fucking insane!\n\nThe last year though, wow she really showed her real self to me over the last 12 months before we broke up. I started studying because I had become so exhausted and burnt out from having to maintain the relationship on my own and working so many hours so that she didn't have to work, I decided that I needed to change my career to make it easier for us to be able to spend time together and to earn more money. Over that year, she started the long discard, she would try to get me to go back to working in kitchens by complaining about how she didn't want to work anymore because it's making her unhappy, she would devalue me and make out like anything I was achieving was nothing to be impressed about, she started going out with her work mates after work and coming home at 2 or 3 in the morning without asking me to go out with them. The worst thing she did though, was how she would punish me by telling me about how much attention she was getting from other men, and how they would buy her drinks when they went out, she would also buy nice clothes and tell me about how she was going to use them to get guys to buy her drinks when she went out. This is just a few examples of how she tried to emasculate me and make me feel like I was unattractive and not worthy of her. I really did feel helpless in the situation because I couldn't do anything about it. She even started withholding intimacy and sex from me, for months, it was maybe once a week or once a fortnight just so I had enough to keep me going but all the while making me feel like I was unable to please her and giving me performance anxiety due to her lack of enthusiasm and how cold she was being with me.\n\nThis whole process nearly destroyed me. I've never felt so useless and unlovable before in my life, I'm not an insecure person and I always had a high level of self worth, but she just sapped that all out of me just to make herself feel better about herself whilst also projecting her insecurities onto me and making me feel how she feels about herself. She started hanging out with a 19 year old girl she worked with (She is 30 years old by the way), and she started copying her personality, how she dressed, how she talked, and the things she would say were identical to this young girl, I think she saw this girl as her new supply and latched onto her, giving her all the attention and time that she could whilst simultaneously making me feel inferior and disgusting to be around.\n\nIt's been 6 weeks since we broke up now, I had no real closure or any solid reasoning behind her wanting to leave, she just blamed me for everything that went wrong and even though I had tried my hardest to try and fix things, she said that she just didn't care anymore and hadn't even thought about trying to fix the relationship she just wanted to be \"alone\". So after doing my research and getting her the hell out of my house and my life, I broke contact completely, and now I'm working on rebuilding my whole sense of self and more importantly, my mind! I felt like my mind had been split into two pieces, I couldn't remember how to interact with normal people anymore, I couldn't make sense of anything that happened and it really was driving me insane. Now I know though, I know what she was doing to me and I know that however she made me feel, It wasn't real, none of it was real, She wasn't real either, none of it was.\n\nThe hardest part about this for me has been rebuilding my self back into the person I was before all this happened. I feel like I've been living in a stunted realty for the past 9 years where I didn't grow up or mature correctly, now I'm out of it, I'm 32 years old and all of a sudden my level of maturity has caught up with my age and I don't really know how to deal with that just yet, it's like a couple of months ago I had the maturity of a 25 year old and now I have the maturity of a 32 year old within a couple of weeks. I've managed to reconnect with all of my family and my friends that I didn't see for years, and I honestly feel like I'm being myself again, but it's going to take time to get it fully back in order. They have such a crazy way of fucking your head up without you realizing it.   \n  \nTo be honest, I hate her so much for what she did to me but I've had to just let it go. She walked away from me like nothing happened and I didn't matter to her at all, she went out and partied with her mates the same night she broke up with me, like it was out of spite or to say fuck you to me when I did nothing wrong. Meanwhile I was left to have to figure it all out on my own and deal with the pain and suffering she caused me without any reason or knowledge of why she did what she did.  \n  \nAnyway I hope my story resonates with some of you and maybe you could give me some advice on how to move past this and get myself back on track again.",

        "Text": "The attacks on identity, pathologization, scapegoating and gaslighting got so bad I started acting out. In forced mental health treatment the therapist told me I would be labeled with either borderline or narcissistic personality disorder myself if I left her therapy and tried my luck somewhere else. I was angry for all the abuse and in bad physical shape. It hurt me when I ended up insome sort of attack therapy that invalidated me and criticized me some more. I am not sure how to understand it all...they seemed to accuse me of believing the world owes me something. I was unhappy about how my parents were attacking my boundaries, how my needs did not matter, how unconfortable I was getting gifts on occassions which didn't have anything in common with who I actually was as a person,  I was angry at some people from my past who themselves showed a tendency to treat me as if I was to be their servant and they showed displeasure when other people seemed  interested in me. I was dealing with complex trauma and the past went crashing down on my head after I experienced significant life altering shock. This therapy was too much for me. Believing I deserved better and being angry for abuse and neglect and betrayal means I am the narcissist? I didn't have any capacity for more criticism left for sure. Yes, I understand I am responsible for my own life but I am tired by all the obstacles and I was traumatized by how cannibalistic towards me the people I loved actually were. So it's me who actually just wasn't good enough and I was to be punished for not handling it all better. ",

I can’t trust my own judgment. It’s not even about him anymore, it’s about accepting and moving on from being sexually and emotionally attached to someone who was abusive. I can’t cope with it.

        "Text": "I've been so blind, let her twist narratives and scenarios to make others seem abusive or the issue. Never criticising or questioning her, losing friends because I knew them through her and then she cut them out but they had treated her poorly so I didn't want to be there friend anymore, it was never that she told me to not be friends, I withdrew myself, but only after she had badmouthed them to me repeatedly.\n\nTwice we've had negative housemate experiences where she basically drove them out, and to be fair there were issues with their behaviour but in hindsight she manipulated me to make it all seem so much worse and bigger than it was and the one time I suggested her behaviour was the issue she emotionally manipulated me into feeling bad and saying sorry. I was just out of a toxic living situation, and she was able to mould me and push my into her cookie cutter so I went along with everything she wanted, thinking it was what I wanted.\n\nI've been struggling most of the time I've known her, with my mental health ir physical health issues or burnout. And she was once so loving. We felt like housemates or friends didn't fit our relationship and used to call each other life companions. But slowly over the last year and a half - two years that love has been withdrawn bit by bit and more and more problems and issues cropped up (never her fault of course or never fully her fault). Bit by bit she's broken me down and made me feel like I can't do anything right, like I'm the problem.. \n\nAnd I've been doing better with mental health and other things lately and my self confidence has grown so I don't believe her criticism anymore. She's been struggling with both physical and mental health. So suddenly she has more and more reasons to criticise me and minimise any concerns I raise. And put me in a position where I have to help her, because the majority of her support network has just disappeared (she's pushed them away or cut them out) but then when I finally set a boundary and can't help and call her out for toxic behaviour she says the issue has been my lack of boundaries up until now, even though she's made me feel like I can't say no to her with how unwell she's been. And I removed myself from an interaction this week because I didn't want to be criticised again and she blew up and when I tried raise my emotional concerns she's says I'm bypassing hers and we need to deal with her emotional needs and I need to acknowledge her hurt before focusing on mine because I always make it all about myself (which is the funniest thing I've ever heard, all I've ever done is minimise myself for her). \n\nAnd, while I'm happy to move out, she fully manipulated me into it, saying we weren't working but making me the issue. She's lonely because I'm too much of an introvert. I was moving out because I couldn't give her what she needed. 🙄 I needed too much solitude so I should live alone so housemates weren't disappointed by me. What the actual fuck? I can't even afford to live alone but she'd brainwashed me so much I believed it was what I wanted. I can't believe how under her spell I was. It's so fucked.",

        "Text": "I put up with a lot of hurt and think he’s a narcissist? But I’m not sure all advice welcome *TW* mentions suicide and domestic violence \n\nCan someone help me understand? I’m sorry this is so long. \n\nHi all. My (27F) most recent relationship was long distance with a guy (24M) several states away. We met online through a dating app and I flew to him after one month of us being together. We had a wonderful time, everything was fine, he seemed so real and genuine. We did get pulled over when we were together and there was an issue with his license. I never felt like I got a real story from him about it. He always seemed just explain it so confidently but it just didn’t add up. He also had been telling me that he had classes on Saturdays but he never told me what they were for and I had assumed something academic. He acted like he had already told me, but “again” explained he saw a man hitting a woman and went to defend her and punched the guy. After that he was ordered to go to anger management classes. He had never told me that, but I believed him. \n\nAfter I got home, I was trying to communicate with him and ended up getting weird messages and got blocked. I sobbed and sobbed, trying to understand. The next day, he messaged like nothing happened and I immediately felt relief that he was contacting me again. When I asked what happened, he said he had to go pickup his drunk roommates (that he frequently complained about) and they were messing with his phone and must’ve done it. \n\nRelationship goes on. We continue our nightly calls and texts, still getting to know each other and enjoy each other. He keeps complaining about his roommates because apparently they hate him and won’t pay their share of rent. \n\nEven though he was paying, he still ends up getting kicked out by them? So he starts couch surfing. He told me he doesn’t have a lot of friends. He has Asperger’s and is pretty introverted. It came off as endearing to me at the time. He somehow lost his job that he had when we first met (chef in a hospital) and was trying to find something new. \n\nHis attitude towards me starts to kinda change. I’ll go ahead and say I am very clingy and need a lot of reassurance. I basically was begging him to reassure me things were ok and we were ok because of the way he’d come off towards me. We talked about breaking up a lot. It was rough. \n\nHe came to visit me a couple months after my trip to him, but I had to pay for his flight. I had lent him money multiple times, some of it explicitly with “this is a loan and i need to be paid back” with empty promises I would get paid. He wouldn’t explicitly ask me for money but he’d bring up various different things going wrong and would act like he could tough it out, but it seems like he knew I’d offer to help him so he’d complain and throw a pity party. I also don’t think he ever thanked me for helping, but he claims he did. \n\nHe goes back home and the communication problems are still frequent. He finally seems to get kinda settled with a job and housing or whatever so I plan i fly up there again, but I had to tell him prior to that I still loved him but needed to fall in love with him again that he had had so many issues recently that occupied so much of his time and mental space I felt really forgotten. He seemed shocked at this. He would always talk about how he screwed things up and oh woah is him but he’d never really fix the problems. He might try harder for a few days and then poof back to his same ole. \n\nI end up going up there and stayed a few nights. Things started off great. He then decides it is time to tell me the truth about his classes on Saturdays. He told me that he and previous girlfriend were living together and things had gotten heated and he wanted to break up and leave. She stood in between him and the door and he tried to push past her to leave and she clocked him. He continues to try to leave but apparently she keeps hitting him. He somehow calls the cops and they arrive to figure it out. He doesn’t wanna press charges just wants to leave. But she does want to press charges. So he was going to classes on Saturdays for domestic charge and decided he wouldn’t actually tell me till we’d been together 6 months. \n\nI took a while to process. I was an hour and a half away from the airport with no car and didn’t feel like I was in immediate danger or anything so I just said ok and moved on. We ended up having adult intimate moments, for me, my first time ever (I have been on BC for years for PCOS and was taking it then just as an FYI) and he teared up after wards because he “had never felt so loved”. \n\nWe later go bowling and everything is fine and happy. He has made it known he wants a family because he felt like he wanted to be a better parent than his parents were to him (mommy and daddy issues). I’ve never felt strongly about kids but if they happen, they happen. While bowling, I brought up that if we decide to do fun adult intimate things again, I’d like to get some condoms because I wanna be extra safe. (I know I shouldn’t have said this next part, but for me as a southern religious Christian woman, it is a real concern) but I told him “I wanna be extra careful because how do I know he wouldn’t get me pregnant and leave me to be a single mom?” \n\nAnd he shut down. Quit talking to me while we were out bowling. Drove erratically back to the air bnb when we left. I was crying trying to figure out why he was ignoring me. He did ask if I wanted food but at that point I’d lost my appetite. He finally said it was “because I know he wants a family and I should’ve known he would never do that” he dropped me off and said he was gonna go get a drink. Was texting me things instead of talking to me to my face. I was sobbing at the room. He heard me have a panic attack and did nothing. He left and got drunk. Came back and packed his stuff up. Locked himself for a while in the bathroom and wouldn’t respond. I started to panic because I was afraid maybe he had committed suicide in there (I knew he had depression and I have horrible anxiety and started assuming the worst) he finally came out. Still drunk. Said he’d go stay somewhere else and come back for me in the morning to take me to the airport. Then it changed into he would get an Uber for me to take me back. He went back out drunk driving. I kept begging him to come back and talk to me so I could apologize. Eventually he did come back and said we could talk. He was cold and still clearly drunk. But said the only way he thought we could get through this was to just forget about it and move on. \n\nThings were awkward the next day but we ultimately ended on an ok note when I went home. It wasn’t until I met with my therapist that I really realized how traumatic that trip was for me. She said of course he wanted forget about it and move on because he knew he way over reacted and didn’t want me to cling to that. We did somewhat talk about it later but I don’t know if he ever really felt wrong for how he acted. We try to keep going and he still thinks I’m his soul mate and the love of his life. \n\nHe comes back down a few months later and stays for like a week. It was some good and some bad moments. He’d tell me he loves me and how amazing I am but that night he wouldn’t wanna even touch me when we were laying down. It felt like he’d purposefully lean away from me. Arguments here and there. Just problematic. He goes back home. \n\nHe was supposed to have a court date to get an update on the progress from his classes and he quit responding to me. It had been like 24 hours so I decide to look through his friends on Instagram trying to find a particular friend of his to contact to see if my guy was ok. As I was looking, I ended up finding only fans girls he was following on Instagram and the half naked pictures he had liked. It broke me. I had been very upfront with him that I am against porn in a relationship. But I didn’t know I had to specify half naked women on social media. \n\nWhen I finally heard from him, he said he had spent the night in jail because he didn’t have confirmation of his classes or some dumb shit and they couldn’t get it till the next day. I told him I wanted to break up because I was so tired of everything and then seeing that he’s staring at and liking these pictures was it for me. “You want to break up over some pictures I liked on Instagram??? I didn’t even do it, *friend* did it because he was using my phone because his girlfriend doesn’t like him looking at that kinda stuff” I was done. He hung up. Called back quickly and said “if I can get *friend* to confirm it was him, can we stay together?” And I was unsure. I was so tired of being hurt but felt like I needed a valid reason to break up. He ends up sending a screenshot where the guy took ownership (I assumed my ex told the guy to do it and screenshot the relevant parts) so I said I didn’t want to be together. \n\nBut it broke my heart and i kept leaning on him for support because I couldn’t quit crying and we never officially said we were back together but basically ended up back together. I still went through and broke up with him again around November. We kinda stayed in contact but at some point I told him i didn’t want to talk anymore I was done. Unfriended him on social media. He kept sending texts. \n\nHe made a fake Snapchat to reach out to me with “the goal of making me fall for him again without me realizing it was him” but clearly I figured it out. I blocked him on social media. He had sent a few more texts up until like new years. Then nothing. In February he made a fake tiktok to reach out again. We chatted some and he clearly still had feelings and wanted to be together but i kept my distance. He still claimed he was going to move down ti be with me when he had stuff figured out and settled and saved money to. \n\nHe told me he had one date while we broke up but he kept comparing her to me. He said he even checked himself into a facility to get some mental health help because he had gotten so low mentally. But he never bothered to ask if I had seen anyone or anything. I had in fact. No new relationship or anything but I’d at least been on a date and kinda had a fling. He said he had been to therapy (I tried to get him to go when we were together and he said he did for a bit but claimed his therapist berated him for how he treated me and made him feel bad about stuff so he quit going). \n\nSo months later, one day, he said his therapist gave him the talk of writing a letter to someone he loved. So he wrote it to me and asked if he could call me and read it to me. It was beautiful. I later read it to my bestie and she said it sounded familiar. I ended up googling it and he basically ripped off a poem. I asked him about it and he said he missed me and that’s why he made it for me and he loves me so much or whatever. I called him out on it and sent him a picture of the poem. He just acted confused and said “wow this doesn’t seem authentic now I’m sorry I’ll write you a new one” I said it wasn’t a coincidence it too similar. He said maybe he had heard it before and it inspired him. I said it was almost line for  line the exact same poem. He said he has “eidetic memory” aka photographic memory and maybe he had written her poem without realizing it. I just quit responding. He messaged back “are you upset?” “Hello?” And I finally responded the next day and told him off. To leave me alone and let me heal. Don’t contact me again. Blah. Before I could block him he just said “Tf?” And that’s the last I’ve heard. He’s blocked. No fake accounts yet. \n\nI just… I need to know what others think about this whole situation. I feel like an idiot for not trusting my gut early on that he was fishy. But I never had the confidence to call him out on his crap. He was so charming to me and confident and I just fell into his trap I guess. My therapist never met him, but she thought he was Narcissistic or Borderline Personality Disorder based off of what I told her. \n\nIf anyone has any insight or any encouraging words, please let me know. I don’t really know what I’m looking for. Maybe sympathy and words of encouragement that I can find a real genuine man that won’t leave me feeling like that again. Maybe some confirmation that the hurt I’ve felt is real. Idk. Thank you all. I am sorry this is so long but I felt like I needed to just get this ALL off of my chest. ",

        "Text": "Without going into a long rant, my in-laws are narcissists.  My wife (also a covert narcissist) would not stand up with me against them.  Over time, I began to drink in response to the gaslighting, deflection, and blame-shifting (basically the cognitive dissonance they created).  Now, it was my decision to drink.  The in-laws used it as a way to get my wife and kids to alienate me out of their lives.\n\nTo make a long story short, I got help.  As I tried to reconcile, my in-laws tried every way they could to prevent it.  This is based on what my wife and kids told the family counselor.  Eventually, we reconciled and moved away from the in-laws.  They refused to talk to me for three years.  By the end of the second year, I finally got to a point where I felt nothing for them.  They are just people we used to know.  I am over four and a half years sober.\n\nAt year three, almost to the day, I got the hoover.  I refused it.  They continued to try and then tried to get other relatives to intervene (as flying monkeys).  I refused.  My kids want nothing to do with them.  My wife reluctantly has little to do with them.  Life is good.  We are CEOs (we see them on Christmas, Easter, and Other Special Occasions).  This is compounded by the fact that my son is being heavily recruited as a D1 Running Back.  We go on all sorts of recruiting visits.  This is something that my brother-in-law would have liked to be involved in.  Her fancies himself as an amateur \"coach.\"  He is enamored by the lifestyle that he is now shut out of.  He was always trying to worm his way into my son's sports to brag that he was the reason my son was good.  When I was out of the picture (that's what they called it), my brother-in-law would take my son to tournaments and tell the other parents that he was the dad.  Sickening.  My son is good because of his hard work.  I only drive the car to get him where he needs to go.  The talent is his.  But they wanted to co-opt that in order to increase their status.  They are ruled by ego.  But, we are all in no contact, and they get none of it.\n\nI recently found out that my brother-in-law's cancer has returned and is aggressive.  My sister-in-law will lose her job at the end of the year.  The $28,000 medicine they got for the brother-in-law's cancer was accidentally thrown in the trash.  Their life is falling apart.\n\nI don't care.  I cannot bring myself to care.  I hold no hatred for them.  I don't care.  They are relatives, but they are no longer family.  My family consists of those people who support my family unconditionally.  My in-laws were the only ones that did not want to see me get sober.  They tried in every way to prevent our reconciliation.  \n\nA friend of mine in AA told me, \"You have forgiven them.  This is why you are no longer angry.  Just because you have forgiven them does not mean you must be concerned with their problems.  They are not your problems.  They belong to them.  You are not obligated to feel bad or to have a relationship with them.  You are free to choose to leave them alone.\"\n\nWhat do all of you think? It bothers me that I don't care, but I am also relieved that they are no longer in my life, undermining my marriage and my relationship with my kids.",

        "Text": "I feel like i know the answer but i don't want to jump too soon; these could just be learned narc behaviors and a serious thirst for drama.\n\nBackground: My BiL and i met in 2013-2014, then in 2016 he came and stayed with us for a month and just.. *whoa*. WHOA. He LOVES drama. He loves creating it, watching it and then pretending to be the hero and patch things up. Love bombing, jabs, insulting, endangering our animals, demeaning me, dismissing any struggles i had, refusing to be held accountable, attempting to sabotage my now-husband and i, attacking our friends for literally anything you can think of, made threats of turning his whole family against me and picking fights repeatedly. I was raised by two narcs and both of their enablers, so this is all very familiar. When it all happened, my mental health tanked hard. I seriously thought about taking and even planned to take my own life.\n\nBefore the 2016 visit, he, my husband and i all got a phone plan and our phones together. We all paid our own parts (except BiL). After the contract was over, my husband and i got on our own plan (just after his visit in 2016). In 2021, he came to our town to visit husband's family and told them all about how he paid for our phones and my tablet. I was outraged.\n\nWe all ended up \"reconciling\" and speaking again; he was ok for a bit and i was trying to establish trust and friendship so we asked him to do the vows when husband and i got married. He accepted and we went on thinking everything was great and things were going to get better. Buuut.. things started getting weird.\n\nHe started making grandiose promises: there are many that go unfulfilled but the latest and most extravagant is that he bought a house and keeps PUSHING US to move 1300 miles away from where we are now to his house, no charge, rent free. I have repeatedly said that i do not want to live in the state he lives in and i am NOT comfortable AT ALL with the idea of living rent free. He tried to tell us to sell our car, quit our jobs and go live with him and \"figure things out.\" He even told me divorce my husband and marry him for the veteran benefits/healthcare (he's 100% gay so i'm not worried that he's trying to get with me or anything). All of this and more would make us COMPLETELY dependent on him. What's worse, when we humored this idea, he started telling us we'd need to get rid of our pets, PUSHING this hard, and when i called him on it he told me i was the one who brought it up (completely untrue and i have the texts to prove it).\n\nWe got involved with an online gaming group that also liked drama and, dear lord, BiL hopped RIGHT in and just soaked in it. When we finally had enough, he'd keep bringing us back to them, them back to us, when things were calm he would hop back in, rinse and repeat. The few people that were cool that we're still in touch with were public enemy #1 to him (when things were calm and there was no drama to partake in) and he would continuously try to turn us against them. Me being me kept thinking \"oh he's just trying to patch things up with the others and protect us from jerks!\" I know, i know, ugh.\n\nWorst of all, he works for a dental group and said he wanted to help us with our teeth.. except he dropped the ball halfway through and i have been freaking out for 2 years about how this will all play out. He said this was a wedding gift to us and refused to accept any sort of payment. However, last night he was on the phone with us and was acting like we were just asking for free crap. I snapped at him about it bc i am over this WHOLE thing. I literally just want it to end. We have had to fight with him to finish the dental stuff and he keeps going back and forth about whether or not he feels like helping us anymore and it's LITERALLY in the middle of everything. I have been losing it for too long, depressed and anxious, bc we're not sure if we can pick a ball of this magnitude up when he drops it bc dental is EXPENSIVE.\n\nThere's a lot more about this that i'm not saying here, but the main point is from his text to me this morning. It was a huge pity party, him telling me that he \"understand\\[s\\] that there have been certain things in \\[my\\] past that have impacted \\[me\\] in a bad way but \\[he\\] cannot be taxed on that. \\[He's\\] not interested in being taxed on things \\[he\\] didn't do to \\[me\\].\"\n\nNothing that i have said to him or done to him has been a result of ANYTHING except his actions and words. I felt like he positioned himself as a victim and i was being talked down to, infantilized, dismissed and gaslit. He put everything he did TO me ON me. To top that off, how dare he bring up.. my past? My husband has told me he shared some things (things he knew i wouldn't mind being shared) but nothing in depth and.. BiL USED that. He used that and immediately started calling me \"mean and nasty\"-exactly what Nmom said when i tried to hold HER accountable-and then effectively said end of discussion (\"I think it's best to just end the conversation. Because i'm not feeling good about any of this.\")..\n\ni feel like.. i don't want to know the truth or what anyone thinks bc i don't WANT to not get along with my in-laws but.. i just can't do this anymore. I got away from narcs in my family and every time i'm in contact with him i feel horrible, i feel like i'm back there.. but i still want to know what others think.. so please help.\n\nEdit: Wording order was off.",

Now, the story. We left our jobs (worked in sane place) in April. We had some money and figured we’d find a job. Well we didn’t. Husband got upset with me for not being career driven like he is. I spent the first 10 ish years being a stay at home mom. He is a chef so he worked long hours and I chose to be an active mom. I didn’t have that as a kid, bla bla. Anyways he blamed me for not being more motivated. Not being able to take care of him. We had a trip to London in July and it was amazing. We were doing great minus the fights beforehand. Then we got back and it got insane. He was stressed. I tried to stay calm because I’m just like that and he would belittle me and rage at me. So one day I got so fed up after he threw a divorce at me that I told him I was going to see my mom for a while in Florida. Now I’m here. He won’t let me come home. He gave me “rules” to be able to contact him. He has our kids. He is cold and saying he is better off without me and he’s earned his freedom. And I’m stuck here and mentally broken. I know he’s a narc. I know I need to move on. But it’s 20 years. He has our kids and our dog. I’m alone and I miss him so much. And yet he won’t even say one word to me. It kills me inside. \nHow do you get over this hurt feelings. How do you move on from someone who’s yes a not perfectly great husband but he’s my best friend and I love him dearly. How do I get in the mindset that I deserve better? I’m a wreck and I’m just sad all the time. ",

        "Text": "What is the darkest manipulation tactic?Covert manipulation\nIt is done under the guise of them “caring” for you. These spiders lure you into their web of abuse by showering you with attention, love, kindness and being thoughtful and supportive. Everything you’ve always wanted.\nThen, once they have you in their web, they start to take those things away, little by little and they say it’s your fault they’re going away. You try and improve and please them. You’re now caught in their web with a spider and its slowly wrapping more of the web around you.\nThen, when you’re completely entangled in their web they start to suck your life energy out of you, like a spider. By denying your reality (gaslighting) it creates cognitive dissonance in your mind and you “freeze” as you’re conflicted over what is real and what isn’t. This is them inserting psychological and physical poison (through intermittent reinforcement) into you. You’re now stuck in the web and you feel trapped and you can’t get out. Then, they take away more and more completely depleating your life energy. These people feed off of you trying to make the relationship better and you don’t even know they’re doing this the whole time, you think the spider is your friend…\nThen, when there’s no more energy to suck out of you they leave you to die alone stuck in their web. It takes you YEARS to get out of it and nobody can help you get out. You have to find your own way of untangling that web, and it’s not just physical but psychologically and emotionally stuck in that web too.\nAfter the person (spider) leaves you to die on the web (or during your relationship with them) they go and make another web and the same cycle repeats itself with the next victim.\nCovert abuse is by far the worst because it’s done under the guise of love when the reality is quite the opposite, it’s the definition of EVIL and DEATH",

        "Text": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nThis is not an easy topic for me (19F) to talk about because it really bothers me. So I would really appreciate your help in letting me know if I am or not crazy 😔 \n\nFor most of my teenage years, I had a best friend (We'll call her L.) She and I got along like peas in a pod, we loved each other so much, saw each other like sisters. Cried together, laughed together, shared everything and was always there for one another. \n\nBoth of us used to be bullied & never really had any friends. So we stuck to each other like glue and I never imagined the way our beautiful sisterhood friendship would eventually end. I loved and cared for her very much. I would drop everything when I found out she was depressed to help her out. I was always ready to help her and support her in any way she needed, and she did the same for me. \n\nOur friendship lasted 4 years. We went through the awkward teenage years and helped each other through it (I don't think I could have gone through the weird hormonal, puberty, emotional stage without her) \n\nBut after 4 years, things changed. I moved state for a year and a half for certain family reasons, but we planned to go back. When she found out, she was a bawling depressed mess. She cried every time we met up, out goodbye she was slobbering all over me hugging me and begging me not to go. It was so painful. But we promised to keep in contact. And we did. Every day. \n\nBut after a few months, she suddenly stopped talking to me. And this weird pattern started happening. She wouldn't talk to me for 3 or 4 months, and suddenly message me apologising for her absence and suddenly wanted to see me and talk and FaceTime and she missed me so much. So we organised face time days. And every time I grabbed my laptop to talk with her on the time that SHE asked for, she wouldn't turn up. And I wouldn't hear from her for another 3 - 4 months. \n\nShe even invited me to her birthday party so I booked a plane ticket to go see her and at the last minute told me she was going to a different state instead for her birthday. I was already on the plane when she told me. And after that it was another 3 - 4 months of zero communication. She apologised once and told me she was extremely depressed because her grandpa died and her mother was also dying of Kidney failure. So I understood. \n\nBut two months before I moved back home, she suddenly added me on social media. Before that time I didn't have anything really. \n\nOn her Instagram I started noticing that she would post pictures of her and this girl almost every single day. Them doing everything together.  She looked so happy, every day there were so many photos of her doing so many different things and I was so confused. \n\nAfter I moved back to the state, I saw her at church for the first time in a long while. I waved and smiled at her. She ignored me. She stared into my eyes without any expression and later went home, walking right past me. \n\nThis happened for another ENTIRE year and a half. Every week I would see her at church. It was painful. I couldn't understand what was going on. Some days she would come up to me, beaming, talking so confidently, \"Oh hi! Omg I'm so happy to see you!!!\" But then walk off. I thought I was going crazy. \n\nI started to notice her behaviour being really weird. L had always been extremely shy and anxious. But suddenly at church, she was extremely confident and talkative. And fake. You can just tell with some people. L was fake. All her smiles and compliments were all FAKE. I could see right through her since I knew her so well. And everyone at church LOVED her. Everytime she walked in she would be swarmed with everyone shouting her name almost like a celebrity. And they all started to ignore ME. \nEven when I spoke to some people at church, they would walkways being up how wonderful and sweet L was. And it started to make me feel sick. \nIn front of others, L would treat me so nicely. The minute no on was around, she treated me worse than a stranger. \n\nI started noticing patterns. Some days at church, she would come up to me and say, \"I've missed you, we really have to talk again. Let's talk after the service is over?\" \nAnd I would say yes. But every time the service was over, she would go home IMMEDIATELY. On the days that she ignored me, she would stay for hours and not go home. I thought it was a coincidence at first, but after it happening for over a year I realised that she was doing it on purpose. \n\nAfter a year and a half, my life changed drastically. I stopped bothering about L. I had more important things to worry about. I went through a depression. It was very bad. I ended up hooking up with a guy friend of mine that I was actually in love with but he didn't seem to feel the same way back. And with all the heartbreak and work related issues, I ran away from home. There was actually a lot of reasons why I ran away from home, but no one knew what had happened. I decided to keep everything a secret because I didn't trust anybody anymore. \n\nI moved in with my guy best friend, and my heart started healing again. I got healthier and happier. We started dating. I couldn't believe that I got my first boyfriend. We loved each other so much and I was very happy. \n\nI stopped going to church after I ran away because I needed a break from life. I disappeared for four months, and during that time, no one really knew what was going on with me. I became a bit of a rumour and gossip topic for everyone at church to talk about. \n\nAfter all that time, I suddenly got a message on my phone from L. She sent me a long message, saying she was worried about me and she felt really horrible about the way she had treated me and wanted to be friends again, wanted to meet up somewhere and try again. She admitted that it was horrible timing, because it sounded like she was just trying to see me again because I ran away, but justified that that wasn't the reason. \n\nI was shocked by the message. After her ignoring me for three years, I didn't know how to respond. But I said yes to meeting up. And we did. \n\nOver the next three months, we met up four times. I decided that if she wanted to restart a friendship, that she was going to be the one to put in all the work. Because I had tried so hard for three years. Now it was her turn. I never asked her out. If she wanted to hang out, she would have to ask me herself. And that's how it went. \n\nThe first meet up was extremely quiet and awkward. The second one was really good. It was the day after my birthday and she gave me a little birthday gift. An oversized cardigan and a bottle of lotion. The third one, it felt very strange, like she was trying to dig into my personal life and get all my details. I obviously didn't trust her and wouldn't tell her anything. The fourth time, she gossiped about all her ex best friends and how they are all toxic. For three hours she ranted about all these people I didn't even know, about how evil they all were. It was very uncomfortable for me.\n\nAfter the fourth Meetup, I decided that she wansnt the person for me. I was still nice to her, but when she asked me out I said I was busy. And I WAS. I was working all the time. \n\nWe still spoke sometimes at church, but it always felt so fake and I felt disgusted. \n\nEventually my boyfriend and I got engaged and we announced it to the church. Everyone was shocked... \nEveryone clapped and said congratulations, but L was frozen the whole time. A few hours later she came to me to congratulate me, but it was extremely fake and strange. \n\nAfter that, I noticed her staring and me and my fiance during the hour long sermons. Just STARING. Looking angry like she wanted to snap my head off. \n\nShe suddenly tried to find reasons to hate my fiance. She had a deep conversation with him one day. My fiance is a very open and honest person. L asked him for advice on something, and he gave it to her just as he asked, even after warning her 4 times that he could be very honest about these things. She told him that she has thick skin, and kept pushing him over and over till he gave her the advice she asked for. \n\nThat night, my father came to me and told me that L's father had told him that my fiance had been extremely rude to L and hurt her feelings. She had been crying all afternoon and her father told her to stay away from my fiance. I was PISSED. L started spreading things to people that my fiance was a mean person. She thought I didn't know but I caught her many times. \n\nAfter we got married, we moved state to start a new life together. L said a sweet goodbye to me. But it made me sick to my stomach. \n\nI didn't hear from her for months after that and I decided to forget about her. And I did! But then something even worse happened that made me go from disliking her to hatred. \n\nFrom this alone, would you say she is a narcissist? What would you say is wrong with her? \n\nI'll add part 2 soon so you can get a better image of her there. \nThank you for reading by the way, I really appreciate it. It's been really hurting me lately and some advice would go a long way x",

Even now i have a boyfriend and we all hung out and all they were doing was flirting with him and moaning doing sexual things and asked for his insta of all things.\n\nAnd when i said no they got so mad when i called them out even though they have a partner themselves. I hate going out with them sometimes because of the slapping and just stuff they would say to me.

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "Was I stupid? Or delusional?\n\nSo, I kept in contact with the guy that I worked with after he quit his job. One night he called me and I’m thinking we are going to have a normal conversation. He’s drunk, but I can’t tell, because he seems to be holding it together. He brings up something I said weeks before I left. It had never bothered him before, but for some reason he decided to say something at the most in opportune time. Honestly, he had a bad habit of not saying things at the moment and then bringing them up later unexpectedly, and then we’d argue. I’d feel overstimulated and disengage from the conversation. I knew he was a narc, because he would let shit fester when I think that we are done with the conversation. \n\nSo here we are, on the phone talking about the conversation, and my response that just now bothered him. By the way, the conversation was about his type of woman; short, light skinned with curly hair. I think he said, skinny, but I’m not sure. So, I responded “omg the sounds like you are describing me!” I laughed about it, and it seemed to not bother him. I wasn’t paying attention to his reaction because I was looking away thoughtfully as I said it. This was the conversation he brought up weeks later. He asked me why I said something like that.\n\n“I found some similarities that you described that described me, is all,” is what I said. May have been different. Some information is skewed. \n\n“You’re not even light-skinned! And your hair is nappy, NOT curly!” he replied. \n\n“Isn’t nappy another version of curly?” I asked. “And I am sort of light skinned.” \n\n“You’re not light skinned! I am even lighter than you!” he said. He was getting angry, and I didn’t understand why. I felt he was making it more of a big deal than necessary. \n\nHe started saying I was delusional, that I need mental help. I told him if he can’t actually have a conversation with me and not be a child, we could discuss shit like adults. I hung up, blocked his number, and I thought that would be it. \n\nNope. He texted me, continuously calling me names, saying that he’s concerned for my health, and then mentioning that I have spots on my skin from picking. This message was from another number. I blocked that number too. Oh, but before I blocked him, he kept mentioning other things I said on the past too that I won’t get into. \n\nI was having anxiety, breaking down crying all because I said one thing. All I wanted was for him to calm down so we could actually have a conversation and solve this. If I was wrong, we could settle it. \n\nI talked with my friends about it, and they agreed that he was very much insane and should not have reacted in that kind of manner. \n\n“It’s okay that he’s annoyed,” they said. “But he shouldn’t react like this over one wrong declaration. You aren’t light skinned. And we can see why you would think that way. He shouldn’t have reacted.”\n\nAfter my nerves calmed down, I explained that we would no longer be friends. I called him an abuser, because his behavior was abusive (I would know, I have been in an abusive friendship). I said that “people like him” should not treat people that way over some misunderstanding. \n\nHe replied, apologizing at first. But then he was offended when I said “people like him” and went off at me again, proving my point that he was an abuser. \n\nI blocked his number.\n\nHere are the comments that he sent before I blocked him. \n\n“You seriously don’t know how nasty you look?” (Regarding a comment I said about me being prettier than someone, because, well, I can’t have self confidence, but he can). \n\n“What are all your disabilities, seriously?” (You do f ask someone your disabilities like that). \n\n“You’re straight up denying your skin color” (because I said only one time that I was KINDA light skinned). \n\n\n\nThis is the short version of this story. But yeah I finally blocked him. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Upvotes": 8,
        "Text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been dealing with this nightmare for over a decade, and I feel like I need to share my story with others who might understand. My ex and his mother conspired to put bruises on my son when he was a baby in order to falsely accuse me of child abuse and take custody of him. Despite the blatant manipulation, the courts and CPS used those fabricated claims against me, and they managed to steal custody of my son for a time.\n\nTo make things worse, my ex was very physically abusive toward me. He even had a police record of domestic violence, but CPS and the courts ignored it throughout the custody battle. For 12.5 years, I’ve been fighting to protect my son and prove the truth.\n\nBefore I became pregnant at 20, my ex’s mother convinced me to have his baby, and I was young and naive enough to listen. Before that, she had tried to gain custody of a cousin of hers she had never even met, but the child’s grandfather fought her off in court. She constantly told me to come to her with any issues regarding her son, saying she could \"set him straight.\" She, too, was a victim of domestic violence from my ex's father (though I’ve never met him, so I only know her side).\n\nThirteen years ago, her niece warned me that my ex's mother would do anything to take my son from me, and when she finally did, that same niece sided with her. I was 23 at the time and had argued with my ex when he would harass me and my then-boyfriend. Because of that, they both saw me as the problem.\n\nFrom the very beginning, my ex’s goal was to gain custody of our son, and he abused him as a baby to create bruises that he and his mother would later use to frame me for child abuse. They manipulated the system, and their plan worked, as they took custody of my son for a time.\n\nIn 2015, my ex abused my son again while he was engaged to another woman. His ex-fiancé reached out to tell me what had happened, but she was terrified for herself and her own son, so she refused to go to the police. The bruises were so severe that my ex’s mother panicked and tried to cover it up because she was scared I’d regain custody. The ex-fiancé shared that she had always been told the bruises on my son as a baby were my fault, but after experiencing her own abuse and witnessing the 2015 incident, she realized my ex was the real abuser all along. She finally left him months later when she had the means to escape.\n\nDuring the 2015 investigation, my ex’s mother showed my son the bruises from when he was a baby and told him I was the one who hurt him. She even gave him a specific story about how I supposedly twisted his ears to leave bruises. Ever since then, she’s been manipulating my son to turn against me, and it’s worked a few times over the years.\n\nThree years ago, I was finally able to regain primary custody of my son, but the fight is far from over. I’m still battling to keep him safe from their manipulations and harm. It’s been an exhausting and heartbreaking journey that has taken a heavy toll on both me and my son.\n\nI feel so isolated at times, as the system seems stacked against us, and people often don’t understand how far narcissists will go to destroy lives. Has anyone else faced this kind of ordeal? How have you managed to cope and keep your children safe from toxic ex-partners and their family members?\n\nAny support, advice, or encouragement would mean the world to me right now. Thank you for listening. 🙏",

Was it some sort of threat?\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nP.S. I’ve left details out on purpose because they are the type of people to go looking online to see if I’ve posted anything.

        "Text": "Advice for self care\n\n(TW: Violence, sexual assault, mental abuse, suicidal thoughts, I hope that you are all okay today ❤️)\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI (31 y/o F) am in the process of a very difficult and painful divorce from my wife (32 y/o) of 7 years and I am having a lot of difficulty with keeping my head level and not spiralling into a pit of despair.\n\nThe last 7 years have been incredibly difficult, confusing and overwhelming… Throughout our relationship I have experienced very many different types and levels of abuse from her. She has been physically abusive (in so many different ways, but an example is semi-regularly punching me in the head while I slept and then brushing it off the next day because she would tell me that she didn’t remember so it wasn’t her fault), sexually abusive (forcing me into sex, calling me frigid, being rough…), mentally abusive (gaslighting me, lying to me, attempting to belittle me in private and public, trying to isolate me, attempting to coerce me into things that I expressed that I didn’t feel comfortable about, manipulating me, bullying me… So many more…).\n\nA week ago, after many attempts to call things off over the years with a heavy, heavy, devastated heart, she finally left our home to let me have some space and to “get better so that she can be good for me”.\n\nThe last week has been a complete roller coaster of elation, terror, despair, fear, depression and hope…. I feel like I have been in a trance but also have been feeling more present and in my own body than I have ever throughout the last 7 years.\n\nWe live in a house that we have been buying off her parents (next door to them 😰), in a country town that is ~2.5 hours away from all of my closest friends.\n\nI have been gently reaching out to a few of my trusted friends to explain the situation and I have gotten amazing overwhelming love and support… It has been so humbling… I feel like I start to hysterically cry every time I think about how lucky I am for this….\n\nEvery one of my friends have given me amazing insight and care throughout this, but everyone universally has expressed that they want me to get out of here ASAP (with their help in any way) and move back near them. Which I want to do…. But I feel completely paralysed and overwhelmed.\n\nI don’t have any family support or anything like that… I also have had quite ill health for the last few years, I have very severe endometriosis, Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome and ADHD… Although, my physical health has improved a bit over the last few days…. I am also currently studying a bachelor with the eventual goal of studying medicine and becoming a gynaecologist….\n\nI am so terrified about what is next…. Financially, mentally, physically, logistically… Sometimes I find myself feeling pragmatic and feel like I can gently explore things that I need to do to start leaving and moving on…. But most of the time I feel like I am drowning in a pit feeling like my chest is caving in….\n\nI feel like I objectively understand that things are likely to only improve…. I feel like I am already starting to feel and understand this. But I also feel like I still am so in love with her and find myself getting overwhelmed when I think about not being with her anymore….\n\nI feel like my friends are trying to gently steer me away from this when I mention it, I fundamentally know that this is adverse to my safety, goals, happiness and ultimately… Life. But I feel so confused and overwhelmed by what the hell has happened over the last 7 years….\n\nBut I also know that I can’t trust her to provide me with clarity on this and I won’t love myself if I stay…. I also think that I can objectively understand that I probably don’t really know who I was with for 7 years anyway…\n\nShe was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder a few weeks ago… Which I had suspected for around the last year anyway…. But I think that I have had and still have a lot of empathy for her with this. I understand that these are challenging disorders….\n\nBut I also understand that abuse may be linked to these, but it isn’t always…. Sometimes (maybe I am being naive) people with disorders like this set boundaries for themselves to avoid this…. I feel like everything about this situation is devastating…\n\nI feel like I am mourning the idea of what I thought that my future was, my extended family of 7 years, I am losing one of two of my dog babies… My home… I know that I will gain a lot too… I just feel so devastated.\n\nI have reached out to a few different services (queer help services for domestic abuse, sexual abuse, general counselling, my uni and medical services for my health) and I have tried to maintain a schedule of good sleep, small nutritious meals, drinking water, gentle stretching, proper quality time with my dog daughter and maintaining social connection…. But I feel so sad and lost……\n\nThank you so much for reading my mammoth story… These communities and the support that I have received so far has seriously helped me maintain my stability over the last week and for many years now…. I hope that you are okay in your situation currently….\n\nIf you would like to connect or share your story with me, please do… I would love to compare coping strategies and ways to love ourselves and communities through the struggles that we are undertaking at any point in the process…. ❤️\n\nJacey",

He come off awfully charming to most people so it is rare that he’s held accountable for his actions. Recently, however, he was caught cheating on his girlfriend, and she decided to post him on a local Facebook group where other women also told their stories about their encounters with him and it is driving him crazy to the point where he wants everyone to feel sorry for him and of course I don’t. he tries to make me feel bad for not having any sympathy or empathy towards him and it honestly has made me feel really drained. I genuinely don’t see any real empathy that he has for the woman that is hurt. I’m more so see the shame that he feels about it being a public forum all of this has had an effect on me. It made me think about how he even treated me as a friend. I guess my question is should I continue living with him?",

This is a very small and even a silly thing but when it is repeated frequently trust me it doesn't not feel good and able to be ignored. And today I am in so much hurt while making this post. I just can't suppress or take it anymore.

        "Text": "I am writing this post because I am struggling to find a lawyer pro bono in Georgia that can help us get all of our belongs being held hostage. Even with a year long Protection Order sadly the courts only care about the order in that moment and not about the physical items needed to survive after escape. It’s often overlooked that the abuser withholding vital belongings or sentimental possessions is an attempt to continue contact in some manner. I want to permanently move on from this and I am struggling to because we are struggling to survive. Sadly I have went through all of the resources I can find myself in Georgia or Alabama. I am desperate if any can help with resources, names etc. Thank you all for taking your time to read a bit of our story and may god bless you all💕 I 23f and my 2 children under 2 have recently escaped our abuser 34m in March of this year. We attempted to escape 3 months prior but all of the local shelters/safe houses were at capacity. During that time he found a to-do list I had made vaguely describing some of the tasks I needed to do in order for us to leave such as using my laptop to research free housing organizations, pack up some of our specific items like birth certificates, my sentimental items like my dad’s ashes and photos and other things like that. When he found the list in the trash he confronted me and then immediately went around the house to collect the items he had read about and anything else he could think of that myself & my 2 children would need to leave, he smashed my laptop to the point where it was obvious it was done intentionally despite his claims that my 10 month old baby had done it. He put it everything in the locked basement including the diapers and formula needed for the children in that moment. I did not have a key or access to the basement at that point because 2 months prior he changed the locks to only the basement after the 1st time I told him we wanted to leave because of the abuse. I’m not sure if this matters but he did this by simply switching the door knob that accessed the basement to only a deadbolt that was turned the opposite way, to which I had no key. I called the police and they made him bring the items back upstairs and they left. We stayed for another 3 months until a shelter had a vacancy for us 3. We left that day with the help of DFCS who also put a safety plan in place for what they listed as a threat of violence in front of the children. The day we left happened very quickly and there was a lot of odd coincidences that took place for us to be able to leave that day. I won’t go into too much detail but coincidently I just so happened to call DFCS that day in hopes they could find us a shelter with an opening. She told me that they actually had a case worker headed to my home at that very moment for a surprise visit because someone had made an anonymous report of his abuse to me that was in front of my kids. I’m assuming this report came from someone within our church whom I was openly asking for help. I am grateful to God and my community, government and everyone else who had a hand in helping us escape permanently that day. Despite having the win of physical freedom I struggled that day and since because we had to leave everything we owned except for some of our clothing. We only were able to get the clothing because I in detail explained the extent of his abuse such as his need for me to sexually “trade” him for each and every item that myself or our children needed in our daily lives. I would have to perform sexual acts that he decided were worth $15 for one, $5 for some other etc. However much money the items in the store costed like 25$ for a box of diapers for 1 child, I would have to “trade” for Beforehand. This situation also applied to any utilities I used for myself or the kids like using running water for a bath, water for washing bottles, laundry, also electricity like running the dryer or using the overhead lights in the home all had to be “traded” for. If I did not complete the sexual acts then we were forced to be without those necessities. To also give some context I had my own car but wasn’t allowed to use it unless I “traded” for gas money prior. My family and church members would attempt to gift us necessities like diapers, food, gas money etc and he would withhold it until I completed my end of the “trade” This was all done in his explanation because I did not provide financially to the household. Again for context I was forcefully impregnated both times having forced to be a stay at home mother while he went in and out of employment. I had a car previously provided to me from my grandparents who raised me, I also had food stamps and WIC and had PLENTY enough to cover food for the 4 of us but we remained continuously hungry and I had a constant job of finding free food in the community such as food banks etc. This is just one example of the type of abuse we endured those 5 years this example just showcases his level of financial/sexual abuse.",

        "Text": "Hi all. I’m looking for some advice — I will try to keep this short to avoid getting upset as I write.\nI survived a narc relationship that ended Jan 2020. The pain was made worse because I lost a parent in Nov 2019 (yes he used this against me and to manipulate me further) and I was a real wreck in spring 2020 grieving all of this. I am fortunate to have found a trauma therapist specializing in narc abuse who I have been working with since, and I have built an amazing life (slowly) since then.\nMy absolute best friend was going deep into her own narc relationship as I was coming out. I will spare the details for her privacy but as a result of her relationship our friendship deteriorated, though we never fully lost touch. I felt abandoned by her during the worst and lowest point in my life, though I DERPLY understand what she was up against with her narcissistic partner, since I had my own experience with mine. I tried desperately to get her out of this relationship once I saw what he was doing to her but you know how it is, that was never going to work. So I stopped trying to save her and focused all of my attention on my recovery. She has been with him since, and the abuse has escalated over the years (we would hang out every few months and I would get the updates then).\nShe is now starting to come out of this fog after being discarded by him. She is in a lot of pain and we are starting to see each other more and I’m learning even worse details of what he did to her. I am trying to support her, but I feel so much pain myself about the loss of my friend for 4 years — she really did just disappear from my life as I was grieving losing a parent, getting discarded by my narcissist, being gaslit by my entire workplace (narc and I worked together) and having to leave my job to get to safety. She was there (we lived together), but not present, her whole head was dominated by him and she was very unreliable and distant because he controlled her life and he despised me. I am not blaming her — I know the nuance of this type of abuse — but I still feel such grief over losing my best friend for four years, especially at that pivotal point in my life. \nI now feel a bit brain scrambled over how to proceed. She has not gone no contact. She knows now the reality of who he is (though she has further to come for sure) but she is being hoovered and still controlled by him in little ways. She is back in my life more full time and I’m trying my best to support her, but I need us to heal our own relationship to move forward. I am the only one in her life who has gone through something super similar, and I want to pass on what I have learned from my experience and from working with my narcissistic abuse therapist for 4 years, but I’m in so much pain myself because I’m having to face the depth of my grief over our friendship disappearing for that long. I need to heal with her in order to move forward, but I also just want to ignore the past and be best friends again because I’ve missed her so, so much and I just want her to be safe from this horrible guy.  Every time I see her I get sad because all of this grief is coming up. Im so scared of building a relationship with her again and then her disappearing into him again after getting hoovered back up. Im torn between hope and the reality of most women going back to their abusers. I also don’t know if she has the brain space to have an honest talk with me about my experience of losing her and the deep pain that came with that. So I’m wondering if anyone has advice — my therapist says I need be careful and keep my distance to keep myself safe, since she could go right back to him (which would mean she would leave our friendship again because as mentioned before he despises me for never buying his act, and I also get too triggered by their dynamic to be able to spend time with them together anyway) but it’s hard to keep that boundary when I see her struggling and I know how painful it is. \n\nThis wasn’t short at all, oops, but if anyone has any words of wisdom or support or similar experiences to share I am all ears ❤️\n\nEdited for typo.",

        "Text": "To sum up a long story, I was in a one year relationship with a very abusive narcissist who also happened to be my first boyfriend. He cheated on me, gaslit me, was physically abusive to the point I had to get a restraining order, etc. It took me a long time to stop going back to him even though I realized this cycle of abuse. I have been no contact with him for 7 months and have blocked every form of contact he has tried. He finally moved on and stopped contacting me about a month ago and this led to me creeping his profiles on a fake account (I realize this is also wrong).\n\nHim getting a new gf at first was a relief because I do feel like I have reached a point where I am horrified by what I allowed to happen to me. I still can firmly say I do not want him back. But I do still check up on his profiles on my fake account regularly after I discovered he moved on. It’s a horrible habit and I know it’s negatively impacting my mental health since he’s gotten a new girlfriend. Mostly because I noticed he introduced her to his family right away, which is something I had to beg him to do in our one year relationship in which he still never let me meet his siblings. They have moved in together in 2 months and she even got his name tattooed on her chest. I know this is love bombing, it’s insane, and it’s not something I want. I just somehow feel bothered by it and I don’t want to regress into feeling sadness about this relationship. I know I would never want to go back but it still bothers me. I also realize I should stop checking up on him. \n\nI guess I just need some thoughts and advice on how to get over this feeling that they might be treating their new partner better than me as well as the panic of “what if they were never really a narcissist” even thought the relationship was extremely abusive. \n\nI have recently been into trying to think about everything as an opportunity for growth, and I do see our relationship as a positive learning lesson for me. But how do I stop these negative thoughts from creeping in? I keep doubting myself and even questioning if I was doing something wrong in our relationship. \n\n",

        "Text": "So I’ve stuck by this saying my whole life, you aren’t a tree if you don’t like where you are or what’s happening then move.\n\nHere’s the thing, two under two. Financially and vehicle dependent as it would break us financially for daycare. My home was broken into a few months ago while we were out of town, that’s its whole own thing. As a SAHM I feel ungrateful as he is working and only talks non stop about how he has to work etc. He sleeps until he wants, I need to have his medication ready for him in the morning also with his nicotine habit and rub him while moving my hands enough. I’m a smart human and I know what this is, however I feel like the reasons I stay are our children. They’re happy with him, he plays with them and I just do all of the things. There’s no use discussing mental loads, capacity for houseworks or divvying of tasks. I’m fortunate if he takes out the garbage. Now you may be thinking “OOF she IS an idiot” don’t worry:\nIt gets better, or vastly worse depending on your POV and sense of humor. We have slept on his mothers floor every weekend for 1 year now: I was able to coerce him into buying memory foam beds for the floor at minimum as months of sleeping on a patio cushion was becoming intolerable. At home my kids have every thing they need. He’s not permitted to stay at my rental due to outbursts and attempting to smash a ring camera. He has called my mom a c word and told her he can’t wait to read her obit (that’s just the latest not the list of things), as he feels her rules are what’s separating us. He thinks I’m smart but consistently asks me “are you even living in the same world” etc etc. due to differing POVs. I frequently find I’m just staying quiet to not create issues. Frequently commenting on weight and how I feel any and everyone. Salsa fell out of the fridge and he sent me a photo of it: bc it must be the way I put it away, nothing can just be an accident. I came back to find he had covered it with a towel, and a hand towel. (This was yesterday btw which lends to me writing this post). I haven’t listed out the explosive tendencies that have made me fearful, he doesn’t hit me, but I’ve cut my hand on broken glass more times than I can count. Sex is a mandatory (which I get is not abnormal but it’s coercive and not enjoyable even though it’s sexually gratifying) I’ve tried it all. I’m in therapy. I force it.\n\nI left it didn’t stick bc I thought that there was true change. Hooks are back in and I understand I deserve better and all of the things, I just feel like he can provide them a life I can’t. I’m willing to handle the abuse so they can have a life with both parents in it. I am trying to validate staying to have a “man on the inside” as he is decisive and will manipulate them around me when the time comes. Since the break in the children and I have been staying here at his mothers every night at his insistence, and spending the days at “home” so we can still be with our animals etc. I agreed to this as I empathized with\nFeeling powerless over not being able to protect them etc. I tell myself his bark is worse than his bite and he’d never hurt us. With that being said, I have concerns of harm/muckduck should I break this bubble of life, my own happiness isn’t paramount, I’ve lived unhappily the majority of my life. Again I read it all and it seems like a lot (I convince myself it happened over time so it’s not that bad but the violent outbursts are every 6 weeks if not sooner) but I also am feeling ungrateful. It feels way overly dramatic even writing this. Im stuck. Mentally and physically.\n\nI’m officially a tree. ",

        "Text": "I have been lurking here for a little over two months.  I went through something for the last year and a half that culminated on my birthday in July.  To explain it I need to build the back story because there is always a back story.\n\nA co worker and I in mid 2022 became very close.  She was married F38 and I M50 started working on projects closely.  After talking to her casually I realized she was better than what she was being used for.  She said that her female bosses kept her down.  She did all these things and no one appreciated her which is why she could not break into a director role.  At the end if that July I asked her if she was willing I would coach her and we could get her to director, we did in Q1 of 2023 she got the director role.  (She works in Customer Experience and I was Cloud Operations). She accepted.  Shortly after my father was given a month to live a late diagnosis of lung cancer.  I was devastated.  She seemed so empathetic and was constantly reaching out to make sure I was ok.\n\nAfter my father passed we continued to talk.  Text mostly but then that October it turned into Voice.  Apparently her husband had been traveling and I remember the day so vividly.  After hours of conversation every day and countless text messages, I get a message “the Situation comes back tomorrow, I am going dark….”  I was in shock.  We were not doing anything but talking.  After about 24 hours she pings me I can not not talk to you.  I was so relieved.  I felt the same.\n\nThe last week in September 22 I went to a girls birthday party and told her about it….lets call her (F38) Grasshopper for clarity.  Grasshopper’s demenure totally changed.  She was still responding but asking for pictures and come to find out that she was quite upset that I was doing something with other people.  The next day we had a long conversation about it and she let out she had caught feelings.\n\nShe tried to make it clear that nothing could happen, she was married, and she wouldn’t be a home wrecker.  I said ok but I had feelings as well but I will respect it.  As time went on I knew she would be going to a user conference our company was hosting in Novermber at a hotel in Las Vegas.  Being a director in Operations I was able to get a pass but paid my own way.  I just had to meet her, to see if the feels were real.  She was not opposed to this and actually encouraged it.  So the plans were set.\n\nThe first time I saw her at the Cosmopolitan hotel she was behind me, we had arranged to go for a walk on the strip.  I was walking and she said I just got off the elevator.  I turned around and there she was.  It was….fireworks.  I was shocked when she gave me a massive body to body hug….she was not my type.  To coin a phrase from my friends, aren’t there unmarried mousey cute librarians where you live?  There might be but she was…anyway.\n\nThat day we ended up walking 17 miles.   Up and down the strip, just talking.  That was the true start of my relationship with a covert narcissist. Nothing physical happened on that trip.  A lot of staring, a lot of brushes of hands and shoulders.  There was physical chemistry yet I respected her saying nothing could happen.  I did try but not ton hard on the last night.\n\nWe both went home to our lives, but the texting and calling didn’t stop.  Through December it continued.  I was smitten.  She would go silent and talk to me staring out the window waiting for the “Sitch” to drive into the drive way.\n\nI was in a tough place.  Here was the woman of my dreams.  She was concerned about me, my father’s end proof of that.  She was encouraging and in her words torn.  She told me that an episode happened with her husband in Aug of 22 that let me in.  She wanted kids because her corporate dreams were a lie.  She thought she was pregnant and her husband drunk said thank god you were not.  M36 said I don’t want kids I am too old and so are you can you imagine F that.  That is what let her feelings for me in.  In December 22 just before New Years she asked me to come see her in a place called the Dells.  If you know where it is cool.  I said I could.  She said it could be only a few hours but to me it was worth it.  She had told the sitch that there was a company meeting there.  There was not.\n\nI got there and the first hug was again electric.  I knew I only had a few hours but it was worth it.  We laid on a couch just talking.  Ended up laying on each other.  No kissing happened she made it clear that could not happen.  She kept teasing me so I teased her.  When I knew it was time that she was supposed to go back home she said she had a surprise.  She could stay the night.  Lots of kissing and rubbing happened.\n\nI was very conscious of things that she had told me about her not liking the physical or kissing or any of that.  That her situation would make her watch porn so “she could fill his bucket”.  I thought she had trauma so I went very slow.  It was a magical night.  The next day she couldn’t stop kissing me.  It was the beginning of my spiral of being love bombed and future faked.\n\nOver the course of the next few months when her situation was traveling I would fly to her city and stay with her in their house.  We would play loving family.  I would make her breakfast and do all the things.  The physical ended up with all the things.  When I say all the things I mean all the things.\n\nI always told her I couldn’t be the side guy forever.  She needed to make a decision.  She would tell me I love you I can’t imagine a day where I don’t talk to you at least once a day.  We would go on business trips together.  She would visit me in my home state.  We would stay at Airbnb’s and drink champagne and make love in hot tubs.  The entire time her telling me that she loves me deeply.\n\nShe told me that the room we stayed in, in her house was Our bedroom.  She had moved into that room and the sitch didn’t like it but she just couldn’t.\n\nMarch 31 2024 she told me that the sitch had found out about our affair.  That he had connected to CarPlay in her car and listened to all our text messages.  She was staying with an aunt and uncle and they were getting a divorce.  That she felt like a piece of shit.  I was concerned and accommodating.  That is a lot to take in.  However, after that communication became a trickle.  Trips were not planned we had spend at least a week together every month for almost two years.  I would ask what changed.  You’re separated and filing for divorce why is everything no more forced.  She Gaslit me and said I was unstable and that her aunt and uncle were busy bodies and what not.  She would send me selfies with no wedding ring on etc….it was all part of the lie.  At the end of June 2024 I was literally losing my shit.  My birthday was coming up and not a conversation about plans to see each other.  Three months since we had seen each other.\n\nWe planned on a trip to Milwaukee for my birthday July 8 but she had a bacholorette party for her sister to attend.  Everything felt off, the sisters wedding was real but everything else was off.  So I went early.\n\nShe told me where she would be so I was there, she said she didn’t have a her car and had not seen her husband since March.  I watched her go back to the marital home that day.  It had all been a lie.  Every bit of it.  I was devastated.  Absolutely devastated.  After asking her to just tell me if she was going to stay married I would walk away she just lied about everything.  She wanted her cake and eat it too.  There is more to this story but seriously I am struggling to just write this.  I just need to get something out there.\n\nThank you for reading if I can I will explain other parts and particulars I just needed to word vomit this out there someplace.",

        "Upvotes": 11,
        "Text": "For context, I (22f) and my now ex boyfriend (30m) were together for 4 years. He has two kids with another woman. The woman and I got along fine 99% of the time. Had our moments of course, nobody is perfect. Took equal care of the kids and co parented well with her. The two parents, barely spoke, especially during the 4 years he and I dated. She and my ex both told me it was easier to communicate through me rather than just talking with one another. This caused a lot of strain in our relationship because I would voice that the kids were clearly suffering from their parents lack of respect for, and communication, with each other. I was also uncomfortable being the medium between the two of them when they’d get into physical fights or screaming matches. \n\nEx and I moved in to our own place first year we were together, this went fine however after a year my ex lost his job & we had to move out of our apartment and into my parents house. For background, he wouldn’t let me have a job since he wanted me at home 24/7 (even if the kids weren’t there). Basically 1940s house wife vibes. I really took the time to care for my parents home and made the kids rooms up perfectly for them on a budget. Eventually we brought one of them to live with us full time at my parents house and let the kid go to school over here. Lots of behavioral issues in school, choked another student, laid another one out in class, etc. I advocated for his child’s IEP (individualized education program) while no one else did besides my parents. The child’s mom never showed up to any of the meetings, not a single one. The dad (my ex), unwilling signed the paperwork thinking it would ruin the child’s life and make them “a retard.” Turned out to be the best thing that happened to the kid and excelled in most of the classes they put them in for the extra help. \n\nFlash forward to the end of the school year, around May 2024. Child wants to go live with mom again because dad is “scary and yells at us a lot.” Which is true, my ex had a temper and was extremely passive aggressive with the kids and myself. I protected them a lot of the time and defended them no matter what. They are just young kids (both under 10) and really don’t know any better a lot of the time. They’d come to me for EVERYTHING. From tying their shoes to reading books with them. The kids knew how to do these things but liked the attention I would give them. Which I was okay with being that person for them. Kids mom had a habit of having more kids when the other ones weren’t cute and little anymore. So they loved the one on one attention and care they would get from my parents or myself when mom and dad wouldn’t give them the time of day. \n\nWe went out of state for my birthday and took both the kids. They had never been to this place before and we had a lot of fun. I spent probably 900$ on our hotel room for the four of us for 3 days, 2 nights. My ex paid for parking, food, gifts, etc… However, on my actual birthday, he proposed to me, but not like you normally would down on one knee. Nope. He looked at me dead in my eyes and said “wanna get married?” in the most unenthusiastic way. The kids were both running around screaming and it was super uncomfortable for me. I told him no and the relationship went south from there. \n\nBroke up about a month later and he was an a**hole. I mean, seriously flipped a switch. He was still living with my parents and I, every day he was harassing me for not wanting to be alone at the house with him. But honestly, he was scary. Unlocked my bedroom door in the middle of the day and walked in on me naked, trying to get with me. He sent me horrific text messages and even a video of us having sex I didn’t know he took. Weaponized the kids against me saying “everyone abandons them” and “you’re just like their mom.” I was furious. I took care of them for 4 years with her?? All he did was throw money at me to care for them and then would drink and play video games all night and all weekend, completely ignoring them. The week before my parents kicked him out, he was blaring music in their house when I got home…I could hear it from the driveway. So, I come inside, knock on the door. Ignored. Knock again. Ignored. I open the door and his hands are covered in blood and he’s doing whip-its (nitrous oxide/laughing gas). I turn off the speaker and he’s mouthing the words to a song while holding a gun to his head. Wild. Called my parents and they came home immediately and told him to pack his shit and go. \n\nI felt so bad for the kids, still do. I just hope they are doing better with their mom. He needed help, but anytime I asked him to go check himself in, he would just say “if you ever try to get me help, I’ll go out in a hellfire of bullets before anyone takes me anywhere.” and that was that. I never tried to push the issue.\n\nAITA for breaking up with him over what seems like years of mental abuse to his kids, baby momma, and myself? \n\nNote: This is just the tip of the iceberg but it was never just about me, the kids were so important to me and I just didn’t want to leave them alone with him… that’s why I stayed. Just need to know I’m not crazy for leaving them. I feel so guilty. It’s racking up in my brain everyday. ",

It seemed like every time I would try and engage the father about his daughter and the narcissistic behaviors I’m encountering with her, he would act like he couldn’t understand the wrong doings of his daughter. Sometimes I would even try and set up a one on one / man to man conversation with him about his daughter, and he would avoid. My question is, does the father or parents of the narc know their child is problematic? Or do they think their child is innocent? It seemed like when their daughter was around, they would not tell their daughter ways on how she needs to change. It was almost like they needed to show their daughter that they have her back regardless. This caused conflict to never ever get resolved. The narc thought she was always justified in all her wrong doings. Never admitting fault. Never apologizing for things. Never wanting to let the silly disagreements go. Wanting to be in control of everything. Hanging up the phone when you want to discuss her wrongdoings towards you. Silent treatment for weeks. Would return and act like nothing happened. Would call me out of my name on several occasions. Destroy all special events/days and vacations. Her parents made it seem like I was the one causing all of the problems. For 5 years, the narc would never change her behavior. It seemed to get worse. At times, I was pushing myself to be in overdrive to accommodate all her demands that she would still turn around and destroy if something didn’t go her way. The endless tantrums. ",

        "Upvotes": 7,
        "Text": "I recently went through a breakup that’s left me emotionally drained and full of questions about the relationship. I'm hoping for some advice, insight, and a little outside perspective from this community because I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting and I’m trying to make sense of what really happened.\n\nBackground:\nI was dating a woman (38F) for about 3.5 months. I’m 38M, and from the beginning, we seemed to hit it off—common interests in food, music, humor, and travel. However, it wasn’t long before I started noticing red flags, but I didn’t act on them because I wanted to believe in the connection we shared. In the end, I was left feeling confused, devalued, and unsure of what went wrong.\n\nThe Red Flags I Ignored:\n\nShe has a history of divorces and trauma. She’s been divorced twice, has a son with a history of suicidal thoughts, and has had a lot of challenges. I was compassionate and empathetic, but it felt like her emotional burden became mine to carry.\n\nShe’s financially well-off but didn’t contribute. She made about $50,000 more per year than me, but I ended up paying for around 80% of our expenses (trips, dinners, etc.). When I brought it up and tried to address it, she got extremely defensive and said that it was a trauma I needed to work on with my therapist. I thought I was asking for equality, but it was treated as though I was out of line for even suggesting it.\n\nDismissal and devaluation. She constantly implied that I was \"lucky\" to be dating her and had high expectations, often mentioning that her doctor said I should be grateful to be with her. It made me feel like I was always trying to prove my worth to her, but no matter what I did, it wasn’t enough.\n\nLack of emotional safety. Whenever I tried to bring up concerns, whether about finances or how I was feeling, she either dismissed me or turned the conversation around to make it seem like it was my problem to work out. It made me feel like I was walking on eggshells. After one particularly tense conversation about finances, I completely shut down because of how defensive she got.\n\nMood swings and medication issues. She admitted to having PMDD and was on Lexapro, Adderall, and regularly used marijuana for anxiety. She had crying spells almost every time we were together, and she’d say she was overwhelmed by everything, including our relationship. I started wondering if the meds, combined with the weed, were making things worse.\n\nQuestioning my worth. At one point, she asked me, \"If I don’t need your money, what do you bring to the table?\" That comment stung, especially because I was trying my best to support her emotionally, but it seemed like it wasn’t valued. The conversation was framed around her expensive lifestyle (she loved taking trips and wanted a partner who could keep up with that), and it felt like I was being held to a standard I didn’t agree with.\nCropped me out of photos. She edited a selfie we took together and used the cropped version as her social media profile picture. I don’t know if this was intentional to hurt me or if I’m reading into it too much, but it felt like a sign that she wanted to be seen without me.\n\nWas this Narcissistic Abuse?\nThere were moments where I felt like I was being manipulated—like when she cried and said, \"I love you, but I’m not in love with you,\" but still begged me to stay. There were also times where it felt like she was trying to keep me around for what I could provide, emotionally or financially, but without truly valuing me as a person. Her dismissiveness when I brought up concerns, constant mood swings, and the way she would flip the conversation to make it about her started to make me wonder if I was being gaslit or emotionally manipulated.\n\nNow I’m Wondering:\n\nCould she have narcissistic traits? The constant devaluation, defensiveness, and expectation for me to cater to her needs made me feel like I was never doing enough, and it became emotionally exhausting.\n\nAm I overthinking this? Part of me wonders if I’m too sensitive or if I’m being overly critical of someone who was just dealing with her own issues.\n\nWhat should I have done differently? I realize I didn’t speak up soon enough about my concerns, and I regret not setting better boundaries or standing up for myself more assertively.\n\nTL;DR:\nI ended a 3.5-month relationship with a woman who seemed to constantly devalue me, expect me to shoulder most of the financial burden (despite making more money than me), and didn’t provide emotional safety when I brought up concerns. She exhibited what I believe are narcissistic tendencies, but I’m unsure if I’m being too critical or reading into things too much. Looking for insight and advice—especially from those who’ve been in similar situations.\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.",

So, when I try to tell him how I feel when I'm upset, he ignores me and tries to tell me I'm bipolar or have signs of various mental illnesses. Sometimes he gets upset and takes it as an insult to him if I told him he made me feel upset, then starts freaking out threatening to break up with me if he makes me so \"unhappy\". no? I'm sorry your bathroom is dirty and it bothers me.. he legit tried to break up with me over me saying that. \"stay the f*** away from my house.\" and then leaves me begging for him to calm down and not leave me. it's been like this for a few weeks, I really feel like I'm walking on eggshells when I speak to him. I told him \"if I was suicidal that would have drove me to do it.\", then he told me \"guess what I knew.\" and tried to play it off as something else. he told me he didn't find me attractive as I don't have feminine and elegant qualities and got upset when I got upset over it. \"I don't see you as a peer, you aren't an equal.\"\n\n\"You say I'm nonchalant all the time, but It's because I don't like engaging when things are tense\" (he said when I asked him why he doesn't care or respond when I'm sad.)\n\nI'm seriously considering leaving him as I cannot deal with this any longer. it's exhausting; especially when I'm going through a depressive episode. (probably due to the way he treats me.) ",

        "Text": "The narcissist has no self. The narcissist has no personality. The narcissist has a hollow schizoid core. \n\nYou, the anxious, trembling covert have no ego. No self. And no personality. \n\nAll these people around you and I’m the only one that’s figured out why you’re childish. Why you’re so grumpy. Why you’re so gullible. Why you absorb the personality of the women you date. \n\nIt’s because all narcissists do. \n\nNarcissism is a trauma response. \n\nSome psychologists argue it’s not a personality disorder, because narcissists don’t have a personality. They borrow their personality from their primary supply. \n\nThat’s where your south side accent came from. You posed as the Streetwalker during your month long silent treatment. \n\nYou devolved from scientist to Streetwalker. \n\nLike a transformer.\n\nGuess what else? \n\nThe narcissist has a mother wound, and they recruit victims to help them replay interactions with their mother and other improper caregivers. \n\nOver, and over. \n\nRemember when you gave me the book K from your job gave you? \n\nThe neglect that you faced made you this way. \n\nI feel bad for you, a little. \n\nYou say you used me, but what exactly did you gain? \n\nWasting your time trying to prove you’re a family woman? Taking me on vacations to pretend like you care? Paying the bills pretending you could support a family? \n\nSounds like you came to a net loss, if you ask me. \n\nI think the Streetwalker bears a lot more resemblance to your mother than I do. \n\nI have zero in common with anybody you know, except for the fact that you like brown freckled girls. \n\nLike your mom? \n\nYou treat your mom like crap, and you treat your romantic partners like crap too. \n\nThere’s one distinction between them and me. \n\nThey’re still trapped in the fog.\n\nYou were very convincing. Once I came to Iowa I quickly saw the indicators of infatuation, and I knew the result of it. So I let it play out, watching you play yourself. \n\nIt mostly disappointed me and hurt me, \n\nBut that’s why I stopped buying you gifts and thats why I didn't give you any money. \n\nI know you don’t enjoy art, or plays, the symphony, haute cuisine, flowers, or anything else I’m into. \n\nYou put on a show for me. What benefit is that for you? \n\nIt must suck to not be able to love anyone, and to have a “gotcha” at the end of every relationship. \n\nIt must suck to have toxic enablers that aren’t really your friends, that pass you alcohol even though you’re clearly allergic to a lot of it, to keep giving you coke even though you clearly have an endocrine disruption that’s making your hair fall out. \n\nFinally, after this long road I’m at the end of thinking about you, caring about you, and feeling sorry for you. \n\nNarcissists resist self awareness and therapy. \n\nSo you’re going to continue meeting women that remind you of your mother, with that sugary sweetness, and trying to curb stomp them emotionally like neglect does to a little girl. \n\nI wanted to help that little girl. \n\nBut I’ve gotta help myself. \n\nUnfortunately for you, you’re going to break a lot more Mama T look alikes before you take a deep look at yourself. \n\nMay God have mercy upon your childlike soul. \n\nHappy Birthday, and goodbye. Goodbye emotionally, goodbye spiritually, goodbye energetically. \n\nIt was the last tie and I’m so glad I can finally cut it. \n\nSnip sniiiiip! \n ✂️ ",

So I write this knowing full and well that I deserve better, that I am wonderful and amazing and people actually do like me. I know I’m not worthless, ugly, and unwanted. I also know that I’m not without fault. Part of me is terrified because he might see this, and the thought of that confrontation has me on the verge of a panic attack. The other part of me is cheering  me on, hopes he sees this so I can heal. \n\nI never believed I was going to change him, I thought the him I was seeing was it. I thought he was understanding, and safe. He wasn’t. He was love bombing me into believing that, so I would tell him all my insecurities, hopes, and fears. He used that to make me think he’s the only person who cared, who truly loved me. I was lost and broken and alone, he got off on feeling like he saved me. But I’m the one who saved him. I’m the one who pays for everything. I’m the one who takes cares of him. He does odd jobs here and there. And I’m supposed to act like he’s single handedly saved the world, because he brought home $75. When we argue I’m not allowed to bring up any past instances because he “can only go off of what is happening right now”. So I can’t even have supporting facts to my arguments. But it’s perfectly fine for him to bring up my perceived injustices and tell me how I’m not acting right in our relationship. If I say anything he doesn’t agree with I either have an attitude, or because he doesn’t believe it I’m wrong.\n\n I feel like I’m fighting for my life just to be able to wake up and hate myself. He tells me all the time that I shouldn’t keep things inside and breed resentments. “I tell you everything, I don’t understand why you can’t do the same” it’s so hard to explain to him that he can tell me anything because I cultivate a safe space for him. I don’t react to things, I don’t make him feel foolish, I don’t invalidate him. And I’ve tried telling him he invalidates me, and his response is that I’m the one not thinking logically. The only illogical thought  I have is not leaving.  I keep telling myself I will. I guess now I am waiting for him to change. ",

I met my boyfriend 11 months ago, he quickly moved in with me after a week and started saying he loved me after a month and that he wanted a baby. We were fine for a few months, I paid for every date. He was a pretty bad alcoholic and would use my card to buy alcohol, but I didn’t mind because I love him. I got pregnant around 7 months of us being together and he begged me to get an abortion. It broke my heart because he was the one who wanted the baby and asked me to try for one. I was pregnant for two months and he cheated on me with 15 other women. He came over one day and told me I would ruin the baby’s life and he would resent me for having it. I ended up having the abortion which broke my heart. He promised to be with me while I lost our baby but he ghosted me for a month while I lost it alone. He was still using my card while we weren’t together. He spent over 400 one week on alcohol and fireworks and gas (fourth of July weekend). He started texting me back after the month of ghosting. He came over every few weeks just to hook up with me. He was with multiple girls but every time I would go on a date he would show up at my apartment drunk calling me a whore and a slut. I love this man and forgave him again. He has started to move stuff back into my place and has stayed with me the past 7 days. I ordered new cards and within 3 days they were missing from my purse. He had them in his wallet. I truly love this person but I feel like i’m being used :/ :(. He doesn’t tell me he loves me anymore, we don’t have sex (we used to multiple times a day every day), he has me blocked on all social media. But he lives with me. I’m very confused. I’m getting resentful, it feels hurtful to come home from work to him having played video games all day. When I get home from work he always wants me to buy him food or buy him more weed. Can anyone give me insight as to what he is doing. He seems to not love me anymore, but he doesn’t want me to move on or he causes such a huge scene. He lives with me again but doesn’t show any affection or help with any expenses. I don’t know how to talk to him about it because he would just leave me and go to another woman. I am in therapy but my trauma bond to him is extensive . He has maxed my credit card out ($5200) and i’m living paycheck to paycheck to support me and him.

It is not easy for her to compare things because she is always forgetting at least one of them.

He’s apparently had to give our son albutrol multiple times due to night time wheezing fits and complained about how our son keeps coming to him sick. He is not sick when I drop him off but he admitted that he is not giving our son his Flonase for allergies so I’m wondering if him not giving the Flonase the first night is causing our son to have allergy symptoms to come full force at dads.\n\nHe proceeded to tell me that despite just saying that our son has symptoms in both houses and he’s sick a lot, that our son actually doesn’t have any symptoms and I’m not accurately discussing things with the doctor. He has only ever complained to me about how bad our son’s allergies are at his house, our son doesn’t have allergies at my house. The entire reason our son has been put on medication is because I’ve been taking his complaints seriously and reporting them to the doctor when I hear of it.\n\nThen ex began telling me that I needed to give access to MyHealth because I’m not communicating with him enough even though I am telling him everything to do with our son in person, over text, and sending a doctors note. He’s decided not to give our son (3 years) his prescribed medication and has not given it to him in almost five months apparently. I was not made aware of this, I have full custody and medical decisions while my ex has access to medical records. He’s saying that he needs MyHealth so he can talk to the doctor directly but doesn’t that take away my rights? I’m giving him the information through three sources and he’s still not following it?\n\nIt’s not a situation where I am not giving him the information, he is choosing not to follow the allergy action plan and is blaming me for some reason. I’m angry because I found out that he’s been lying to me, he’s blaming me for our son having a cough at his house (like I can control that), and that I have four days to give him MyHealth access even though I’ve been super forthcoming. Also now I have no idea if Jack has allergies or not. I assume he does and my ex is just lying now because the complaints of symptoms have lasted longer than being told that he has no symptoms. And the conversation also started with him complaining about our having symptoms of being sick and he must be sick at both houses and when I explained why that might be when he told me he wasn’t giving him his medication suddenly our son has no symptoms and I’m lying to the doctor to get our son on unnecessary medication…. \n\nWhat do I do? My son needs his medication, he’s been hospitalized in the past whether or not he’s currently showing symptoms is not a factor. He has asthma/allergies and we do not currently know the trigger. The doctor and I am trying our best but I don’t know what to do because now I’m finding out that during our medication trials, my ex just stopped medicating our son even though he has a persistent cough, stuffy nose, watery eyes (ie allergies).

You helped me through this. You helped me escape from my abuser, reveal to me that I’m a codependent, and helped me not place all my blame on my abuser. \n\nYes, she is an abusive, terrible, ugly woman with no heart, \n\nBut she only did to me what I let her. \n\nBy now you know that I’m deeply spiritual and I believe God brought me this deeply painful lesson. \n\nLike the narcissist, codependents are trapped in a loop of pouring into others instead of themselves. The codependent suffers from an anxious attachment and a need to control which we achieve by targeted altruism that hopefully leads to our desired outcome. \n\nUnfortunately I met someone whose pain and internal battle presented me with such a challenge that my codependent brain went bananas, \n\nTrying to love a narcissist with no love inside them. \n\nI was always my own. I was always a child of God. I deeply needed me and the fullness of God. Instead I went off chasing someone with so many demons, and such bad karma. \n\nI saw bad things happen to her and she was genuinely puzzled as to why. \n\nBad people do have their evil ways come back on them. People that are stupid, while you may want to help them, have to suffer the consequences of poor decision making. People that lack impulse control and that are selfish chase how they feel in moments, their commitments be damned. \n\nA narcissistic abuse survivor is forced into growth, that’s the only way out. For those of you just starting your journey, let it hurt. Welcome the pain. Don’t “just move on,” because we can’t. \n\nYou have to put in the work to come out of this, to stop the rumination, to reclaim your mind. \n\nI wrote 16 songs, some of them are pretty damn good! I wrote an entire book, I cried, I sang, I prayed, \n\nMost importantly, I took a deep look within. \n\nThe people we allow into our lives are a reflection of who we are. \n\nI allowed in a predator because I was a walking open wound, \n\nA deeply sad and desperate woman willing to hurt other people to win a “prize,” \n\nA narcissist that will be the last of them to become self aware and work on it. \n\nIf not for her though, I would have continued my cycle of codependency, seeking validation in toxic friends, families, and relationships with people who like to take.\n\nWith mosquitoes who need to sip on the blood of others for their own nourishment. \n\nThe day before I moved out of my abusers raggedy house, she stepped over her new mattress to pick up a “you pick two” from Panera her recycled supply sent to the house. \n\nDamn, you couldn’t send the whole sandwich? 🥪 \n\nI said to myself “so the cycle starts again. She tells everyone how nobody ever does anything for her.”\n\nShe told me the same thing. And so I sent her edible arrangements and meals, a 200 dollar hoodie, all kinds of food, wine, and gifts to her because she told me “nobody ever had.”\n\nI learned that people stay lying. But for Cluster B, it’s not a lie. They believe their own fantasy, that’s why they’re so compelling. \n\nA covert narcissist’s trauma dump is the inverse of a grandiose fantasy. \n\nA famous narcissist may say “we will build a big beautiful wall that Mexico will pay for!” To get you to believe in him.\n\nThe covert says “nobody has ever done anything for me ever, my cat has cancer, my mom hates me, my ex is neglecting me, help me!”\n\nIt’s the same manipulative move. \n\nOne is just quiet. \n\nNow I know better, \n\nNow I can do better.\n\nAnd with that yall, \n\nI’m gone. \n\n❤️🦋🔜",

        "Upvotes": 9,
        "Text": "If you’re a narcissistic abuse survivor, you’ve probably stumbled across Richard Grannon, the virtual nemesis of HG Tudor and Sam Vaknin. He is just as good as explaining narcissism as the narc him or herself. \n\nThe difference is, like many of us, Grannon grew up in the fog, learning how to please people who could not be pleased, run on the treadmill faster and faster for those who are never satisfied, and other training exercises that make bullshit palatable, and the narcissistic fog comforting toxicity. \n\nHe has a simple yet elegant theory that narcissists live in a state of psychosis. If we took out the loaded word “narcissist,” that has come to mean so many of the wrong things none of which have to do with narcissistic abuse, what the victims describe would in fact be considered psychosis. \n\nWhen I was with my abuser, I chose to turn the other cheek because I thought that by not fighting I could bring the woman I love closer to me, and show her that I was not her adversary. \n\nWhat I got in return was reactionary paranoid that was completely unfounded. She used to say “you don’t know me” when I would pin her down. I studied quickly because I thought I could help her in whatever she was fighting. I didn’t know that she was actually fighting herself and reality. \n\nI figured I out pretty quickly, maybe within 3-4 months, that she was severely lacking in empathy. I thought maybe she might have ADHD or be Autistic. That was a misguided assertion, a crapshoot to explain the bizarre and capricious barrage of emotions I witnessed. \n\nSo in my anecdotal testimony, I absolutely agree with Grannon’s theory that the narcissist lives in a state of psychosis. Like him I tend to attract the covert and also histrionics, because I’m very patient and I’ve been groomed my whole life unbeknownst to me to enable their state of psychosis. \n\nI do notice that the people I love are delusional and unrealistic, have delusions of grandeur that are unlikely to come to pass, and that I cheer people on in their moments of grandiosity. \n\nWhen people beat up on me emotionally, I turn the other cheek, continue to tell them how great they are, because as a codependent that was raised as one I don’t know any other way to love. \n\nGrannon says you should “abandon sincere communication with the terminally insincere.” \n\nThose are words every narcissistic abuse victim should digest and live by. \n\nWhen I was growing up, my N father had all of these circular argument tactics. Some people say I should be a lawyer. Because I never get tired of an argument. Arguments don’t upset me. I’m so used to being berated in every way and having every idea I have shredded into confetti,\n\nIt’s nothing to me. \n\nMy X pwNPD claims we argued so much. It’s hard for me to see it that way. \n\nI was only trying to help. I’m asking questions like “why are you upset? Why don’t you have empathy? You seem to be exhibiting the markers of someone that is infatuated, not in love. Have you thought about it?”\n\nThat’s not an argument. In my opinion, those are good faith questions you should ask if you’re in a relationship. \n\nWhat I concluded is that these questions triggered a narcissistic injury which doesn’t feel good to the narcissist. Anytime you ask them to look at themselves it hurts.\n\nThat’s what narcissism is. \n\nAs Grannon explains, narcissism is a shield from reality. \n\nAnytime you question the false reality of the narcissist, you’ll get an explosion. \n\nIt’s extremely exhausting being suspected of emotional terrorism when you’re simply trying to understand that person. \n\nNarcissists take your attempts to understand and characterize their inner workings as a threat to their reality. \n\nBased on Grannon’s theory, I see why my abuser got so upset at my questions and sees me as argumentative. \n\nBy asking her to describe what love is, or asking her if her life is purpose driven, \n\nI’m threatening her fragile false self and pushing pins into her bubble of narcissistic psychosis. \n\nIf it were me, I’d be so happy anyone cared enough about me to try to figure me out. \n\nFor a narcissist, that’s a level one threat.

He got in my face and screamed at me more to get the fuck out of his house and then hugged me and then shoved me again and screamed at me to get the fuck out of his house and knocked over a lamp. \nI replay this situation in my head constantly and can’t figure it out this single incident is constantly living in my head feeling horrible about but also feeling like it was abusive. He told me I escalated the situation and I felt I did too because I wouldn’t let it go. What are your thoughts? Thank you. ",

In the beginning of the relationship he was super nice and really a perfect boyfriend. He was pushy sometimes but if I said stop he’d stop. He left for boot camp after two months and wrote me everyday while in boot camp. He got out and was nice and then got to tech school and started being disrespectful and I found inappropriate texts that he said were jokes. I broke up with him. I come to find out he had only been broken up with his last girlfriend a month before he started dating me. and also lied about his body count (he said 0 but other people tell me more) after I broke up with him he had another girl in his lap a week later and now he tells people he didn’t love me and he doesn’t care about me. I’m just unsure and there’s probably some stuff I’m leaving out. Just need an outside perspective. He may have just been using me but why go through the effort to write me everyday and call me when he got calls at basic and also spoil me. Why wouldn’t he have just broken up with me? Sorry everyone this may seem stupid I just can’t wrap my head around it",

You never once told me to my face that I’m beautiful. You never once told me to my face that I’m sexy. You never cheered me on or hyped me up. \n\nWhen you cheated in that cruel way, after you treated me so poorly and embarrassed me, broke my heart and talked shit about me, spread lies about me you thought I’d never hear but your friends are sneaky and disloyal, after you gaslighted me and tried to make it seem like it was my fault, \n\nYou said “I treated you good.”\n\nI know based on your texts there was more going on but I didn’t even care to try to ferret out more details about your whoredom. \n\nI would say in 22 you treated me well. The New Year brought out that devaluation. \n\nYou treated me like dog shit. \n\nI’m trying to deal with it. It hurts everyday. \n\nWhen I tell people I lived in Chicago, they envision me in the West Loop or River North, the lights, and the parties. I never got taken on a date there one time. Yet I only “cooked twice a week.” If I didn’t cook we didn’t eat because you never took me anywhere at all. You never made me a damn thing. You went to work with lunch every day but you never sent me to work with one damn crumb.\n\nI told myself it’s because you can’t afford to access what Chicago has to offer, which is okay with me. \n\nBut really it was because you already knew when I moved there you didn’t want to be with me, and you thought you were going to take my money and save yours. You were willing to stay with me even though you hated me so you could keep squeezing me.\n\nI tell my family in friends yeah I was in Chicago, but I was in the laundromat cleaning out moose tracks out of old ass boxer briefs because our unit had no washer and dryer, not partying or seeing any of it. \n\nAnd you and your friends talk about how I didn’t do *enough* laundry. \n\nI know you can’t stand the fact that you gotta do it your mothersucking self. \n\nAll of my other exes are decent people. Of course it didn’t work out but I think all of them are people of great character that I still love and respect as human beings. \n\nI have zero respect for you because you’re a liar. You don’t understand yourself. You have no identity and you’re a poser. I watched you become a woman you claim you couldn’t stand. When you went back to the Streetwalker, I saw you absorb her personality. I saw you create a blaccent I never heard before. I saw you shake and shiver in low supply status. \n\nYou’re disgusting as a human. \n\nI’m going to tell you something else. \n\nThe more I think about that shitty apartment, those flannel sheets, that old mattress, that ugly ass cactus painting above your aunts literal death bed, and how cruel you were to me, \n\nSqueezing more and more servitude out of me, asking for more, asking me if I would be willing to move to Oklahoma City or Pittsburgh because you were too chicken shit to go on you own, \n\nNot because you really wanted me but because you know I am smarter and more accomplished than you, and you thought through the osmosis of manipulation you could harness this to your selfish ends, \n\nI get sick to my fuqn stomach. \n\nYou knew very early you didn’t understand me when I talk. \n\nYou should have said something. \n\nBut you are too insecure to admit to yourself that cheating your way through high school and college, \n\nThat getting a piece of paper but not having the knowledge that’s supposed to come with it has caught up to you.\n\nNow you need to be a savvy communicator to advance to your next level in life but you don’t have the skills \n\nBecause you’re a fraud and a cheater. Because you’re dishonest. Because you used other people and didn’t do the work.\n\nWhen you had the urge to reach out to the Streetwalker, \n\nYou weren’t forthcoming about it because you know I’m strong enough to walk away from you. \n\nYou weren’t ready to be alone because you can’t be. \n\nAnd now you are anyway. \n\nYour plan backfired on you because of the uniqueness of your idiocy, \n\nAnd now you have to pay all the bills and for the repairs in a house you never wanted. \n\nBuying that house actually set you back financially at least ten years in opportunity costs. And now you’re tied to a terrible boring ass city you don’t want to be in alone. \n\nThe best thing about it is that’s not even the karma. \n\nBeing trauma bonded to a heaux that’s an even shittier, slower, less intelligent person than you is the real karma. \n\nIt came to pass a lot faster than I thought it would. \n\nKarma’s just getting started.

Once I got to the battered women’s shelter I found out this is his third felony domestic assault in ten years. \n\n\nEverything was a lie, or was it? I have no idea what was real and what wasn’t. Was he paranoid and delusional or was he manipulating me? \n\n\nThe control he had over me was absolute. He knew everything I did, everywhere I went, everyone I spoke to. He accessed every digital conversation, every photo from now through years and years of my past. My phone was bugged, my laptop is still bugged. I finally tuned it on and everything is gone except for a list of every single online account I’ve ever had and the passwords in an excel spreadsheet sheet left open for me to find…and a code that automatically boots up my camera and my mic. \n\n\nI got a new phone, my friend who he doesn’t even know got a new number and a line for me to use. He found me. He said “I will always come back to you” \n\n\nIn the last days I found out he had been a drug dealer and that he had abducted someone by gunpoint and “left them in a field”. Did he leave them alive? This man who had worked non-profits, on campaigns, organized community outreach programs, taught English in a developing country. This is the man I fell in love with who dissolved into an obsessive, controlling, cruel, and horrifying person who was beneath those noble and good things.\n\n\nI get notifications that he is logging into my accounts from “unknown devices” from IP addresses that belong to the county court house. \n\n\nHe is watching me. He is going to come for me as soon as I leave the shelter. But I have to leave. My children need me. The children he played Barbie’s with and taught how to feed the ducks. \n\n\nHe is coming for me and I don’t know how to prepare myself. He’s a big guy, muscular and tall, he’s a physically powerful person. He is armed. He is unpredictable. \n\n\nHe has evaded arrest for over a month. He’s incredibly intelligent and obsessed with me. \n\n\nIt sounds like a scary movie. I’m going to become an HBO special. Every time I contact the police they say “there’s nothing we can do, we have officers looking for him but it could be years before they pick him up.” \n\n\nI have a counselor. I have a psychiatrist. I’m in the shelter. But I have to go to work. I go pick up my kids to spend time with them. I go to group meetings. I’m always looking around, searching for him. Every person I meet…I begin to panic. Were they sent by him to collect information, to spy for him? He’s so charming and manipulative. Did he put a tracking device on my car? I’ve torn it apart looking, but he could have hidden it so well. Did he gain access to this new phone? Do I need to get a new one? A new number? How did he get my new passwords? They’re completely random? \n\n\nHe worked in cyber security but lost his job and all of his focus, his every waking minute became monitoring me, my every single move. \n\n\nI don’t know what to do. It feels like the authorities and the legal system are just throwing their hands up. Is this only going to be over when he gets me? \n\n\nI feel collapsed in on myself. I trust no one. I’m scared to even post this. He’ll see it. But so what, right? But I’m so ingrained with the shame and the guilt of even having these feelings. \n\n\nSomeone just talk to me? Please? ",

It also bothers me how quickly she noticed I updated anything. I didn't even mention her. She's been stalking me for years and it's distressed me so much. She claims that she's gone to the cops about me, that she's told her boss about me. She is constantly defaming me and telling everybody I am the one stalking her. She hadn't mentioned her \"stalker\" for a few weeks since I logged off of all of my socials, but the day I posted the photos again, she started back with the \"my stalker\" nonsense. I really need to get some school work done. I had a lot of little goals set aside for myself today but for some reason I just feel stuck. Like no matter what she's going to keep stalking me. She's going to find her way back around me and harass me again. It's so disturbing that I affect her this much. She usually posts something in her photos that absolutely creeps me out. For instance, once I posted a photo of me in a room with a red light. She posted herself sipping a red drink. This time, my hair is a bright, blue color. She posts herself holding a bright blue purse. She's so weird! What do you all do to get over these freeze states that narcs intentionally put you in to bring you down?",

I moved to this man’s country after 4 months and still he had a hard time saying we were boyfriend and girlfriend, that it was a “relationship” but he rather us not do boyfriend and girlfriend because it “messes things up”. It made me uneasy and cause fighting, I felt like I was in tryouts to be this man’s wife. I was literally living with his parents for a couple months. He even had me with him every single daily everywhere in his life. He wanted me in his office all day while he worked (I’m in music so I do my own schedule for work), I accompanied him everywhere etc. \n\nI am confused because narcissists usually push fast for commitment.

They then said that they had to work this last Friday out of no where, when their place of employment is not even open on Fridays… My ex then asked on Friday if they would be able to pick our child up on Monday. I then explained that I had made prior plans and am having family over today. Of course, it turns into they are having phone issues again and asked their parent to ask me if it was possible for my ex to have our child for today. I explained to them that I have made prior plans, as this is my scheduled parenting time. I used to always give in, however I ended up very very sick earlier this year and I was admitted to the ICU the weekend our child went with their other parent. I masked my ex if they would be willing to have our child one extra day, as I was in the hospital and that was the only day I needed our child to stay with someone as I had the rest of the week figured out. I was told no, they have work and it is not their responsibility to find a sitter. My ex then proceeded to call out “sick” (not sick whatsoever) the whole entire week. However, any time now that my ex asks a day or two before they want our child, I have started saying no. I feel horrible, but at the same time, I am the one who constantly has to pick up our child’s broken pieces, because my ex is always breaking commitments. Our child does go every single time with their scheduled time. But if I say no to extra time, I am met with how horrible of a person I am, and that they will take me back to court, call the police, and call CPS on me for hiding our child from them. I am just loss on what to do anymore. ",

The prince charming facade, the academy award winning act of being the most generous, loving, devoted, devout Christian husband who stepped in and behaved as if he was a father to my daughters from another marriage, ever since they were three and five years old, to now that they are 11 and 14, had them call him Dad, his parents Grandma and Grandpa.... it was all nothing more than an act. \n\nAll it took for this mask to slip, for the verbal, psychological, and physical abuse to set in was any time I had a certain look on my face, any posturing that indicated I was \"having an attitude\"... any time I shared that I was angry, or I disagreed, or I didn't like how he had treated me. He snapped into a rage, he used every weakness or vulnerability I ever shared with him as a weapon to tear me to pieces. It only ended when I broke down, admitted fault for his actions, and for so long, I genuinely believed his behavior was my fault, if only I didn't do this or that, everything would be perfect. \n\nI finally worked through my own healing until I just woke up. I saw through all of this for what it was. And I was going to stand my ground. I would no longer tolerate a life where he controlled everything, especially our money, kept me isolated in the home as a housewife with an online job, isolated from everyone, even his family, just completely cut off and dependent on him so he could shout at me, you can't live without me, you're too stupid, you're too weak, you can't afford it. \n\nThis past weekend I finally said no, I was having my paycheck from my online teaching job deposited into a separate account and we could work together on our finances and move money as needed, but I wanted control of the grocery budget and the child support I received for my daughters because he had gotten so controlling he began to try to limit or deprive me of money to buy groceries, literally berating and belittling me because a burnt grilled cheese had been thrown in the trash which proved I didn't deserve grocery money because I wasted food. \n\nHe flipped into the most violent unhinged rage I've ever seen and remained in it for two days. I locked the door and he took a drill to open it. He cut the power off in my room to prevent me from doing work. As an act of retaliation, he took all of our money and moved it into some secret account I had no idea he even had. I still didn't break. I insisted that this was what I was doing. I said I was keeping our grocery delivery service because I work constantly online and I need groceries delivered to me. He went into a brand new violent rage over this saying he was going to go to the store himself and buy the groceries himself and bring them home. I wasn't even allowed to go to the goddamn grocery store at this point, I realized. I continued to say no. \n\nThings finally got so bad I told him he needed to leave the house because I was done with him behaving this way in front of my kids. I'd never gone that far before. \n\nAnd so he left. But he wasn't going quietly. He pulled a huge hoover feigning apology saying let's work things out, blah blah blah. I realized that due to my financial situation that actually leaving was going to be more traumatic for my kids given housing and food insecurity and such I was afraid of a lot of things, so I accepted the hoover.\n\nHe came over, brought pizza for my girls, had a family dinner with them. He even helped my daughter with her math homework. He came outside to leave to go to his parents and said \"I have planning to do, let's talk tomorrow.\" \n\nWithin 20 minutes, I got a call from my parents letting me know that he had called them to let them know that he was divorcing me and was coming to get his stuff that weekend. He didn't tell me until later. \n\nThat monster came in and played on my daughters' emotions and made them think everything was going to be okay as his final act of revenge agaisnt me for resisting his control. I had to go in and explain to them that he just let us know he was leaving us. They were devastated and confused, they couldn't make sense of it, saying but he was just here, he was just acting like everything was okay. \n\nThe worst part of all, he just started teaching at the Christian school my eldest daughter just started attending and I was having to depend on him for rides for her to school because of course I have no car (I am getting one). My daughter finally broke down and said she couldn't go back there, it was too much, it was too upsetting. \n\nSo... I am taking back my life. I asked her what she wanted to do. She said she wanted to go to the public high school with her best friends. So I am in the process of making that happen and she never has to go back to that school with him again. \n\nMy parents are helping and supporting me and finally saw through him. And on top of just abandoning us and in such a cruel way to my children, I asked him if he would please help me to transition so I didn't risk losing everything trying to pay all of our bills myself because all I wanted was to keep stability for them.\n\nHis response? No. I need all my money for myself. \n\nHe's worse than a monster... he's the worst kind of coward, to traumatize my daughters by putting on such a show then dropping the bomb to my parents not even me that he was divorcing me and coming to get his things this weekend ot move out. To just abandon the family he had lead and supported as a husband and father which as a Christian man this is the highest and most serious responsibility, to just drop this bomb, set up time to collect his things, and just walk out on us without looking back, not caring if I ended up homeless and losing my children (which I won't but thank God I have a supportive family). And to do all of this at a time when my 14 year old daughter had just started this new school where he'd started teaching and was having a wonderful experience which was just absolutely ruined, destroyed, blown to pieces because he decided to blow up their whole world. \n\nMy daughters and I are strong together. We always have been. My eldest daughter is excited to not ever have to go back to that school because she said she never wants to see him again, that he's absolutely evil and she can't understand how someone can be so evil. My youngest daughter who is my best friend who goes to school online while I teach online and we are so close-- she got over it quick, finally said, Good riddance! I hated him for how he treated you! I was so tired of listening to his stupid shouting mouth! \n\nImmediately, they expressed an unanimous decision: they began calling him by his first name and said they will never call him Dad again, and they don't want to ever see him again because he's evil. \n\nWe are going to be so much better off. And it feels like there is no justice, that these inhuman heartless people get away with everything, destroy the lives of people who have done nothing but love them, stomp all over the people and do all they can to crush them, and then walk away scot free once their damage is done.\n\nI honestly do believe that there is a God up there somewhere, and even if he has the whole world fooled like he had me fooled.... his first ex-wife was crazy and abusive, his second ex-wife was crazy and abusive, I actually pitied him as a man who was abused, not an abuser, despite how he treated me... now he has a third ex-wife which is me who he will have a whole new round of stories to tell about how I'm crazy and how I abused him.... he's 52 years old. And this is his life. I mean... holy shit. \n\nIt hurts but... my God I'm so glad he discarded me. We are going tobe better off and my daughters and I are going to heal together. \n\nAnd someday, because I do beleive there is a God, the day will come once he leaves this earth that he will be held accountable for all the devastation and harm he has wrought on innocent people. I have to believe that. \n\nBut we escaped, we're free, and only good things are ahead of us now but.... my God. How is it possible for a human being to be so soulless and without any heart or conscience? Especially ironically enough all the while pretending that he's such a paragon of righteousness. \n\nWhat's most fucked up is... this is supposed to be some kind of very conservative Christian school, but yet... they are going to let him keep his job there. It is going to become clear in the next week that his stepdaughter has just vanished from the school. The girls that she told what had happened are going to spread the story. The administration is aware of it. The other teachers are aware of it... \n\n...But they are just going to go ahead and let him keep teaching there. \n\nI could go on a whole rant about legalistic fundies but... I'll save it because I'm sure everyone who reads this knows. This should probably be somewhere in the DSM as a subset of a type of NPD. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\n\n\n",

You could even walk away from all those situations for years and it would cause all of this pain from being gaslit.\n\nHow the fuck is that someone else's fault if someone is a miserable sack of shit and being a bully?\n\nEven if you walk away, one day you'll have all this pain and panic attacks stemming from other people's fucking disrespect.\n\nThen when more narcissists see you in pain they will try to frame you and say that everything is your fault and you can control your panic attacks. They think they have the right to tell you to \"grow up\" or some stupid shit like that.\n\nThey keep kicking you when you're down.\n\nI personally feel like I can't even think straight anymore and have developed a panic disorder from people telling me that other people's disrespect was my fault and having panic attacks from it is ALL my fault. As if I can control it.\n\nVictim blaming has made me wanna kill myself, but why the fuck should I wanna kill myself when the selfish is succeeding in this world?\n\nOne of the only reasons why I'm still alive besides family and friends.\n\nNarcs need to fucking remember why they became worthless dog shit in the first place. The abuse that THEY went through turned them into scum and they'll never realize that they're continuing the cycle of abuse.\n\nThey're trash that didn't survive.\n\nI know for a fact I'm not perfect. I will always acknowledge that but they never do. I get angry if they refuse to see my side and then all of a sudden I'm a selfish attention seeker.\n\nWe still have to be the strong ones or we will become them. I feel like I'm trying to lift a car off myself trying to not hear the voices with my schizophrenia when this happens. I was ill and they kicked me when I was down.\n\nThe victim blamers need to shut the fuck up cause I was never this bad.",

        "Text": "Really need help and advice\n\nHello, I’m a 24 year old Male, and I feel strongly like I’m a victim of narcissistic abuse. I’m currently in the relationship still. But I would like to give a backstory and see if you guys believe this is narcissistic abuse, or if I’m just in an unsuited relationship, any help would be really appreciated \n\nSo me and my 33 year old male partner met a year ago, it was honestly the most special amazing way I’ve started a relationship, he was always there, couldn’t get enough of me. I’ve always been quite sensitive and felt lonely living alone and after 2 years single since I was cheated on by my ex, I was ready to find love again. He would tell me I’m the most beautiful guy he’s ever met, and it was very intense, after about 2 weeks of dating and spending a lot of time together he decided he needed to let me know him and his ex were still close friends as they had a special love for each other as they helped each other in dark times, they only split at they decided a romantic relationship was not working for them. I wasn’t totally comfortable with this as I must admit I’m a little insecure and the thought of my partner face timing his ex daily did worry me.\n\nAfter around 4 weeks it was time for him to travel half way across the country for a work reunion dinner, he was fine before he went and as this is where the ex lived I asked if he’d be attending, he answered ‘no I probably won’t even see him’ fast forward to when he’s there, it’s radio silence, he didn’t reach out the whole day until evening, which was very out of character, he finally did and told me he was at the meal, and he’d been shopping with a friend, and I asked ‘is HE there?\n And he said ‘yeah don’t worry tho’\n\nHe then ignored me all night which is fine you can have friends, but didn’t reach out till 3pm the next day, I’d been calling to find out if he was safe and well, and he just wrote ‘f**k off and leave me alone’ I was rattled by this. I was then to find out not only had the ex been there, he’d spent the whole weekend shopping and spending time with the ex and stayed over his house, hence not contacting me\n\nTo this day he assured me, nothing happened he just knew I wouldn’t understand and that he should’ve told me. I carried on with the relationship trusting it was just poor communication.\n\nHe then started saying I was lazy, I didn’t do anything with my life, even though I worked 24/7. Then he would say I’m ‘scratchy’ which in his language means slobby. And I felt this overwhelming need to prove myself to him. I was confused because this was a 180 from the beginning of the relationship. In the end I drive myself crazy, going to the gym filling my time with absolutely everything, but it never satisfied him, I was just doing it ‘to impress\nHim’ \n\nI then went to an important exam, and 30 mins before, he broke up with me over text, just said good luck with the exam but I wanna be single and do my own thing. I was distraught and barely scraped my exam. He knew how important it was. \n\nI then found out, while I was doing my exam he exchanged nude pictures with other guys, and planned sex with one. I went no contact for 3 days, and then he came back, pleading saying he made a huge mistake and he loves me and wants us to work. Again I took him back.\n\nThen came the end. We tried but I felt so insane at this point my days consisted of checking to see if he’d followed any guys I was just obsessed with the cheating, and didn’t trust him. After a night of him being rude to me. I decided I had nothing left to lose, and texted the ex. He had no idea I was his boyfriend, or that I existed, which I felt strange , as if they were best friends surely you’d tell him we’d been together 5 months at this point. I said I didn’t wanna be with him and I went no contact. \n\nThis lasted 6 months, however in May this year I lost my job, my best friend had moved away, I was low and felt at rock bottom. He turned up to ‘check on me’ out the blue and it started from there, he said he regretted ever losing me, and really showed effort for the first month, he removed half his followers on insta (didn’t ask him too) to prove he wasn’t interested in texting any other guys, and also said he wants to live together, at first I was cautious, but I feel so in love with the guy, I fall for him\n\nFast forward to last week, I left him alone at my place, while I went to a friends birthday, he said he needed a chill weekend alone, so i agreed to let him stay. He then proceeded to take d***s in my flat, and went on Grindr and was sexting loads of guys, my friend caught him on there, and he admitted it all. Now I’m unsure if he acted on that and had any guys over. But I’m so insecure about it, and I feel devastated. \n\nI went no contact for a week, but I’ve crumbled, he said he has drug issues and he needs my support to get better, and I’m the only thing that matters to him, he won’t drink again for me, or do any d***s, I feel hopeless, I let him back and he’s stayed over 3 nights, I know I should leave him, and get out, but it makes me feel S***dal, what if he doesn’t get better and that’s on me. I love this guy to my bones and i physically haven’t got the strength to leave. Just last night he was texting a guy on insta, and quickly dropped his phone when I glanced over.\n\nI need help and support, and rather than say GET OUT explain to me the best way I can do this that will be the least painful. I start my new job finally on Sept 2nd, I wanna put my all into it, but I’m currently in a bad way. I’m panicking.\n\n",

        "Text": "It all started because after I got off work I wanted to stop by T.J Max to browse before I went home to cook dinner. He called when I got off and asked if I was going to pick up food or cook and I said I'll cook. He just got home from the movies and said he was going to take a nap. Okay cool, this is my time to go out for a little bit, right? Wrong. As soon as I said I didn't want to take a nap with him he was upset. (He also gets upset when I do nap because \"all I do is sleep\"). Anyway after about 20 mins in the store, I decided that since we had a sitter we could go out to eat just the two of us. So I call him and he said he was on his way to grab food and I was like okay cool, let me pick you up and we can have dinner together. His response was, \"I'm fine, you didn't want to come home earlier so go shop\". I will admit that that I was a little hurt. I said I was done looking around already and he still continued with the \"I'm fine\". I asked why he didn't want to go with me and he proceeds to scream at my over the phone. Instant hurt. Instant chills because why do I allow myself to stay in this position with him. Anyway, he calls me back and then says he had already made plans the same way I did when I went to the store rather than going home to sleep and noted that I always want him to change his plans for me. Then asks me where I want to go eat. Like what. By this time, I've cried any my entire mood has shifted. The last thing I wanted to do was to go out in public and fake not being upset. I said he could go ahead and get what he had planned and good Lord, he then screams at me again and asks why and I fuc\\*ing with him and why am I making the situation worse because all I had to do was go eat with him. He then accuses me of being on my phone texting another guy because he heard clicking. Mind you, my phone was sitting on my steering wheel. Anyway, to avoid a long drawn out evening, we go eat and I go to my moms to pick our son up and I just visiting with her for about 20 mins when he texts me and asks if I want him to get a hotel for the night. I said no I'm talking with my mom and I'll be home shortly and he responds with \"if you don't want to be at home with me you can just say that\". I can't win. I have been receiving the silent treatment since then and that was about two hours ago.\n\nAs I'm typing this I realize it really all so sad but I find myself defending his behavior as \"he just wants to spend time with me\" or \"It wasn't really that bad\". I'm in a constant battle with this relationship but even more so with myself.",

        "Text": "Hi all, this is my first time posting. My (27F7 most recent relationship was long distance with a guy (24M) several states away. We met online through a dating app and I flew to him after one month of us being together. We had a wonderful time, everything was fine, he seemed so real and genuine. We did get pulled over when we were together and there was an issue with his license. I never felt like I got a real story from him about it. He always seemed just explain it so confidently but it just didn’t add up. He also had been telling me that he had classes on Saturdays but he never told me what they were for and I had assumed something academic. He acted like he had already told me, but “again” explained he saw a man hitting a woman and went to defend her and punched the guy. After that he was ordered to go to anger management classes. He had never told me that, but I believed him. After I got home, I was trying to communicate with him and ended up getting weird messages and got blocked. I sobbed and sobbed, trying to understand. The next day, he messaged like nothing happened and I immediately felt relief that he was contacting me again. When I asked what happened, he said he had to go pickup his drunk roommates (that he frequently complained about) and they were messing with his phone and must’ve done it. Relationship goes on. We continue our nightly calls and texts, still getting to know each other and enjoy each other. He keeps complaining about his roommates saying he has to pay extra in rent because they refuse to pay anything and now they’re all about to get evicted or something because they were short on funds. I wanted to be helpful and supportive and sent him some money to help (not much, i was a teacher at the time and we all stay broke). However after all of these things, he still ends up getting kicked out by them? So he starts couch surfing. He told me he doesn’t have a lot of friends. He has Asperger’s and is pretty introverted. It came off as endearing to me at the time. He somehow lost his job that he had when we first met (chef in a hospital) but said it was because his contract ran out (also when i was up there meeting him the first time, he took me to a way fancy restaurant, wanted to talk to the chef, said he was trained and would be opening a restaurant of his own soon which was news to me). Anyway. Couch surfing. Looking around for jobs. His attitude towards me starts to kinda change. I’ll go ahead and say I am very clingy and need a lot of reassurance. I basically was begging him to reassure me things were ok and we were ok because of the way he’d come off towards me. We talked about breaking up a lot. It was rough. He came to visit me a couple months after my trip to him, but I had to pay for his flight. I had lent him money multiple times, some of it explicitly with “this is a loan and i need to be paid back” with empty promises I would get paid. Never happened. And he could never bother to thank me for trying to help him? He wouldn’t explicitly ask me for money but he’d bring up various different things going wrong and would act like he could tough it out, but it seems like he knew I’d offer to help him so he could just count on me to be a piggy bank. And when I called him out on never saying thank you, he said he did (but I remember feeling hurt because to me it is a big deal and if someone offered to loan me $200 or whatever, I’d be so damn gracious. Idk if he really did and I don’t remember or if he was gaslighting me into thinking he did I’m not sure). Things were ok when he was here. He goes back home and the communication problems are still frequent. I was trying to get him to plan a virtual date for us. He asked me for a specific date and I agreed. Day of, nothing. I asked about it the next day and he said he forgot. Tried again, nothing happened. He finally seems to get kinda settled with a job and housing or whatever so I plan i fly up there again, but I had to tell him prior to that I still loved him but needed to fall in love with him again that he had had so many issues recently that occupied so much of his time and mental space I felt really forgotten. He seemed shocked at this. He would always talk about how he screwed things up and oh woah is him but he’d never really fix the problems. He might try harder for a few days and then poof back to his same ole. I end up going up there and I bought my flight but he did pay for an air bnb for us to stay in. Things started off great. He then decides it is time to tell me the truth about his classes on Saturdays. He told me that he and previous girlfriend were living together and things had gotten heated and he wanted to break up and leave. She stood in between him and the door (he is puny by the way, maybe 5’8 and skinny as can be not saying this is a factor in whether or not someone can be abusive but just to help set a picture) and he tried to push past her to leave and she clocked him. He continues to try to leave but apparently she keeps hitting him. He somehow calls the cops and they arrive to figure it out. He doesn’t wanna press charges just wants to leave. But she does want to press charges. So he was going to classes on Saturdays for domestic charge and decided he wouldn’t actually tell me till we’d been together 6 months. Side note, he said he was originally from the UK and snuck into the US with some friends in their teens and that’s how he ended up here but he didn’t really have any trace of an accent. He said he joined the army at 18 and I asked about it because I didn’t know if he could join if it wasn’t a US citizen and he told me he had dual citizenship because of his parents blah blah. I asked for any pics of him in the army and he never could show me any. But he loved talking about how he would get pulled over and usually they’d just look at his license and say “thanks for your service” and let him go. So much grandeur and said with the confidence that I felt like an idiot for wanting to ask questions when things didn’t make sense. And for him to be so much younger, he had claimed to live in multiple states and have owned different house and all this stuff that just seemed so far fetched. ANYWAY. I took a while to process. I was an hour and a half away from the airport with no car and didn’t feel like I was in immediate danger or anything so I just said ok and moved on. We ended up having adult intimate moments, for me, my first time ever (I have been on BC for years for PCOS and was taking it then just as an FYI) and he teared up after wards because he “had never felt so loved”. We later go bowling and everything is fine and happy. He has made it known he wants a family because he felt like he wanted to be a better parent than his parents were to him (mommy and daddy issues). I’ve never felt strongly about kids but if they happen, they happen. While bowling, I brought up that if we decide to do fun adult intimate things again, I’d like to get some condoms because I wanna be extra safe. (I know I shouldn’t have said this next part, but for me as a southern religious Christian woman, it is a real concern) but I told him “I wanna be extra careful because how do I know he wouldn’t get me pregnant and leave me to be a single mom?” And he shut down. Quit talking to me while we were out bowling. Drove erratically back to the air bnb when we left. I was crying trying to figure out why he was ignoring me. He did ask if I wanted food but at that point I’d lost my appetite. He finally said it was “because I know he wants a family and I should’ve known he would never do that” he dropped me off and said he was gonna go get a drink. Was texting me things instead of talking to me to my face. I was sobbing at the room. He heard me have a panic attack and did nothing. He left and got drunk. Came back and packed his stuff up. Locked himself for a while in the bathroom and wouldn’t respond. I started to panic because I was afraid maybe he had committed suicide in there (I knew he had depression and I have horrible anxiety and started assuming the worst) he finally came out. Still drunk. Said he’d go stay somewhere else and come back for me in the morning to take me to the airport. Then it changed into he would get an Uber for me to take me back. He went back out drunk driving. I kept begging him to come back and talk to me so I could apologize. Eventually he did come back and said we could talk. He was cold and still clearly drunk. But said the only way he thought we could get through this was to just forget about it and move on. Things were awkward the next day but we ultimately ended on an ok note when I went home. It wasn’t until I met with my therapist that I really realized how traumatic that trip was for me. She said of course he wanted forget about it and move on because he knew he way over reacted and didn’t want me to cling to that. We did somewhat talk about it later but I don’t know if he ever really felt wrong for how he acted. We try to keep going and he still thinks I’m his soul mate and the love of his life. He comes back down a few months later and stays for like a week. It was some good and some bad moments. He’d tell me he loves me and how amazing I am but that night he wouldn’t wanna even touch me when we were laying down. It felt like he’d purposefully lean away from me. Arguments here and there. Just problematic. He goes back home. He was supposed to have a court date to get an update on the progress from his classes and he quit responding to me. It had been like 24 hours so I decide to look through his friends on Instagram trying to find a particular friend of his to contact to see if my guy was ok. As I was looking, I ended up finding only fans girls he was following on Instagram and the half naked pictures he had liked. It broke me. I had been very upfront with him that I am against porn in a relationship. But I didn’t know I had to specify half naked women on social media. When I finally heard from him, he said he had spent the night in jail because he didn’t have confirmation of his classes or some dumb shit and they couldn’t get it till the next day. I told him I wanted to break up because I was so tired of everything and then seeing that he’s staring at and liking these pictures was it for me. “You want to break up over some pictures I liked on Instagram??? I didn’t even do it, *friend* did it because he was using my phone because his girlfriend doesn’t like him looking at that kinda stuff” I was done. He hung up. Called back quickly and said “if I can get *friend* to confirm it was him, can we stay together?” And I was unsure. I was so tired of being hurt but felt like I needed a valid reason to break up. He ends up sending a screenshot where the guy took ownership (I assumed my ex told the guy to do it and screenshot the relevant parts) so I said I didn’t want to be together. But it broke my heart and i kept leaning on him for support because I couldn’t quit crying and we never officially said we were back together but basically ended up back together. I still went through and broke up with him again around November. We kinda stayed in contact but at some point I told him i didn’t want to talk anymore I was done. Unfriended him on social media. He kept sending texts. He made a fake Snapchat to reach out to me with “the goal of making me fall for him again without me realizing it was him” but clearly I figured it out. I blocked him on social media. He had sent a few more texts up until like new years. Then nothing. In February he made a fake tiktok to reach out again. We chatted some and he clearly still had feelings and wanted to be together but i kept my distance. He still claimed he was going to move down ti be with me when he had stuff figured out and settled and saved money to. He told me he had one date while we broke up but he kept comparing her to me. He said he even checked himself into a facility to get some mental health help because he had gotten so low mentally. But he never bothered to ask if I had seen anyone or anything. I had in fact. No new relationship or anything but I’d at least been on a date and kinda had a fling. He said he had been to therapy (I tried to get him to go when we were together and he said he did for a bit but claimed his therapist berated him for how he treated me and made him feel bad about stuff so he quit going). So months later, one day, he said his therapist gave him the talk of writing a letter to someone he loved. So he wrote it to me and asked if he could call me and read it to me. It was beautiful. I teared up. He still thought we might be together again. He sent me a picture of it. Later read it to my bestie and she said it sounded familiar. I ended up googling it and he basically ripped off a poem by Whitney Hanson. I asked him about it and he said he missed me and that’s why he made it for me and he loves me so much or whatever. I called him out on it and sent him a picture of Hansons poem. He just acted confused and said “wow this doesn’t seem authentic now I’m sorry I’ll write you a new one” I said it wasn’t a coincidence it too similar. He said maybe he had heard it before and it inspired him. I said it was almost line for  line the exact same poem. He said he has “eidetic memory” aka photographic memory and maybe he had written her poem without realizing it. I just quit responding. He messaged back “are you upset?” “Hello?” And I finally responded the next day and told him off. To leave me alone and let me heal. Don’t contact me again. Blah. Before I could block him he just said “Tf?” And that’s the last I’ve heard. He’s blocked. No fake accounts yet. I just… I need to know what others think about this whole situation. I feel like an idiot for not trusting my gut early on that he was fishy. But I never had the confidence to call him out on his crap. He was so charming to me and confident and I just fell into his trap I guess. My therapist never met him, but she thought he was Narcissistic or Borderline Personality Disorder based off of what I told her. If anyone has any insight or any encouraging words, please let me know. I don’t really know what I’m looking for. Maybe sympathy and words of encouragement that I can find a real genuine man that won’t leave me feeling like that again. Maybe some confirmation that the hurt I’ve felt is real. Idk. Thank you all. I am sorry this is so long but I felt like I needed to just get this ALL off of my chest. ",

Why do people feed into the narc's social media posts even when they know the truth? \n\n\nFor example, my narc STBX husband posts a lot on social media about his sobriety. Every year he makes a post about how he hasn't touched a drop of alcohol. This is his 6th year sober. However, I found out recently he's been drinking the whole time. And I've looked back at all these sober anniversary posts and they're being liked and commented on by the people who have watched him chug back a whiskey and coke the night before.\n\n\nAnother example is I'll be talking to a friend about the abuse I've endured and they're horrified. For example, I confided in someone that my STBX had SA'd me multiple times but then the next minute I see them like or comment on a post he's put up about positivity and being a good person and loving all the authentic people in his life.\n\n\nIt's actually driving me insane. I (kind of) understand people not wanting to get involved/stay neutral but to go out of their way to feed into it when they know it's a bunch of crap confuses me. Has anyone else dealt with this?

Ive tried to talk to one of my best friends about what ive been through and she tried to 1up me trying to tell me she has been through has been worse because her bf asked to see her fucking tits... I feel like my whole world is crumbling around me and i have no one to tell. I have a friend who is older than me who has also been through narcissistic abuse and i talk to him sometimes about how i feel and he actually knows how it feels. But i dont want to rely on him. Mainly i dont want to remind him of the terrible shit he has been through every day just because im having a bad day. I think about my past partner every day and fucking everything i see/hear reminds me of him. Trains/tanks/guns/planes/forklifts/alaska/spagetti and even some jokes like \"what the sigma\" (i know its stupid). I have grown up in many manipulative spaces (some of which im still in) and i have such and unsupportive family, which just adds onto the load. I accidentally hurt my younger brother the other day and he said \"well thats why you date 18 year olds\" (he was 18) and everything just came flooding back. The next day he made fun of me infront of his friends because he saw cuts in my wrists and said i was emo. My friend couldnt come over mid day on a week day because my dad was already too drunk to be reliable and my mom was going out. My dad is a whole other can of worms (he is kinda abscent) but holy shit i just want something good to happen for once. I only have one person (of whom which i am interested in) and he is one of the only people who make me forget about everything. Him and my other brother, but he doesnt consider me a friend, just a sister. I dont know how to cope with this. I have been reliant on a lot of manipulative people to take care of my emotions and make me feel better so now that i am not in a manipulative relationship i have no clue what to do. I havent cried at night from lonely feelings since middle school and now i lay in bed every day wishing that i could just go back again and try harder with my previous relationship and maybe it could have been better. Its hell with him, but it feels like hell without him too. I thought that once i left him i would feel free, but i still feel tied to him. Sorry if this whole post seems like word vomit because it is, but i honestly dont know what to do. All my life ive been the supportive friend. I listen to everyone's side, i give them the benefit of the doubt, i take care of their emotions, but i just cant take it anymore. I can feel my personality change. I have friends texting me saying ive been acting strange because i havent been myself or i havent been texting as much and i just have to tell them im fine because if i tell them the truth im afraid theyll either hate me because of me trauma dumping or try to downplay my emotions. There has just been so much going on and i wish i had that person to tell everything to but i dont have anyone to do that with. So ill just lay in my bed doom scrolling hugging my stuffed animals for comfort dwelling on every bad thing that has happened to me. Thank you for reading, if anyone does. ",

He twists things on her, plays victim, has started many arguments between us and turned her on me several times, and when I went after he busted her head open he had pic lights hung throughout the room with their pics hanging on them.

I've spent the months after focusing on myself, having a routine, working out, meditating, journalling and reflecting on my boundaries and views on relationships and friendships even. \n\nBefore my narc I used to have a lot of casual sex which I enjoyed and never felt shamed for until he started slutshaming me on a daily basis before coercing or even forcing me to do things with him. There is this guy I was casually seeing before him that I briefly hooked up with who I had feelings for but it got complicated because of my narc ex. He also hated this person and put serious allegations on him that I till this day don't know if they're true but things got messed up.\n\nAfter my narc I feel like my views towards sex have changed and I feel like a lot of views I've ended up deeply internalizing. I feel like men don't respect women who have casual sex and while to some extent I feel like this is a common attitude I also see women who do it and own up to it. \n\nI'm now terrified of having sex anyway and would like to be super careful before choosing someone if I do consider it anytime soon but I recently ran into the guy I liked and it just messed me up so bad. I can't stop thinking about him. I still like him and he asked me over later but I know that it's just going to be to hook up and now I feel like he has no respect for me. I'm not going to do it but it and I should definitely take time off for now but all this is just very confusing. I have all these feelings but there's just so much shame and projection about how this person I like anyway thinks I'm a slut and this very easy person regardless.\n\nI don't think I'm ready to be in a committed long term relationship anytime soon and would like to focus on myself but I'm also terrified and ashamed of pursuing anything casual because I feel like I'm going to come across as easy and having no standards and lose all respect.

But sometimes when it's happening I wish I had a way to kind of literally fight it and stop it from happening in a strong way without being toxic. Mostly for the sake of our child seeing her dad effectively stand up against her mother without causing a blow up. It's like dealing with jekyll and Hyde because I never know when my ex is gonna be nice or extremely mean and usually mean last a lot longer. So any book recommendations would be appreciated.

        "Text": "I have recently gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship with a narcissist. We were together for 10 years. We have a child together and I am still struggling with setting boundaries. \n\nI have an amazing friend who has helped me every step of the way. From helping me realize that what I was experiencing was abuse to helping me and my child find a safe place to live. When my child and I moved, I purposefully distanced myself a bit from my friend. They provided me with so much support and I really didn’t want to emotionally drain them or take away from their personal needs and mental wellbeing. I saw this friend a couple times after moving but I was very mindful not to bring up anything heavy. \n\nA couple months after our last visit, my friend sent me a message saying we needed to talk. That they felt the distance and that I wasn’t letting them in like I used to. I decided at this point If they wanted the details that I could share. And honestly, I wanted to share. A few weeks after that my abuser started to stalk me and my friend and started telling me details of my day and my friends day that no one else would know. I shared all details with my friend about what was happening in that moment and as everything was blowing up, my abuser shared with my friend that we had slept together shortly after my move and other details that I was not ready to share with anyone. This separation has been hard for me as my abuser will not respect boundaries and continuously tells me that they are changing and working on their issues. I have been scared to be blunt with this person as we have a child together and contact is still necessary. \n\nI have felt so much guilt after everything that happened. I feel responsible for my abusers actions and I’m a burden or significant source of stress on my friend. My friend again got upset with the fact that I started to self isolate after this incident and told me I might succeed in pushing them away if I continue this behaviour. \n\nAfter this discussion I started therapy and took some other steps to help/protect myself (steps I won’t mention here just out of precaution) and since doing that my abuser did some pretty aggressive things that involved my child and scared me really badly. When my friend checked in with me the day after the incident I told them in detail everything. This was during work hours and they told me that everything going on was very heavy and that they needed balance. I understand that completely and respect that. I do know everything I am dealing with is a lot and hard for the people that care about me to hear. \n\nI promised myself to be very mindful not to vent or go into detail about everything during work hours but again I get the sense that my friend is disappointed in my choices in handling this. I know I am not in the right space mentally right now after everything that has happened and only moving a few months ago and I am probably missing bigger messages my friend is trying to get through to me. I guess I’m just really confused and looking for some input. I care immensely about their happiness and well being and I really feel I am a burden to them at this time and should back off. At the same time I am hearing that doing that will result in me losing them. ",

The last second conversation I had with her was she was asking me some money for any urgent work. \n\nShe cheated on me and left me as she found other guy. I tried to convince her for 2-3 months. I begged I pleaded I cried a lot. The pain I had in start was so immense I lied whole day on my bed crying. I thought I will never recover from that pain. She just wanted me for financial supply and when she found other guy for supply she didn't even think twice and left me broken. \n\nNow the day comes when I had my last conversation with her. I was done with the disrespect and reached my threshold I told her that she will never be happy and what she has done with me will come back to her and the guy with whom she is today she will leave him later or divorce him if she marries her or she will kill her if both the scenarios aren't true. And I told her to ask him for money and never call me back and blocked her.\n\nI want to say that money wasn't anything to me to give to her I would've given her anything if she asked. I was too hurt at that time else I wouldn't have even told her those things and left without saying anything. Today when I am not in pain my heart says to apologize to her for the words spoken and to tell her to live happily. \n\nBut the thing is why don't those people understand that love is really precious thing to find. If someone loves you madly and you aren't able to be with them there's no reason to devalue or disrespect them. Today I feel pain for the words I spoke to her why don't they care a little that what they had done wasn't good. It's the worst thing and pain a person can give to someone. If I am bieng truly honest the pain that I endured was more than I think I would've endured if she had died. The cheat devalue and disrespect was that much painful. \n\nMy only last words to them are that money and looks won't help you when you are old. One day you all will know that materialistic things never matter what truly matters is love and they are losing it every single time. Today I am back to my normal self and will love someone again but they are always in this miserable loop that only they can exit and no one else can pull them out of that. ",

Unfortunately, the courts don't care about the reason for divorce, and the child is forced to visit the abusive parent. My daughter and her Nex agreed to visitation every other week. My grandson used to have meltdowns at drop-off. Although it has gotten better, he still gets visibly stressed and upset when he has to visit for longer than a week due to agreed upon holidays, like the approaching Labor Day. \n\nI hate that he has to go through this.

I am in my late twenties, and never had much luck at love.\nI met this guy, let's call him Alex, he was the bartender and super nice to me.\nHe constantly followed me around, smitten asking if I needed help. I continously said I didn't. He then started asking questions about my kids, ex and to hang out.\nI wasn't sure but I agreed to hang out as just friends.\nHe wanted to get drinks but I was never a drinker. \n\nWell that one night led me to drink as he said just one but suddenly it was the next day.\n\nI was for sure he wasn't a good guy and did something to me. I blocked him and didn't even want ro work at the same place but I needed a job and he was there and of course insisted nothing happened. \n\nOver the course of weeks he constantly asked me to hang out more and more and caused problems for me at work by telling me things like everyone hated me there but him. And I already had low self confidence so I believed him. I thought I was a terrible server.\n\nThen by the end of the month I was homeless as I lived with my family and they moved and I couldn't afford to pay rent with just serving. I took on countless doubles and one day broke down telling him my story after he saw me get into my car one night stuffed with pillows\n\nAlex insisted I come stay in a motel with him only he didn't want my kids to come but we are a package deal. He eventually offered for me and my kids to come, so I did \nWe needed shelter and I was desperate \n\nThat turned into 2 months of hell. He got me to fall for him as he suddenly was charming and acted like a hero to my kids and I, but then suddenly he made me cut off my parents. Stop communicating with my ex husband. He kept my phone from me, deleted my family photos, he took off drinking daily and left me to clean his endless dirty clothes. \n\nHe demanded sex daily, and wouldn't let me eat unless I shared food with him. Like he would have to feed it to me. He would give me edges of bread but not a whole sandwich \n\nHe would say, \"do you want to be homeless, is that what you want? \"\n\nI didn't so I did as he said, when he said it\n\nHe took money I made for his car payment and he  caused bruises to the point that everyone was getting concerned \n\nBut I was secluded in that motel. My kids adores him at first but he changed quickly\n\nHe would make me feel so loved, and tell me how sorry he was and promise to be nice and not drink and then he'd flip over something so small\n\nIf my son had an accident he would ridicule that I didn't raise him right\n\nHe would ask for me to trust him to watch my kids but if I even went to pee he would neglect my kids and in 2 seconds there would be bruises on them\n\nI finally got out of the situation by when he was drunk saying I was going to take trash out and my kids and I ran outside. I got my phone and called my ex husband who came and picked us up and for a night we were all homeless but the next day my ex got us an apartment \n\nWe are currently with him, and I got another job but Alex found me and got hired on to serve there. I couldn't work with him again but again I needed money. He told everyone at work I was his girl.\n\nHe followed me to my apartment, put an airtag tracking me.\n\nHe has been so manipulative. But he would then break down, like when I found the airtag, he was so so sorry\n\nBut I don't know why he does this?\n\nHe's 25, and miserable without me he tells me...\nBut when I forgive him, he treats me like crap\n\nI ended up leaving that job too as he caused so many scenes. He was fired for sexual harassment but still I could not stay. He has costed me so much\n\nI feel like Taylor Swift and Post Malone, I love him but it's ruining my life \n\nWith that said, I found out I'm pregnant on top of all this. I tried to call him tonight to tell him at 9pm but he cursed me out because he was \"fucking taking a shower,\"\n\nI interrupted him so I listened for 2 hours as he blessed me out \n\nI told him I'll tell him tomorrow what I have to. I cried as hanging up. And suddenly he's texting he loves me, I'm his Golden haired girl. \n\nWhat do I do? Do I tell him I'm pregnant or no? And is he a narcissist or is it just I'm overreacting?\n\n ",

        "Upvotes": 10,
        "Text": "I call it the “why monster.” In the aftermath of narcissistic abuse, you ask yourself “why?” And then when you get an answer to that, the monster keeps nagging you to know why. “Why did he cheat? Why did she lie?”\n\nAt the root of most of the narcissists actions, the end of the “whys” ends at one low brow, low vibrating emotion:\n\nEnvy.\n\nWhen you were being lovebombed, the narcissist was not aware of their envy. The narcissist was obsessed with you. You were still perfect in their eyes, and thus an extension of themselves. Since the narcissist can’t love, they can only possess and manipulate you, the pursuit of supply is euphoric. It’s the closest thing a narcissist will ever feel to love. It is the most positive emotion they know, and that’s why the disorder will bind them to chasing it at all costs even if it destroys other aspects of their life. \n\nI’ve heard it called “the switch,” “the snap…” I heard one guy say “it’s like I wake up and I’m not in love anymore.”\n\nI just want to scream “that’s because that shit you feel ain’t love, sir!”\n\nBut yes, it’s that abrupt for them when lovebombing ends.\n\nAs soon as lovebombing is over, the narcissist instantly hates you. The narcissist hates you because the narcissist is envious of you. \n\nThat is why when you try to advance on the emotional connection and develop intimacy with the narcissist, you will get rejected. The narcissist will not let you access its vulnerability because their envy driven paranoia prohibits them from doing so. \n\nWhat’s sick about these emotion most of us feel from time to time, is that the narcissist cannot regulate them. \n\nThese emotions swirl around in their psyche. But the disorder blocks the narcissist from ever looking at itself as the cause or the problem. \n\nThe narcissist sits there baffled as to what you did to make them hate you so much, and what happened to all the love they felt yesterday. Last week, then last month. \nLike a swimmer caught in the rip tide, first they fight it. \n\nIt can’t be their fault, so they turn it on you. \n\n“What did you do with my feelings for you? It’s your fault I don’t understand myself!”\n\nTheir projection protects them from the harsh reality of introspection. You’re an emotional landing pad for their negative emotions. \n\nOh yeah, the narcissist blames you for its own confusion. The NPD is like a cloth on top of their mirror. Acknowledgement of envy is spiritually lethal for the narcissist. \n\nAt some point, the narcissist knows he or she is drowning. Who is the lifeguard? Who can make the narcissist feel good again?\n\nThe new supply. Oh yes. \n\nBut the narcissist can’t just say “I found a new supply, I’m leaving you, goodbye.”\n\nThe narcissist has to let you know that you are inferior first.\n\nThis part can be tricky to understand. \n\nHow can the narcissist be so cruel in the end? I loved the narc. Did everything! Gave my life, my best effort, my best pelvis motion! Every drop of me! \n\nAnswer: the narcissist has to in order to make themselves feel better about the envy they have for you. It’s like a toxin in your body but you have no liver or kidneys. Emotionally, whatever bad emotions the narcissist has park in their emotional landscape until they can transfer them to someone else. All narcissists are required to have an external emotional regulator or they will start to rapidly decline in mental health. \n\nThat’s why the narcissist cannot be alone. \n\nDuring the discard, if you do not talk to the narcissist or stop supplying the narcissist, you will meet their rage. The narcissist will try everything to destroy you. It’s like each envious thought brings them shame. That shame stacks up inside them. You don’t talk to them so the bricks stack up. They get heavier and heavier. \n\nSomebody is getting these heavy ass bricks because the narcissist is not a mason! \n\nThe narcissist is going to crash all of their negative emotions onto you. \n\nThe envy is shameful. These are emotions the narcissist will escape by crushing you, smearing you, and telling everyone around them you did nothing. It’s a way the narcissist deludes themselves and the new supply as well as you into believing there is some prize in the narcissist. \n\nAs the narcissist ages, turns 35, 45, even their enablers don’t believe them anymore. “You’re in love again? Yeah, yeah, yeah.”\n\n“Your ex tore up your house and defaced your car? Ain’t that like the 7th time this happened to you? Hmm…”\n\nMy X pwNPD used to tell me “everyone used to want me so bad that they would fight me. Their girls wanted me so they would try to hurt me.”\n\nWhen I think about that BS statement now, I just roll my eyes. 😂\n\nThe narcissist deludes themselves *even through skepticism!* And by letting all the bricks of envy and shame fall down on you, you give them the emotional freedom for their new delusional landscape. \n\nThat’s why you have to go no contact ASAP. Take that from the narcissist. Make the narcissist carry its own bricks and dump them on the new supply.\n\nWhen you understand who the narcissist is, you’ll see that the creature is small, pathetic; an envious loser with no identity. The narcissist is dedicated to chasing a fleeting emotion that lasts a few months, and then pretending before the world they aren’t miserable spending a bunch of time, years even, with someone they hate. \n\nThat’s no exaggeration. \n\nDuring devaluation, they are constantly searching for a new supply. If they don’t have a new one, they will recycle the old. Plotting and scheming on how they’re going to get out of the relationship and also maintain their image that is so critical to their delulu world. \n\nThe narcissist “loves” you because you’re incredible and beautiful.\n\nThe narcissist “hates” you because you stopped supplying them. \n\nThe narcissism causes the narcissist to superimpose “love” and “hate” \n\nOn top of the envy it refuses to acknowledge.

I told my lawyer today that he is scaring me because the last time I saw him was at the park with our baby and he threw things, yelled, followed me around, and sat in the car trunk while I tried to close it and I was trying to leave. However, it’s always a fine line where I feel afraid of him but he has never hit me or anything. He advised me to file a restraining order (also calls and texts nonstop when I ask him to stop and only talk about the baby’s needs) I agree with him that emotional abuse and being afraid is a reason to get a restraining order. But I’m terrified and feel guilty, I am afraid of his reaction to a restraining order and family/friends asking about it and I can only explain emotional bad treatment. I feel confused and want some honest input. Thanks ",

And I'm expected to sit here, and say \"well, narcissism doesn't automatically correlate to being an abuser.\" Yeah. That's a given. The mere fact you think it's necessary to say that is just a sign of the deeper societal issues where victims are never valued as much as the perpetrators. What is never fully acknowledged is the sheer extent of the harm they have caused me and countless other people. Every single person who abused me was narcissistic. Every single one. But I'm expected to sit here and say, \"oh, well, narcissistic abuse is such an ableist term. I would never say such a thing.\"\n\nNarcissistic abuse is real. I am so sickened by the number of people online who continually dismiss it as ableist.\n\nEmotional abuse will never suffice to describe the trauma caused by narcissistic abuse. As Dr. Ramani and many other psychologists have stated, narcissistic abuse is something that occurs when someone is socially domineering, entitled, grandiose, low empathy, and oftentimes someone who is capable of putting up an image of \"being a pillar of their community\" or an otherwise good person.\n\nThis isn't to say that emotional or verbal abuse isn't \"as bad.\" All abuse is bad. But narcissistic abuse deserves a distinction, and narcissistic people are actively fighting against that. Part of that is just the nature of narcissism. They want to believe themselves to be the innocent victim. They struggle with low empathy and being domineering. Even if they have no control of their behavior, it doesn't matter. It is still a unique phenomenon that occurs due to their specific disorder. There's nothing ableist about it. That's literally just how naming and language works.\n\nI have no problem with narcissistic people who are seeking therapy and working on themselves. I support them. But I cannot support the continued dismissal of victims of narcissistic abuse. \n\nVictims should always take priority when it comes to describing abuse. Not the literal fucking abuser in question. As someone who struggles with mental health I wouldn't give a fuck if the disorder I had led to \"such and such disorder abuse.\" Because I actually fucking think that would make me more mindful of my behaviors. It would give me a greater sense of responsibility and accountability towards others. But guess what? The fact that I can say that *is the reason why narcissistic abuse is different.* Because narcissitic abusers are literally so incapable of taking any form of accountability they shirk responsibity any way they can. \n\nWhat I would compare this to historically is just about every social rights movement ever. \n\nThe fact is that victims are expected to take on a continually dehumanized role in society. Even if laws change, they are still expected to submit and accept disrespect and dehumanization. You see it in the way the queer community is treated. In how women and minorities are treated. \n\n\"Boys will be boys.\" \"Girls have to cover up, or else it's their fault if they get assaulted!\" We don't talk about how people in reservations are forced to pay ridiculous amounts for the same shit we buy every day. We ignore the many queer people who have been violently victimized and instead call them groomers, predators. These same patterns occur in different ways in all marginalized communities. \n\nI get it. It's not fun acknowledging when you've hurt someone. But guess what's less fun? Never truly hearing the words \"I'm sorry. I was the one who was wrong.\" ",

I used the money I earned babysitting to purchase locks for my bedroom and attic access doors so he couldn't get to me in my sleep.\n\nI didn't get relief until I went away to college and never looked back.  My brother became an ordained minister, and I thought he had changed.  I didn't see much of him or his family and felt safe until one of his sons was sentenced to 40 years in prison for child molestation.  That is when he began telling family and friends I am mentally ill, a liar, and can't be trusted.  People started calling me to let me know what was going on.  He can't attack me physically anymore, so he has tried to skew others' perceptions of me and ruin my reputation.  One of my cousins found a video of him testifying in his church that God had delivered him from a 30-year porn and sex addiction, and things started to make sense.  Pedophiles are not created in a vacuum, and my brother doesn't want anyone else making that connection which leads directly back to him.",

        "Title": "I think I dated a narcissist (?)",
        "Upvotes": 5,
        "Text": "Okay so title basically says what it means, I think my latest ex partner may have been a narcissist the whole time, but I’m unsure. I don’t want to be one of those people who labels their ex partner’s as “crazy” or “narcissistic” because under no means am I perfect, I’ve done some terrible things myself and had worked to take accountability through them within my soul and with therapy, I still even sit here believing maybe I was the narcissistic one in reality, but after the latest development that happened between us (just this week, I’m unsure if we’re fully broken up but I fled the city to stay with family) I’ve been questioning what is wrong with them, thinking there must be something entirely different going on to make them act the way they do/have been acting, below is a list of some things that happened for the past remaining months of our relationship and how they began to make me question not only my self worth/but their mental well being. \n\n1. During our separation, I have spent the whole time physically/mentally working on myself. I went off to therapy, started actively working to try to understand me and my partner and to understand what I have done wrong within the relationship and what I can do to fix things/fix any behaviors that were not appropriate. I spent basically a whole solid month, I did not lie about any of my behaviors nor did I hide the truth from anyone, I admitted the wrong I did. I am not a perfect victim and I never will be, I did things, I was hurtful also and it doesn’t matter if it was a “reaction” or anything of the sorts, I still did it and I had to take accountability so I did. However my partner, for a whole solid month they spent it despising me and hyperfixating on every single thing I did wrong within the relationship, they had admitted to me after a solid month they realized *maybe* they had something to be a problem, and when they did finally apologize it was barely an apology, more so: “hey I just wanted to apologize for everything I did these past few months, I hope I have it in me to forgive myself and I want you to know that you deserve so much more then I gave you.” But whenever I specifically wanted to know what they were sorry about (any of their behaviors, or actions, anything other then a general cookie cutter apology since it was so out of nowhere) they couldn’t tell me any direct thing that they believed they were in the wrong for, I accepted the apology because I thought it was a start into the right direction but now I’m completely unsure. \n\n2. Slandering me, refusing to explain anything they did wrong (refusing to take accountability) and only saying what I did wrong. This shouldn’t bother me as much as it does, but for a solid month this partner has done nothing but call me a monster; blame all of their bad behaviors and actions off of me; and attempt to make it seem like I was quite possibly the worse person alive entirely. I deserved some of it I will admit, and I understood that. But after awhile it became apparent not once had they admitted/spoke to anyone (themselves, friends, me) about what they did wrong, and I tried to be understanding towards that. No one likes to be told their wrong, or told they messed up, but looking at my past interactions I directly told everyone what I did, the mistakes I made, because I needed to be transparent. I felt like utter shit for what I did and I wanted to resolve it as best as I could, the actions I did weren’t okay even if it was reactionary; or because I “snapped” they never should have happened and not once did I try to make it seem like I wanted that to happen, but with them all their bad behaviors and everything that happened just seemingly didn’t exist in their eyes, they were perfect, I was the one entirely in the wrong. It was painful especially since I had to go through intensive therapy to even begin to comprehend what I was being put through; and even while in therapy I still had to physically write out everything they inflicted upon me for me to snap out of it and realize I was hurt so many times, I just simply either couldn’t express that hurt without fear of a fight, being called over dramatic or told to get over it, or for them to promise to change and then break that promise barely 2 weeks later, I still sometimes feel as if I’m being overly sensitive with what happened and I should just get over it. \n\n3. Getting angry when I do not feel safe to be around them/speak to them as I once did. Something that was really big for me during this moment was that I genuinely felt as if I couldn’t talk to them normally as I once did because of all that they did/said to me near the end. I will admit, I walked on eggshells, I would constantly ask “is this okay if I do that?” Or “is this good with you?” Or “is this what you want??”, there were many times I would send them a long text message apologizing for feeling scared because THEY DIDNT MAKE ME FEEL SAFE. They did not cultivate any of the things I needed to feel safe, but the moment they expressed they needed I did everything in my power to follow it, and even then I wasn’t perfect, but I still did what they needed. But not once couldn’t they be bothered to do anything I needed to establish a safe space within our relationship once again, and they always had an excuse as to why so when I suddenly stopped asking, begging, it began to bother them when I hung out or reached out to other people and focus my own time and energy on myself and that made them upset, and I just don’t understand, why? I was doing what they wanted, I stopped begging for breadcrumbs or just even a confirmation because I couldn’t do it any longer, so why was I suddenly the bad one? Why did I have to apologize for feeling scared of them when not once have they did anything to make me feel safe, why is it bad I made them feel like a villain for reacting to behavior they were consistently doing? I don’t understand it!\n\n4. So this is something I want to try to express but I’m not exactly sure how to put into words, basically the biggest thing I was trying to express is that we both hurt each other. Plain and simple, they’re not the victim and neither am I, I even expressed that I am not the entire victim and I didn’t want to be treated like one. I even told them, I don’t want forgiveness nor do I want to know they “got over” what I did, all I wanted was an understanding between the both of us that we understood it. An understanding that we can hurt one another, that all it mattered was how we fixed or attempted to fix it, but even then it was like they physically couldn’t comprehend or understand that they did anything wrong to me. Any chance of attempting to express or explain things they did wrong I was either labeled “overdramatic”, “manipulative” or in many cases, flat out ignored unless they needed something from me and it would never be brought up again. Any bad behavior they did was simply to be forgotten, and never be brought up, but the bad behavior or things I did would continually be held above my head or brought up at any time it became convenient for them.\n\n5. Only reaching out to me whenever they needed something or whenever it became convenient for them. So during this physical separation I tried to reach out to check in whenever I could, I’ll admit I became overbearing after awhile and let up once I saw my messages were begging ignored for days on end. But I always checked in; or at least tried to, but they’d either say nothing about the situations they were going through, drop it all on me out of nowhere (I wish I was kidding they would drop all this and just me in a single day because as they put into words “since I GUESS you wanna know.” And would get upset when I was unsure how to react to all that suddenly and so forth. Whenever they had an issue outside of what was going I wanted to offer help if I could; it got to the point I could no longer overexert myself for them so I stopped begging for constant words of what they wanted/needed/were thinking or feeling. They only would message me whenever they needed something, most of the time it was money, momentary questions of things they couldn’t be bothered to remember, or when it came to benefits that would impact them directly. For example, our food stamps, they would reach out because they were close to being cancelled so I would have to get them fixed before they could, the car and claiming it as for gas or things like that, saying it was for food and that they weren’t eating properly. But every time I sent this money, I noticed they would consistently go and get more weed or go out, and it would be a continuous cycle. Even when I would attempt to borrow money (since they stopped giving me rides due to issues with the car/their own personal needs which I agreed with) most of the time it was for Lyft to and from work, but they couldn’t even be bothered to let me borrow the full amount demanding I needed to go half/pay the majority since “I don’t have it to spare.” Or some other form of an excuse, which I couldn’t understand. All they had to pay for bill wise was their PlayStation loan payment; their car insurance, and food; I took on our rent, remaining bills; and the gas for the car I wasn’t even driving \n\n6. They were severely insecure within our relationship (and within themselves. Very insecure I had to compliment them all the time and check in because depending on their mood towards themselves they could shutdown or be so much more concerning.) and relied on me for assurance/to constantly overlook any problem they did/to constantly be the confident one within our relationship while in public they acted incredibly charismatic and secure to other people, but with me they were constantly saying “I’m not good enough for you.” “I’m going to ruin this relationship.” “I’m a bad person.” “You shouldn’t be with me.” “I don’t deserve you.” “You should hate me.” And their mood was constantly depending on how much praise I give them or how many times I say “oh no you’re not a bad person you’re not going to ruin things, you shouldn’t feel that way.” And if I came for the same reassurance, or if I needed any sort of assurance for anything I was told that “if I say something I mean it. I shouldn’t have to constantly repeat myself.” Or in many cases I was told I was asking for far too much and expecting too much from them, it was an unequal balance to the point I completely stopped asking for reassurance at some point and would just shut down whenever I felt any sort of negative emotions; and even then that wasn’t the correct thing to do. If a bad situation happened (many times we would end up in a financially unstable position due to their inability to save money properly or from their spending habits which I would have to overwork myself to fix, borrow money from others and end up in all sorts of debt; and then forgive always:) I was expected to fix it alongside having to coddle them and go “it’s okay it was a mistake we’re fixing it.” But under no circumstances were they fixing it, it was something that always happened. A consistent cycle I couldn’t break out of no matter what I tried to do, and if I didn’t emphasize or have the energy to be optimistic, I was the one suddenly with the issue. And let’s not begin with their projection problems, with no difficulty they would say “you wanted me to be perfect, you expected so much from me.” When all I wanted from them was to properly take care of themself and think of things *rationally* instead of putting us in bad situations; all I wanted was them to be smart, so we couldn’t end in these situations, and never once have I expected perfection or anything like that from them. \n\n7. Onto the projection issues, once again they would project every single problem, onto me. Their health declining? Oh that was my fault because I pushed them so hard (they have a chronic illness. Multiple. Every time i would be the one to take care of them when their body shut down, or when they would hurt themselves once again, it was me, and all I would ask is for them to please for the love of god stop hurting themselves and their body and just do better for themselves.) their inability to communicate? Oh that was my fault because I didn’t bother to understand them (for months, years even I would break down into tears begging for the slightest form of communication from them. Whenever issues happened I wanted to take care of them, even if it took me a few days to talk about I wanted to work on them, they would constantly shut down and never speak to me, or would get angry and get in my face if I’d start crying because of feeling overwhelmed and lost.) during this moment they would say “(friend they are staying with) understands me. They don’t push me. They don’t make me feel bad for feeling a certain way.” And would then say “it’s not comparison I’m trying to explain why I talk to them more then you.”, this was a continuous process where I ended up breaking down asking why their friend got better treatment then me, their partner, and they just shrugged and couldn’t explain it to me, it was so fucking damaging I felt like I just wasn’t enough to be changed and deserving of that action. I was told it was because they understood each other and did things the same way, and I was too “much”, and when I stopped doing “much” it was still not enough, I was still the one in the wrong for not talking about things, it was always a lose lose situation. They even blamed me for actions I specifically asked them NOT TO DO. Like for example, my job required me to work sporadic hours primarily at night plus from the abuse and overall depression I was experiencing due to how my life was going I would sleep in until 4-6pm, which I took accountability for. I should have expressed that more clearly, or explained what was wrong with me in that moment and I didn’t until the end, because I didn’t think it was a problem, but they would say I would make them stay up late every night despite the fact it made them sick or I’d “get angry with them and shut down.” The only time I did this, was when they would ignore me the moment they got home and rather focused on their phone talking to the same friend as above, only acknowledging me if I was doing something for them, either sexually or physically. I’d get angry because no matter what I did, they just wouldn’t spend time with me no matter what I did, and only would pay attention if I had something to offer. And even when they would try to force themselves awake for long periods I would have to beg and express them to sleep, on many nights I would have to pretend to be asleep so they’d sleep first and then I’d get back up to find solace the only time I could, night time. \n\n8. The sexual issues was the biggest thing. Sometime this year a repressed memory of sa I experienced as a child resurfaced, and it caused me a lot of pain especially mentally. I wasn’t capable of continuing to have sex regularly because I wasn’t comfortable for weeks and still am not,  if it was constantly an ever going issue. And not even just that, I worked long hours where I was physically exhausted, many days I just didn’t have the energy to have sex. This became a huge issue between us often where I was told I was being a “tease” and never letting them do as they wanted, I would constantly be harassed night after night for head and told and whined to “you told me you’d do it 3 weeks ago!” “I did that for you awhile ago!” “Well do it again!” And if I expressed any sort of concern, of me being tired, they’d get angry and ice me out for days on end, to the point where I just gave up and started doing whatever they wanted from me sexually if it meant they wouldn’t ice me out, if I was useful for them then it was fine it didn’t matter if I was tired. All I wanted was for them to be happy with me so I let anything happen, because I didn’t want to fight. God I was so fucking tired of fighting, of them screaming at me. At the physical threats, at the looks of pure anger and disgust they’d send me because I’d say no, I just wanted them to like me, I just wanted them to love me so I’d do anything. I’d still do anything, I shouldn’t do anything but I wanted to do anything\n\n\n9. Acts of violence and refusal of change, this one was actually one of the more newer things I noticed but for about 5 months they have became increasingly violent. If we’d get an argument or a heated discussion in the car, they’d drive 100 miles over the speed limit to intimidate me and leave me begging them to slow down, to make me stop talking about the situation or doing anything about it. If I was to burst into tears due to their tone/what they said to me, I was overly sensitive, I needed to get over myself because “this is who I am and if you don’t like it then I don’t know what the fuck to tell you.” They’d punch things when they’d become frustrated, the car, the steering wheel, the wall, I would have to beg them to stop doing that because it terrified me due to past abuse I witnessed. All of these cultivating to a pinnacle where one night, all of these actions and so much more just all appeared and in this final fucking fight I ended up physically slapping them. I know it was wrong, I regretted it the moment I did it but I was physically fucking terrified of what’d they do, how they’d react, and their behavior. They looked at me like I was below dirt, no better then a monster in their eyes because I was sobbing trying to understand, begging to know why’d they do the things they did to me, I just needed to know why. Why did they hate me? Why’d they do this to me of all people after all we’ve been through? And after that night, they’ve been hyper fixated on the single slap. I’m the monster, I’m the abuser, it’s been held over my head since then and not once had I asked them not to hate me for it, for them to forgive me. Because what I did wasn’t okay, but that’s all they could focus on against me, all of it. Not what they did, not what made me react that way, I was the “crazy abuser girlfriend” and that’s what they told their friend, they never told their friend the full truth and extent of what happened. I was the one who messed up, the slap was everything of me, and I couldn’t change that, I didn’t even try to I understood their anger, but no matter what I tried to forgive them for what they did. But because they never physically did anything to me (besides the constant physical threats and so on) it immediately made me the worse between the both of us, and I still struggle, it hurts. It genuinely does, because I fucking can’t excuse what I did nor did I wanted to. All I wanted was a why, and even my therapist told me that this is common with people in my situation, but is that all I’ll ever be now?\n\n10. As mentioned before, they continually kept the true extent of their actions hidden to the point I genuinely believe this once “mutual” friend of ours now believes I’m an emotionally manipulative abuser who for months made them question their self worth and existence, as if they had to say my ex from me, but under no circumstances did I ever, ever want that. I never wanted to do what I did, I hate myself for what I did, but do they know that? No. All they know is how I reacted, how I slapped them, how I went off the walls insane finally blowing up about all the continuous hurt/behavior and lack of change I experienced for YEARS. I was the manipulator. I was the monster, they never did anything to me and I was entirely at fault, that’s what the story became, and it fucking broke me. This Tuesday I saw their friend for the first time in possibly a month, and he stared at me from the steps with disgust across his eyes as if I was trying to hurt my ex, even though I was actively pressed into the wall of my apartments hallway just begging to understand why they were ignoring me, and when their friend yelled and slammed the door I was a terrified of them coming down and hurting me. I was terrified of both of them, I didn’t even have my hands out to defend me so I wouldn’t scare or trigger my ex. I crossed them behind me to make it known to everyone all I wanted was to know why, and when their friend looked at me like a monster and stared down at me, I couldn’t even say anything or react. I just knew then that they never said a word about what they did to me, that I was the crazy one in the story, that I was the villain. When they both left, I immediately ran into my apartment and broke into tears before calling someone to leave, I didn’t feel physically safe because of both of them once again, the only difference was I didn’t fight this time. I fled. \n\nThere’s a lot more that happened that made me question if they were narcissist or not, but I don’t want to push any further. Talking about all of this genuinely pains and exhausts me, but I need to know some actual options of those who been through similar situations to this or understands what am I going through. \n\nAm I the crazy one in this? Is this something I actually might be right about? I don’t know, all I know is that this situation mentally destroyed me and I don’t feel as if there’s any coming back from it, I’m so fucking terrified that possibly I was the issue all along and I was too dense to see it, but I tried I tried so hard. Please just any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Text": "Hi everybody! I have been looking at posts on narcs and narc abuse on here and if has really helped me out a lot. I am currently struggling with my situation and need some advice/support.\n\nI met a narc last year, everything seemed to good to be true. Love bombing, always texting calling and taking me on dates. Everything changed when someone warned me about him out in public in front of him and who he is. This caused a conflict with us and the love bombing seized.\n\nhe would tell me that everything is okay and i can come over and talk. He would set a time limit on me and kick me out after that.\n\nhe would then text me like everything was fine and we hung out again and after that he completely ghosted me for one week. He came back and texted me a week later laughing about the ghosting and acting like nothing had happened.\n\nhe continued to text me ( not like in the beginning) make plans with me, then on the day of the plans he would just ghost me. One day he would act interested the next silence.\n\ni contacted him a month later and he acted like nothing happened. He was on a vacation and sent me a picture of another woman ( someone he allegedly met on the trip) to strike a reaction but i never gave him one. After the trip he came to my place and was extremely rude, accusing me of going on dates with a bunch of men. The next day he accused me of being an alcoholic and that he wanted nothing to do with me but said well maybe we can be \"friends\" then ghosted me\n\ni assumed at this point it was over and i would never hear from him again. He contacted me on the holiday a month later acting like everything was great. We ended up hanging out a month or so later and when we hung out it went well, i thought things were going in the right direction.\n\nafter we hung out.. silence. I would try to text him and if he replied it would be very short then he just stopped replying. He ghosted me for almost three months. I thought he was done this time and of course he popped up again like nothing happened. At this point i was getting sick of if so i questioned him as to why he dissapeared and always does this. Of course he had some sob story about a injury and family member dying of cancer. I felt pity for him and he gave me an apology.. so i took him back stupidly.\n\nthings seemed to be going smooth for a couple months, of course until his family member died and his injury got better he never contacted me and was distant. Menawhile, i was there for him during the difficult time for him. He lied to me about the funeral and never wanted to chat. I was chasing him and he would always claim nothing was wrong but when i said i thought he used me when he was down he could not handle it and would always tell me he didnt care and to go away. I would get so upset i would try texting him to work it out he would barelt respond and if he did he would not be nice about it.\n\nwe did hang out a couple times after that, he would ignore me after. One day i was like hey i think you are seeing someone else, and i was like well ixam seeing someone so no problem if you are he said \" buy bye good luck with your new guy stop contacting me\" i was devastated and tried to get into contact with him for weeks then i just gave up and accepted it was over. He ended up contacting me a month later acting like everything was fine. He wanted to go out and have drinks i told him i would. He and i both seemed to have a great time. He ends up ignoring me again. I kept texting him trying to figure out what was wrong. He kept saying everything was fine and i said ok can we hang out again? He said maybe i was like why? He just kept saying maybe …\n\nour last conversation we had… i said what is wrong ? He said nothing is wrong everything is fine. I asked him why he keeps saying maybe. He said \" maybe but i dont want to see you right now\" i said why? He saix \" im just not feeling it, if i wanted to date i would\" i said why did you contact me less then a week ago wanting to go out? He said i didnt.. even though he did. So i said should i just move on or what? He said whatever you want to do. So i said that he was really confusing me and asked him if he had anything more to say before i move on? My messages were turning green so i panicked he blocked me and reacted irrationally. I said \" omg did you block me? My messages are not going through. Even texted him on my work phone asking what was up. And called him twice ( please dont judge me i know it is pathetic i never was this type of girl before him) so he replied and said \" Ok I'll block you now\" then immedietly blocked me. He has never blocked me before since I have met him he will just ghost. Is this ths final discard aka \" grand finale? Did i just push him too far?\n\nthis has upset me so much its hard to even function.",

The safety plan was he was to do all the rehabilitation courses,programs and also go to therapy and do weekly drug tests and if he wa s to relapse he wasn’t aloud to stay in my home with our toddler for 5 days or till he’s completely come down \nHe obviously didn’t take those rules serious and he hardly put in the work to stay together as a family a healthy one \nWhen his drug test came back pos and they were going to come round that afternoon to move him along he chucked a tantrum and punched the ground , punched concrete as hard as he could and fully broke his hand and had to have surgery , just set back after set back with this man child😅\nHe ended up staying in hospital for a night or 2 anyways \nAnd boy didn’t that get his paranoia up, he discharged himself from the hospital because he was to worried about what I was up to\nI was quit e upset with him and just his lack of him even being able to grasp the depth of how serious this is or him just not giving a farkkk ,he’s so used to getting his own way with no real boundary or consequence like ever \nSo I didn’t want to pick him up from the hospital because he had discharged himself he had money for a taxi, I was hanging with one of my girl friends like my only one now since being isolated with him again , that I don’t get to see that much and when I do its such a big drama 😭 I’m not aloud to have any guy friends because I’m gonna fuck them apparently and I’m not aloud any girl friends either because I’m gonna fuck them too😮‍💨😭😅\nIt was horrible yet here he is leaving taking my car escaping when ever he\ngets a chance and is itching to get on and turn into a raging sex pest \nAny girl that’s willing to give it up and give him some validation and boost his ego up abit is a fuckin 10 in his eyes😍🤮🫠\nI’ve never once cheated on him while being with him yes when we would break up I’d eventually get back out there but he would do this to me our whole relationship and which is why I’m so fucked up he was so suss on me this whole stint we had this year that just ended \nLike he seriously would do laps around the house lurking through all the windows just watching me making sure I don’t bring a man in even though I got my baby strapped to my hip still pretty much plus I live in a little 2 bedroom flat as if imma bout to sneak dudes in with my baby in my room and my baby daddy in the next that I would be way to petrified to cheat on lead alone in the same house with him there😭😅\nMy neighbour has had to speak to me and call the cops because he was climbing ontop of the roof scoping the house and next doors yard probably to make sure I’m not making fellas jump the back fence for me😅\nHe would also be in the man hole that also connected into my old lady neighbours ceiling and he would be up there galloping around checking the coast is clear at bloody 2am \n, I think that I’m probably going to go celibate now to be honest , I’m that turned off from being made to feel like a dirty cum bucket when the only pee pee I was riding was his 🤯 he was that onto me constantly that even if I was cheating he’d bloody have some evidence 🤦‍♀️ when ever he would have a suspicion or get paranoid he’d take me to my room and pull my pants and undies off and make me spread em so he could do a fucking observation on me to make sure it all looked the same down and in there \nHonestly I would feel so violated and get so angry and upset every time like who tf does that\nBeing on guard constantly pleading my freakin innocence everyday trying to show whatever receipts I could to put his mind at ease yet he actually did cheat on me physically and emotionally this stint and where’s my reassurance and validation…ever??? Still waiting 😭I been sleeping with one of eye open,keeping my guard up and trying to just turn my emotion off and just be civil and survive whilst trying to not make Brandon’s behaviour stand out too much to our daughter , it was still chaos at time and she knows when he would be mean 😪 she didn’t need that unnecessary chaos our life was peaceful and calm and on track before he came in like a fuckin tornado and rocked our world for abit Nearly 2 weeks ago I made a run for it with my baby just wearing what we had on\nHe tried to barricade the driveway and he tried to snap my car keys but then he funnily enough called my mum thinking that I was being dramatic and she needed to come and talk some sense into me but the moment I yelled out he’s not letting me leave and he’s trying to break my keys she knew that it was on so I quickly grab my keys and speed off to my family home and I didn’t leave , there was no way I was going back into my home that is mine with only my name that I had to work hard for because I knew something bad was going to happen \nHe comes to my parents house the next evening and by that point I’d already put a complaint in with the police advised by Css and they said that if he rocks up and is disorderly call police so that’s what my mum did , he was yelling and carrying on that he’s gunna unalive himself  if I don’t come home to him or he’s going to expose me with all of these hundreds of videos he’s secretly got of me.\nAnd he did slander me on social media and what he said was bloody brutal too😮‍💨 but I’d rather let him have his smear campaign if it means I get to heal in peace with my daughter away from him\n\nThe police came and whacked a dvo on for my little girl and I , he was meant to move along to back to where he came from and he had every opportunity too I even sent him money for fuel because that was his excuse so I left him with no excuses and he still didn’t leave 🤡\nHe’s broken into my house busted both of the front doors and I had a bloody house inspection that following week too My parents did a drive by on my house a day or 2 after the dvo was put on and they found him tweakin and half asleep on the couch\n\nprotection order and found disorderly with a weapon a hunting knife \nHe’s been taken straight into remand and off to prison for a little period of time which would’ve most likely done nothing but fuel more hatred towards me which is what I’m going to be scared of when he gets out in a month and a half \nHis car and all his belongings are still out the front of my house , I’m sick of seeing it but I don’t know what to do with it I don’t want him anywhere near us 😖\n\nHow do I stay strong , he seems to snag me when I have my vulnerable moments every so often  but those feelings are worth feelimg wayyyyy more than how my daughter and I are left to feel when he comes into our life \nI can’t put my little girl through that ever again she would’ve felt all that I did and I’m not about to pass on my trauma 😭\nI hate him and I really hope people start to see his true colours surely by now people and his family would have to clue on that he’s never going to do or be the man he reckons and he’s never going to stop lying and having a god complex and that sorta energy makes me want to vom🤮\n\nSorry guys that wasn’t a summary that was a novel lol ty for the trauma dump ",

        "Text": "Hi, I made a very poor decision in getting involved with someone who lives near me and is very clearly a narc, if not a psychopath. I've actually lived by him for years with no issues, it wasn't until I became obviously single (hint: stalking me) that he decided to try to enter my life and I should have seen the red flags, but sadly was in a vulnerable state. And yes, I know getting involved with someone who lives near me was dumb but I didn't ask for it. I just didn't set better boundaries, lesson learned\n\nHe started following me to the beach everyday, where I go each evening to walk my dog.  At first it creeped me out but he upped the charm and after 3 months of dedicated stalking (not lying, he was there everyday for 3 months it eventually turned into romantic sunsets with music listening and talking etc) he was able to flip a switch and I started to trust him and actually like his attention. This quickly lead to things getting physical, but I did have really firm boundaries and we were tested together before anything entered into physical.\n\nFast forward 7 months later and I'm in discard phase, after what has been some really horrible abuse. As he lives across from me, our relationship slowly went from friendship to something purely sexual - def emotionally abusive in that regard - where he started spending less and less time with me, to completely ignoring me altogether, unless it was a booty call. He has a porch in front of my home and I would receive texts at all hours of the night, whether it is watching me, or saying I see you can't sleep, come over... etc. I have former sexual trauma, raped, so saying no is difficult and sexual relationships are challenging for me.\n\nI ended things, despite having feelings for him, because I know he is not who he says he is. I left for 3 weeks to my home country and blocked him. His behavior became erratic and it became clear he was juggling multiple women. I am still extremely attached to him, even though mentally I know he is NO good, just a POS, but the attachment living in close vicinity has made it impossible for me to fully cut the cord. When I returned I made the mistake of allowing him back in my life and apologizing - withdrawals, obviously.\n\nA few nights ago, he decided to bring another girl home right in front of my face, even after reconciling, doing sexual things so I could see, etc. It made me hit my breaking point, and I snapped. He of course wanted this. I had a full on mental breakdown just sort of the explosion of everything I've suppressed from his lies, violating me and discarding me. This involved me confronting him for trying to humiliate me as I just wasn't in a strong enough place to ignore which lead to him screaming I'm crazy, etc. I've since left my home, I have a place through Saturday. I have a security camera on my house and am able to go get my things as needed when he is not there. I do not want to see him, or have any contact with him, or let him ever see me.\n\nI am considering leaving town for a few weeks to get in a stronger place although I really don't want to, I'm not sure what else to do. I do have a second home I can go to, shared with friends, and stay for as long as I need. I work remote so its easy enough to get away, I just don't really want to leave my home. I fear his abuse will continue however and while I hate him now, bringing girls around me and rubbing things in my face is affecting my mental health tremendously.\n\nWould you all get the hell out and stay away? Or do I just suck it up and be stronger and stand my ground in my home? I'm not sure what is better. I know he is abusing me because he just decided to do it the exact night I tried to make amends with him and instead of having privacy he wanted to rub it in my face. I just don't know how much more I can take, and I feel like I can't sleep at night in my own home right now.",

        "Text": "I unfortunately fell hard for a man’s lovebombing, and I feel it has ruined my life forever.\n\nMy abuser seemed so sweet and innocent. I couldn’t imagine him being the man I discovered him to be. A girl tried to warn me how he discarded her when he talked to me, but he really made me believe what we had was something different. I trusted him completely.\n\nI broke up with him 5 weeks ago during a devaluation phase because it was impacting my work performance. I know he wanted me to break it off with him so he could look innocent. He took the break up well and wanted to remain friends. After the break up, I had reached back out to the girl that warned me. I uncovered so many lies. In hindsight, I could see all the manipulation tactics from day one. I also reached out to get some previous ex’s stories because his behavior change seemed so unreal. It was more stories of lies, manipulation, and cheating. I could go on hours about the stories. (I suspect he had ASPD as well.)\n\nTwo weeks ago, I had finally gotten the strength to block him. It was hard but I did it. \n\nI had remembered a story he had given me at the beginning of us talking: that he has a rare form of psoriasis that appears on his genitals. I asked the other girl if she got this same story. She said yes. But still the details of the story didn’t match. I felt sick to my stomach. This man lied so much to me. Even about his mom having cancer. So I book an appointment to get tested. \n\nFive days ago, I got the results back. Sure enough I was positive. And it’s not a curable one. I unblock him and send the cliche “we need to talk” text. We have a video call. He gets quiet and apologizes to me, but then the subject changes and we just chat like normal. He didn’t even ask me what STD. It’s like he knew already. Later that night he asked if I wanted to come over. He made it sound like he wants to make it work with us now. I agreed to, as I felt alone in this diagnosis. He had no hesitation to try to sleep with me right away. I feel if he didn’t already know, he would have wanted to be more careful. I fully believe this man was knowingly spreading this disease.\n\nThen I spent another day and night at his house 3 days ago. It was like I could forget everything. It was just a familiar comfort. It just seemed nice between us again. But then that night I noticed a girl continuously calling him and texting him. It made me remember all the nights and days when I was dating him that he’d ignore me for hours. He tells me it’s a girl that he was talking to from a dating app, because he felt so lost after I blocked him. We got into an argument. I told him to tell her, or I would.\n\nThe next day, he still didn’t tell her. So I did. I told her the reason why he wasn’t replying and to let her know to get tested. I sent proof I was there. The ex was pissed about this of course.\n\nBut last night he did say he’s going to keep his promise and that we will get through this together. But I don’t even know what that means. He’s back to ignoring my texts still. \n\nLogically, I can see this is just a trauma bond. Logically, I can see that he really a terrible person with no regard to how he hurts others. I can see that I’m just terrified of being alone because of the diagnosis. But I’m still struggling to break free. I still just want nothing more than for him to hold me and tell me it’s ok. It’s still hard to believe someone could truly be that evil and heartless. I don’t think he even actually wants to make it work, but still using this as a way to control and keep me.\n\nThis is affecting my mental health and work performance. And I need to make a decision where to move in less than two weeks. I’m afraid to pull the trigger on the move because I’d be moving much further from my abuser. Which should be a good thing!!! But why am I still hesitating??\n\nI did so much work on codependency and PTSD in the last couple years, and I feel it’s gotten me nowhere now. (I grew up in an abusive household, and my mother still lives with her abuser. I also have other sexual traumas. Which I know probably takes a big part in this.)\n\n\nTLDR; My abuser knowingly gave me an incurable STD. I was already struggling with getting over the relationship and breaking the trauma bond. Now I feel hopeless. I’m still afraid to lose him and can’t let go, even though I know better logically. \n\nI needed to get this off my chest. Thank you anyone that read all of this!\n",

        "Text": "It’s been over 2 months since my(35f) narc ex(33m) broke up with me and I’m not really improving. Friends and family are even telling me so. My depression is the same or worse. I’m still ruminating over my ex constantly throughout the day. I believe he has fully moved on at this point but I am stuck. I’ve posted and deleted similar on other threads. Sometimes people have cruel things to say like “You need to just accept he’s not your boyfriend anymore” But it’s incredibly hard for me. I was extremely codependent with this person. He made it so that I was completely powerless and needing him for everything. He left me 2 weeks after I did something incredibly vulnerable for him…go to a sex club (he is a sex addict on top of all of this using me as a vessel for his addiction). We were together for almost 2 years. I don’t have much genuine support. I live in nyc and have one very close friend who I can depend on. But everyone else I know here is a bit transactional and untrustworthy. It doesn’t help that my therapist is constantly going on vacations leaving me weeks without being able to talk to her. Also doesn’t help that I have a part time job, only work 2 days a week and the rest of my days are spent making music (i’m a musician), walking outside or simply crying. If you feel inclined to offer advice I just ask that you please be kind. I am a highly\nsensitive person. I am aware that I am not doing that great of a job moving on. ",

        "Text": "Hey guys, I'm new here but I discovered this sub at a time when I was reeling from getting thrown out of the last 5-6 years of my life by my Narc. ex. I wanted to share my story if that's okay. I don't wanna just keep it all inside me. \n\nI was going through a tough time back in 2018 and I was trying to rekindle old connections. I started talking to a girl I had gone to high school with but hadn't known her very well at the time. Of course after a while of talking, this girl starts saying more and more vaguely sexual stuff to me, and me being a literal caveman/lonely, I of course started to take her up on her more 'physical' offers. After about a week or two of \"no strings attached\" she starts telling me that if I'm not going to date her, then we can't keep talking. Says she'll just disappear from my life if I don't make her my girlfriend. I was very willing to date her anyway, but this really caught me off guard, the whole no strings attached was her idea. I told her I'd be willing to date her. She told me she needed time to think about it. Talk about whiplash. She slept with another one of her male friends later that night. She told me a few days later that she would go out with me, and that was the beginning of our relationship. \n\nWe had now been dating for about 3 months or so when all of a sudden she wanted to move in with me. I was having trouble affording my living space due to rent raises, so I talked it out with her, it was kind of fast but she assured me that she would pay half the bills with me, and nothing from our dates previously suggested that she had an issue sharing costs, and she did have a job. So after a little deliberation I let her move in with me. (her apartment was pretty crap anyway, so I figured it would be nice for her to not have to live in a half finished studio that used to be a kitchen. )\n\nAbout 2 weeks after everything was moved in she lost her job for \"sexual harassment\". She told me she had made some stupid sex joke at work and been fired for that. I believed her at the time. Its around this time I started to notice stuff going randomly missing around the house. Cigarette packs, a few dollars here and there. Figured I had misplaced stuff. One day though I asked her just to see if she knew where they went, she said no, she hadn't touched anything. I find her about 20 minutes later hiding cigarettes in her filing cabinet, same brand I was smoking at the time (I have quit smoking since). I asked her \"oh hey where'd you find that pack?\", she says \"I found it on the counter yesterday, I think its mine.\" I tell her I had just asked her if she had seen any smokes on the counter, and she said no, and now she's trying to hide a pack of cigarettes. She admitted to taking them, offered no apology, and then said \"I'm gonna take like half of them for me though, hope that's ok\". This was the first time she lied to my face that I knew about, I tried to talk to her about it but she just eventually became unresponsive and tried to turn the argument on me for being \"financially abusive\" because she had just lost her job, and I still had mine. I was fine sharing but dang. She didn't even look for a job, for 4 years\n\nFast forward to my birthday later that year. I'm upstairs watching a movie in our room, and she tells me she's gonna go play some video games with one of our friends, and that she'll be at her computer if I need to find her. Her computer was at the bottom of the stairs, and the stairs funneled sound right up into our room. I suddenly hear her talking about sex, and making plans to go out and do some things with this dude using phrases like \"Yeah I have a boyfriend but like.. I'm bored, he doesn't have to know\". I paused my show for a bit and just sat and listened as she basically detailed out a whole plan to cheat on me, 2 days before my birthday. \n\nI kind of flipped my lid to be honest. I as calmly as I could manage, confronted her about this and told her I had heard everything that she had said to this man. She told me I was making shit up, that I didn't want her to have friends, that I was financially abusing her, that I was mistrusting, and that she wasn't even talking to that guy. She stormed out of the house and went to his house for the night, taking the money she had borrowed from her mom to pay for some food, to instead buy alcohol and bring it to his place. \n\nI texted her and said I couldn't do this, and that she'd have to find a new place to live. I felt like a total asshole pulling that card, and had never once threatened to throw her out, but this was a new low for her. She had told little lies and been insensitive quite a bit, but I was always able to overlook it, this time I tried to put my foot down.\n\nShe came back the next morning hungover, begging me not to throw her out, telling me she loved me, and telling me that it would never happen again. I let her stay.\n\n  \nOver the next 3 years, she started getting the idea that we were going to buy a house halfway across the country and move, since she didn't like the state we lived it. I told her pretty plainly that I was barely supporting us on my income, and that I didn't have the means to save for a house. This became a constant fight of her telling me at least once a week that I wasn't really contributing to the relationship at all, and that I wasn't contributing to a future. She would make ultimatums about us opening a bank account together, and applying for mortgages, but ultimately back down, as I kept telling her that I had almost no money, and without her working as well it just wasn't realistic. She continued to take my stuff, and insist that it had \"always been hers\"\n\nMany times I wanted to walk away, and leave, but I felt lonely, I felt like without her I wouldn't have anything, as for the most part I didn't really have any friends except for her anymore, it had been 3 years of isolation, and in the middle of covid, which made everything more isolated. I think at the time I kept telling myself that it was just covid lockdowns causing all my isolation but looking back on it now, I could have reached out, but I was in this constant cycle of trying my best to support my \"family\" and then getting yelled at when I didn't support hard enough (Because I made 13 dollars an hour). \n\nEventually things blew up. She had a crisis, told me she needed 200 dollars immediately, I asked what for, like even one WORD of what I was giving her 200 for, because trust at this point was pretty low. She screamed my head off and dumped me, told me I was once again \"financially abusing\" her. To be clear here, I kept her fed, housed, gave her a few spare bucks for smokes when I had it. I did everything I can and if I could afford something she had asked for, I did it most of the time. I used my discretion but I tried my best to support her needs. I didn't talk to her for 6 months after that, I moved out of the state, and I tried my best to put it all behind me. \n\nBut alas, I am rather emotionally dumb, and one night texted her. We started talking again, and for a while it reminded me why I had loved her in the first place. Underneath all of that self centered mess was a funny girl, who I thought cared about me. and she told me she had gotten a job and an apartment since we broke up. We got back together, this time a long distance thing, and things went well for a while, until the fights started happening, and she started telling me tons of stuff that wasn't true, or making up crazy stories about what she had done with her day and what she had planned, and acting on none of it. The fights about getting a house started again. By this point I had suffered a pretty bad injury to my foot on the job, and just couldn't manage trying to find a house together when I couldn't even walk, but we started to make more reasonable plans to start looking together, now that we were long distance, I was committed to trying to close that distance again. She visited me, I went back home and visited her, we kept talking about moving and trying to make plans and then one night, 2 months ago, texts me \"I think I don't wanna do this relationship anymore\". I tried to talk to her about it but she really wouldn't go into details about it. \n\nShe still kept calling me pet names, and kept talking to me every now and then about her day and what not, as if I was on retainer. I was really thinking of how I could show her that I want to make this work, and then I get two pieces of information from a mutual friend:\n\nPart 1: when she dumped me the first time, the money was for a hotel room. Or was going to be, she had plans to meet up with the guy who she had \"almost cheated\" on me with back all them years ago. \n\nPart 2: when she dumped me the second time its because she started sleeping with a guy who lived in her apartment building. She did this multiple times and never told me. \n\nI confronted her one last time. \"Why? Why did you lie to me? I would have accepted the truth always, and I would have been better off knowing what was going on, but you chose to cheat and then lie about it, and try to keep me on a leash incase you got bored\"\n\nShe (figuratively) detonated on me. She threw every single thing I had ever said back in my face, insulted me, went on a tirade that made almost no sense confirmed what I had been told by said mutual friend. I did NOT tell them I heard about this from someone else so she called me a stalker. I didn't want this someone else to catch heat because of our problems. \n\n  \nSo yeah.. That's me. There's probably more I'm leaving out, but that's what I can manage right now. It's been a month and a half since last contact, and she's blocked. I swear I'm not going back again because. while I can take getting hurt, and demeaned, I can't take the absolute shame and embarrassment of pretending that someone who lies and cheats on me is somehow up to my standards (Which are low, but dang). I was going to therapy before this, and still am, my therapist feels bad that she didn't do enough to try and make me see the red flags, but I don't blame her. I'm happy that she understands. I hope y'all understand too. Thanks for hearing me out. ",

        "Text": "I met someone and we hit it off immediately- both in our 30s. It was as if I knew this person my entire life. I looked forward to our conversations every day. We had what I thought was almost this cosmic connection that felt out of this world. It felt wonderful to meet a guy who paid close attention to me and wanted to talk to me every day. He and I shared so many similarities, we got along beautifully. He appeared to be so in tune with his emotions, speaking on them and telling me everything he felt. It felt good for someone to want me for once. It felt really good thinking someone felt the same intense crush for me that I felt for them. He told me with how drawn we were to each other, we must have be made for one another. I fell pretty hard.\n\nAfter some time, I realized he was abusing me via gaslighting, manipulation, jealousy, controlling behaviors, punishment/reward, passive aggressive tests/games, insults/accusations, love bombing, etc. I began to fear him, afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. Every time his tone shifted, I felt fear and I felt like I had to make him feel better/happy to make things normal again. I found myself almost addicted to him in the sense that if he ignored me or changed moods, I felt like I was withdrawing from a drug and that I needed his attention/approval. I found myself ignoring everyone else to make time for him, so that I could fully focus my time and attention onto him. If he felt I was not giving him my full attention 24/7, I would be punished with mood changes and dry replies or silence. He only acted like the person I met when I did what he wanted.\n\nThere were a lot of lies and inconsistencies about his personal life and himself that weren't adding up over time. I noticed flat out contradictions, but if I pointed any of them out, he would punish me with silence and accuse me of not trusting him. He would pout and treat me poorly for hours or days until I babied him enough. His behavior was changing drastically and he eventually wasn't the person I met. I tried having neutral conversations with him about some of the issues I was seeing, but it was like talking to a wall, going in circles for hours or days on end. I found myself exhausted and heart broken every day. He was wearing me down. He became FULLY codependent on me for his mood/emotional regulation, to the point of literal emotional/physical exhaustion on my end. I started to feel resentment towards him, finding myself extremely irritable and tired and short fused (which is unlike me). I found myself feeling quite literally mind fucked every day.\n\nEventually, it hit me I had to end things. I know narc abuse **only** gets worse and there's nothing you can do but walk away. I tried to distance myself slightly for a day to give myself a chance to think about everything, but it only caused him to rage/panic and flood me with angry messages. Upon seeing these messages, I ended things in a very neutral/civil manner. He continued to rage at me, showing his true colors and what he really thought about me. He threw a ton of insults and accusations at me, fully enraged and flipping the script as expected. I felt disappointed and hurt, thinking how he was simply proving my point. I blocked him and went no contact before he could continue hurting my feelings.\n\nReflecting on everything now... There were a multitude red flags from the start. He was love bombing me HARD, especially in the beginning. He began to punish me if I talked to friends, coworkers, strangers. He began to make rules for me, such as I wasn't allowed to talk to people he didn't approve of, I wasn't allowed to participate in social events, and so on. He made me feel like I was fully responsible for his emotions and feelings. He was highly suspicious of every single person, including his own family.\n\nThese red flags started small but got bigger and more intense and rage-filled the more time passed.\n\nI realized he was carefully training me to coddle him and to behave how he wanted. If I noticed a shift in his tone or emotions, I would begin to scramble to fix it and make him feel better. He would punish me by switching personalities and then reward me by switching back to the personality I met in the beginning. The personality/mood switches became more frequent and intense.\n\nRereading through all of our conversations, it's all right there. Plain as day right in my face in black and white text. In the moment though, I didn't notice it. I did have random gut feelings throughout the relationship that things were not right or healthy. I ignored these gut feelings because I wanted this relationship to be real, genuine, healthy. I told myself, it's fine, it'll get better.\n\nI am now focusing on healing from that experience. I find myself \"missing\" him, but I know I'm only missing the constant attention and love bombing he was feeding me. He knew I was a lonely person and took advantage of that. I miss the person I thought I met. I'm realizing I didn't find a hidden gem, he's a 30 year old abusive and emotionally unintelligent grown man with no job, no license, no ambition, living at home with his parents, and preying on vulnerable women.\n\nI'm way less exhausted now though. I now have time for myself and the people I love. I'm sleeping normally now. I'm not dedicating every waking minute to him. I'm not constantly checking my phone and panicking to reply immediately. I can finally breathe.\n\nETA - Dealing with going in and out of wanting to contact him and \"fix\" things. I know it isn't real, I've done this song and dance too many times. I'm so tired. I hate dealing with what feels like withdrawing from love bombing. I want and miss the person I thought he was. I want that all back. But I know it isn't real. I'm just going to turn my phone off and go to bed to avoid making a mistake. I don't know how people can do this to other people. I'm so weak right now, if he showed up I would hug him and cry my eyes out. ",

I was panicked, I begged to have them turn me over because I couldnt breathe. I have a long history of childhood sexual abuse, and rape, and he had his 230 lbs, holding down my 120 lbs when 911 showed up. They took over. I was bruised on every surface of my body. I have a pacemaker, and every time I tried to lift my shoulder to catch air they would slam me down. I spent the night in the emergency room. I know my rights, and Im experienced in mental health detainments. I have no history of suicide attempts, or thoughts. The Mental health professional interviewed me in the morning and released me. she put in her report that he was using 911 to abuse me.\n\nI have recently been poisoned with low doses of carbon monoxide gas. I went to the emergency room, poison control said it was a very simple test to see the levels of CO in my blood. The emergency room staff pulled up my records, and turned to me saying \" are you sure its not your mental illness? \" Then the emergency room dr said Im going to put you on an IV and hydrate you, I said all I need you to do is a blood draw, the treatment for CO poisoning is O2...He said I think you are going through alchohol withdrawals!.\n\nThe symptoms or CO poisoning, are confusion, lethargy, loss of consiousness. three weeks earlier I had fainted at my counselors office, and went to the ED.  His smear campaign not only affected my family, (noone talks to me), my finances, I have none, and he spent thousands to see me completely broke, I ended up homeless, and now Im living in and old trailer that I cannot park anywhere.  I almost died and was unable to get proper treatment.\n\nI challenged the hospital records when this all happened in 2019. They refused to change the record. I dont know what to do. I had the same dr for twenty years. He started going to him and was telling his the same. He was taking weeks and weeks off work to get sloppy pass out drunk. I found out after three years that he was taking FMLA to car3e for his \"mentally ill wife!\". We got divorced and he is currently on probation at work for his alchoholismn. They forced him into treatment and he has to take random urine tests.\n\nI dont know what to do, He has paid people to gaslight me, and hes put me in abject poverty. I am 61 and he is 48.

        "Text": "I was in a relationship for almost a decade, and now that it is ended and I'm in a healthy relationship I am unraveling a lot of the behaviors my ex had. We also had a 16 year age gap, we met when I was in my early 20s. At the time is didn't seem too weird because I has always grown up with people thinking I was older and older men wanting to date me. As messed up as it is to say, I always felt lucky he wanted to be with me and it set us up for uneven power in the relationship from the get go.\n\nThe following are some of the notable experiences I had in that relationship:\n\nWhen I would get hurt, he would just ignore me and act like I wasn't there or in pain and eventually when I asked him about it he explained to me that he thought cries of pain were for attention (they really weren't...just an involuntary response).\n\nHe wouldn't ask me about my day or how I was feeling or anything about my internal world. I asked him once about it he told me that if I had something I wanted to share that he expected I just would. He spent a lot of time talking about himself or reorienting the conversations back to himself.\n\nHe was hyper critical of how I was or what I did (including being anxious and not being able to relax around him ... I wonder why). I spent almost a decade trying to make myself better so that he would except me. But ultimately he always had another reason I wasn't a good partner.\n\nForgetting every anniversary and also explaining why me getting upset about that was me being too sensitive or caring too much about social structure, conventions. Or sometimes saying he was sorry and that he should do more to remember. But for an incredibly organized person who used multiple to do lists and calendars he could never find a way to remember.\n\nWhen I would get home he wouldn’t look at me or acknowledge my presence not even a hello and when I would bring it up he would explain why he didn’t feel like he missed me and didn’t want to have to act like it meant something for me to be back after an absence.\n\nNo compliments or kind words, I love you in response almost entirely. One time he went over 6 months without telling me I was “pretty” no deep compliments. I honestly felt like he didn’t ever see me.\n\nThese are just some of the things I experienced in this relationship. It took me a long time to leave because I honestly thought I loved him. He was also very different around other people and honestly people think he's so amazing that I just thought I was a depressed, anxious, crazy, angry person (and he told me that too). Ironically he was obsessed with the idea of empathy but I often felt it was a mental exercise rather than a true empathy of feeling. I also wonder if he is a sociopath, but I don't know if that's too harsh a term to describe him.\n\nThe hard part is I still don't know what to think of what I experienced. Does it matter if there is the label of narcissist? I have some trauma from that many years living in that environment. And I guess I know when I finally did get the strength to leave he made sure I was the bad guy, and most people will never know how he really treated me. He's still the victim after all that.\n\nI guess I'm looking for closure just by sharing a mostly secret (and shame filled) experience, so thanks for reading. Any advice on how to let it go is welcome.",

The day of our first date, he had a shift in energy. He was dry and became rude. I hadn't noticed this in him before so I thought maybe he had a bad day. Months went on and at least once a week he would have a day where he would be ugly towards me and I would become frantic trying to fix it. This went on until I left a year later. Then I found out I was pregnant. During that time we had worked on our relationship and I felt that we were in a good place. I noticed that I had cut out a majority of my friends as some of then were men I felt like that was understandable. After our baby was born, I found out that during my last trimester he was requesting nudes from other women. This broke be since we had a decrease in our intimate life. I felt like something was wrong with me since I was present in his life and he had no desire to pursue me instead of women on snapchat. Anyways, now again, about a year later, we have relocated back to my hometown and I hear comments daily about how I don't make him feel loved enough and he tells me that I gaslight him constantly. I feel like I don't have enough energy to attention him anymore. Yesterday was our sons first birthday and I bought nearly everything for it. He finally helped me try to set up and bought the food for it. I was running around full speed for the entire day it felt like. At the end of the party, he was upset because I called him by his name instead of babe. I felt defeated. I worked my ass off for the party and not a wow, it looks good or anything. Just \"the punch is nasty\" and \"now you wanna call me babe?\". I feel like I am not able to think clearly. Am I the narc for wanting him to acknowledge some of the work I did? It seems like major days I put in forth 90% of the effort and I do it for my family and our son as I grew up poor, I tend to want to \"go all out\". But I just wish he would acknowledge my efforts and understand that I am tired at the end of the day. This morning when he got home from work he was upset with me for staying up all night and not washing the baby bottles. I'm off today so I figured I would do it then. He then accuses me of my sisters boyfriend coming with her to my house and insinuates that I have some sort of attraction to him. I don't. My sister came over and we ate dinner and she left. But I feel like I have do describe the entirety of the evening in depth to make him believe me. I just feel exhausted, defeated and careless most days. I know that it isn't always best to stay together for the sake of children but I just keep hoping life won't always be this way.",

Keeping it all inside for so long can make it difficult to talk about, sometimes I even feel fear because of it. Anyways - I think my plans have come together, almost as if everything aligned perfectly. I’m in shock, I’m grieving , I’m happy, I’m scared , hopeful. all while trying to pretend everything is normal when honestly I am not doing it that well. It’s true what they say when you see it you can’t unsee it. Their behavior in front of people vs alone is jarring to me now. The way I realize they barely know anything about me now because they never engage with me, the intense lack of intimacy of any kind. I notice they’re trying to hang out and be around me more, not because of anything other than trying to get intimate and honestly I just can’t do it. (After I reject them they don’t want to hang out anymore, shocking) They mope around about it. the  next 3 weeks are going to be so difficult but I just want everything to normal until then. I’ll just put up with it, I’m starting to see how shot my nerves are from this relationship and I’m just feeling relief. They won’t be here when I move, I can move in peace without being afraid of having to break it off in person. No mind games, word salad , guilt …or worse. Not having to rush to make sure I can get all my things safely. I’ve been surrounding myself with people who genuinely enjoy me, it’s been giving me such hope that it’s not going to be as bleak as it feels. Decorating my own room not having to answer to anyone, doing whatever I want and being myself. It’s been such a long time,  too long. I miss myself. ",

We didn't motivate eachothee to do anything but fall knee deep into a smoking weed addiction. Not only that but she's cheated on me more times that I could count on my fingers toes and probably someone else fingers and toes. I accepted it for a while because I “loved” her, in reality I didn’t respect myself enough to leave and call it quits. My breaking point was when a woman had gone to lengths to get my phone number and continuously harass me until I finally gained enough sense to leave my ex gf forever. After that well you know we tried to stay friends but you know how that goes, it turned toxic real quick and that’s when another realization hit me that not only did she never truly respect me even as a human but she never cared enough to think about the actions she did to me. She told me two weeks after that she had a threesome with her co-worker and her ex who never left us alone when we were in a relationship and it caused me to have a meltdown where I admittedly said rude nasty things that I could’ve kept to myself. Also to give context we broke up April 2024 I stopped fully trying to have her in my life late may early June. I then began pursuing things with my now gf which has been blossoming. Ever since then she has no stopped harrassed me like posting revenge porn on my Snapchat, putting dog shit and eggs on my car three times, getting her ex to show up to my house and try to fight me, coming to my job with her ex and her mother (didn’t say anything to me tho) broke a mirror of my car then put it back,broke a painting in half and wrote rude comments on it, called me from a different number just to call me names , had her ex make fake accounts to try and again fight me even getting her 10 year old sister involved by having her make TikTok’s about me and finally breaking into my house just to steal a 12 pack of coke and my favorite chips and flipped all the pictures I have of me backwards. And the thing is , is that I had a ring doorbell camera but she broke up by going on to the neighbors porch and snatching it right off so I have absolutely no proof. I’ve went to the cops and nothing. I’m so tired of this and I genuinely don’t understand why she can’t let me go. If anyone has any idea of what I can do please let me know.",

I've had a lot of therapy and spent a ton of time on my own and with friends and family, just enjoying the quieter things in life. I've really come to love my own space and time, and I've developed a deep appreciation for my loved ones and the little things. I'm extremely independent.\n\nI didn't date or even think about another guy for the past 1.5 years because I wanted to work on myself. Now, I feel like I've made a lot of progress and I'm finally ready to start something new.\n\nOver the past year, I've been in touch with an old friend, even though we're living in different countries. He's considerate, calm, open, kind, safe, and creative. I trust my gut about him. We met up a few weeks ago, and I felt so safe and warm around him. It's been amazing.\n\nBut I find myself overthinking and constantly worrying that I'll mess things up. I'm not worried about red flags (I'm definitely keeping an eye out for those), but more that I'm rushing things and will become the anxious, dependent mess I was before. I already panic when I don't hear back from him (my ex would stonewall me a lot) and I'm checking socials too much. I don't want to go back to that.\n\nHow do you keep yourself in check when dating after no-contact? I'm thinking about starting to journal again, but I feel like I want to rush everything. Plus, I want to make sure I keep my identity and independence this time, since I lost those so quickly before.",

        "Text": "I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into the very first lie that ever came out of his mouth. I was 28 and at the time I was his boss. He was a truck driver who was not allowed to leave the state due to his age. So he told me he was 25. Told me he was never married but he had a kid. The very first date we ever had he moved right on in with my son and I. Within 3 days he told me he loved me. And within a week he had already proposed to me. I found out shortly afterwards that he was married, but he claimed he was separated and living with his sister. I asked him if he had any other skeletons in his closet and he told me that he was not 25 but that he was 20. So I was 8 years older than he was. How stupid was I? I mean really? I fell for it hook line and sinker! He told me not to give up on him he told me that he was legally separated from his wife. And I bought it all. 30 years later I am now in that same boat. During our marriage he went out and found his play toys, meaning new girlfriends. He had to always have the best of the best when it came to computers, game consoles, tvs, cars etc.. I finally got the nerve to file for divorce and the only reason I was scared to begin with was because he always said that if I filed for divorce he would take everything from me. I will tell you this he is trying his darndest to keep that promise! He came to me with a child that I had to pay child support for, a divorce that my mother had to pay for, he didn't have a car, two bags of clothes, a felony and a domestic violence report. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to forgive your old self. I filed 2 years ago and I'm still trying to forgive myself. The only blessings that came out of that marriage were my daughters. Does anybody else have any other experiences similar to this? I'm still going through the divorce. Which has turned very contentious. And I really don't know what to do. What have your guys's experience been leaving a narcissist and what's the recovery time?",

        "Text": "Title sums it up.  Was talking to my narc and of course the conversation devolved into a pity party for the narc and me being a dumb ass, trying to build up her confidence and reassure her that she's the best artist that has ever walked on God's green earth; basically pouring my empathy into a very bleak, very unrepentant, black hole of negativity and thoughtless cruelty.\n\nNaturally, she took this opportunity to insult me on top of completely rejecting anything I had to say. I'm used to it; it's the same old formula for us. She belittles her own talent, I try to pick up the pieces, she takes them and shoves them down my throat.\n\nThe reason we started talking in the first place is bc she read some stories online that I'd written, and she really liked them. Blew me up with all these flattering comments, drew these beautiful pictures to go with them, and I have to be honest: she's an incredible artist. That isn't me just blowing smoke, I genuinely feel this way, as do tons of other people, as evidenced by her massive online following and making fucking bank off her commissions. \n\nGuys, she love bombed the fuck out of me. I'd never experienced something like that before. I had no idea what was even happening. A lot of my stories were written to attain catharsis about abuse and trauma I've suffered in the past, and I was very candid about it. She made it seem like she understood, like this really resonated with her. \n\nNow I'm starting to understand that the subject matter of my stories is probably what attracted her to me in the first place; I set myself up as kind of an easy target, I guess. It's so disturbing to see this in writing. My stories, that I used to cope with past abuse, brought another abuser into my life. It's like I opened the door and invited the wolf inside my home. \n\nAnyway, the past year has been a steady stream of gaslighting and criticism and having everything I say and do be picked apart or diminished or rejected entirely. Over time, I just stopped arguing or standing up for myself bc it just wasn't worth the battle. She's very good at flipping the script and making herself the victim; suddenly I'm the monster bc I try to set a boundary or tell her that she's hurt my feelings - again. \n\n\"You're too sensitive. It's tiring.\"\n\n\"If you keep projecting your paranoia onto me I have to be honest, I'll stop having feelings for you.\"\n\n\"If you try to ignore me I'll just fall in love with someone else.\"\n\n\"If you don't pay for the shipping costs I'm not sending you any more presents.\" (Btw, I never asked for presents. I told her I didn't need presents. She sent them anyway and then guilted me about the cost.)\n\n\"If you keep acting weak I'm going to stop having respect for you.\"\n\nI've never met a person who seemed so comfortable with tearing me down. I've never been spoken to this way by someone who claimed to have feelings for me. She seems to delight in making me sad; she loves knowing she's had a negative impact. She's told me this. \n\nWell, today I just couldn't take it. I don't know why. Maybe I'm finally done, I can't really say. I told her I love her work and it's beautiful, and she fired back with \"You don't even know what's good\", and I don't know. It just really triggered me. I'm so sick of her belittling me. At one point she loved everything I said, wanted to hear every opinion I had, and I know it was just part of the love bombing and not at all sincere, but to go from that to having almost everything I say and think and feel be wrong... it just hurts. It hurts. \n\nI'm not asking anyone to drown me in sugar or hang on my every word, but Jesus Christ, I'm so fucking sick of being criticized and turned into her punching bag. I'm sick of walking on eggshells. I'm sick of stifling myself bc I don't want to provoke her or bore her or quite possibly make her focus on someone other than herself for more than a few seconds.\n\nI've watched myself disappear over the past year. I've been struggling since covid hit, with isolation and depression and postpartum and suicidal thoughts. When she found me, I thought it was a blessing, a light in the darkness - i even told her this! But I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm always so open with her and she always makes me pay for it. Does anyone else's narc taunt them with their fears? I told her I'm really scared of spiders and ever since, without provocation and even when we seem to be okay, she'll just randomly send me pictures of spiders. I know it's stupid, but jfc, who does that!? And this isn't even the tip of the iceberg. \n\nSo, after she snapped back at me again today, I let it sit for a while. I didn't respond to the text. I told myself I wouldn't respond bc it never does any good. It's always the same. I either end up apologizing or she gives me a half-assed \"apology\" -\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"\n\nIsn't that the biggest pile of bullshit ever, lmao? \n\nBut when I found myself starting to cry and having to try and hide it while working and talking on the phone to a complete stranger, I knew I couldn't just shut my mouth again. She had sent me a text saying she was going to bed and that she knows she's a \"difficult person.\"\n\nI wrote back that this transcends being a difficult person. I told her that she's just being mean and I don't deserve to be treated this way. I told her \"you can't talk to me like this and I'm not discussing this (ie, her lack of confidence with her art) with you anymore.\"\n\nShe hasn't responded. I have no idea if she's going to (she's been known to give me the silent treatment when I've stood my ground in the past), and if she does, I have no idea what the fallout is going to be. She probably won't care, bc she's already made it clear that I don't matter to her. I'm just supply to her, stupid, readily available supply, nothing more, nothing less. And I'm fine with that. Any pure, loving affection I had for her is dead. Now I think of her with dread and anger; a deep, fearful hostility. I don't care if she's sad or happy. I don't care if she's anything. \n\nI just wish to God I could let her go. ",

I was lonely and craved connection when I met him, which he sensed like a shark smelling blood.\n\nHe would gaslight, lie, cheat, manipulate, and ghost me. He tried to isolate me from my loved ones and sabotage every event or accomplishment that was important to me. He even went as far as to try to get me to relapse on substances. He knew I was in recovery and my past drug of choice, so he bought some and left it in plain sight just to trigger me.\n\nI tried to leave multiple times, but he would use an app that allowed him to text and call me from different phone numbers. So, no matter how many times I blocked him, he could always just use another burner number to contact me.\n\nOnce I left for good, the harassment didn’t stop. I had to finally change phone numbers and move several states away, because he kept attempting to reach me.\n\nI can sense that he still looks for me, though I’ve long since stopped checking up on him. No matter how many times I told him I didn’t want to be with him, I think he is so lost in his own delusions that he believes he could still come back into my life if he found me.\n\nWhat he doesn’t realize is I don’t want to be found. I love being gone. I love that I can’t be reached. I’ve created an entirely new world for myself that he can’t taint or sabotage. I’m safe, hidden, far away from him.",

She made my life miserable, like all overt narcissists do, smear campaigns, bad mouthing, and such. Then, I moved away to a different country for college. \n\nMy first roommate was a narcissist, and I lived with her for 1.5 semester and she, again did everything that  narcissists do. She gaslighted me about the different situations that we had in the house and she turned everyone she possibly could against me through her smear campaign and I was left with no support and I was all alone and did not have any friends either because it was during COVID times. \n\nThen, after that, I moved into another house for the rest of the 0.5 semester, and this housemate as well was a narcissist. I changed house after the semester was over and lived with some other people, but I still encountered some issues with them like racism. During that time I made a guy friend and was friend with him for about 2 years until I realized that he is a narcissist too and he would gaslight me all the time and insult me as a joke and said hurtful things to me. \n\nAfter a year of living in my third place, I moved to a different place where I met 5 people in that house, and all of the 5 have been narcissists and made my life SO miserable. All of my roommates were strangers and did not know anything about me. \n\nWhy are there so many narcissists that just pop into my life out of nowhere? I'm a really good person and incredibly empathetic but far from a pushover and will never tolerate someone mistreating me. I'm very independent, confident, and do not tolerate injustice. Also, any advice to prevent this situation from repeating itself and to prevent narcissists from entering my life at all?",

Met when I was young, very sheltered and naïve about the ways of the world. We have a 17 year age gap. \n\n2. Withholds affection until I have done something worth giving it.

They are a self proclaimed polyamorous person but doesn’t want the label, just wants to be allowed to date multiple women at once “legally” and I have allowed myself to be put in a lot of very uncomfortable situations I did not consent to out of fear of making him upset and getting silent anger for days. \n\n4. We have broken up 2 or 3 times, always over something I did or didn’t do, he is always the one that begs me back. \n\n5. When things are good, they are great. When they are bad, feels like the world is ending. \n\n7. Will put me down daily and say it is my fault for not knowing how to do things better or be normal. \n\n8. All my friends and family hate him. \n\n9. We live and share a child together. Not married, split bills 50/50 as much as possible, equal-ish parenting duties\n\n10.

Just to give some context: among other things, she'd often take subtle digs at me using my insecurities against me and then turn it against me when I took it personally, admitted to playing games with me and confusing me on purpose, told me she was mean to me around other friends because of my \"bad vibes\" and literally told me there was something wrong with me because I have social anxiety. The last straw was when she bluntly told me she didn't consider me a close friend because she had never once missed me.\n\nThe thing is I was a doormat. I was so trauma bonded to her that even after all of this, one of the last messages I sent her was to let her know I'd never seen any malice in her actions, that she shouldn't feel guilty and that I'd always be there for her. The very last messages we exchanged was the two of us agreeing to give the friendship another chance but neither of us has said a thing to each other since then. I guess I knew deep in my heart I had no more energy left in me to keep contacting her and was just trying to please her with that message. Needless to say I am no longer in that compassionate headspace where I think there was no malice at all. I am very angry and upset at how I've been treated and disrespected.\n\nAnd now to my question: last week was my birthday and she texted me, wishing me a happy day. I still haven't read the message. Should I leave her on read, not even open her message, or simply react to it with a passive-aggressive thumbs up? \n\n(I still feel guilty if I ghost or block her because no matter how much I think about it and how many people tell me I was abused sometimes I still think it's all in my head and what if she's not a narc and I'm being unfair and immature by ghosting her?)",

It’s like, I didn’t even have the freedom to do that. I mean, he wasn’t telling me NO you can’t shower. But it’s like I would subconsciously choose not to shower because I was scared that he might need something while I’m in there & if I’m not there to get it, it would set him off.

I’m not saying I’m perfect, but, doesn’t slamming me on his stream, which is live across the entire planet, and it’s make me more of the victim than he tries to play himself to be?

I can not bring up any issues to her because 9/10 times she’ll defend herself, tell me I’m too sensitive, tell me I’m cruel and/or tell me how I’m worse, etc. \n\nI started reaching out to friends and family about this because I just can’t talk to her, but I keep falling back into my old patterns even when I know she’s not good for me. I keep giving her the benefit of the doubt, I keep trying to communicate, I keep having compassion and understanding and patience with her. I have lost a lot of friends and family because they got sick of me always complaining but not being able to actually stick up for myself and choose myself. They got sick of me for centring her in my life so much and completely neglecting them in an attempt to save a relationship that was clearly failing. \n\nOn top of that, she makes it impossible for me to hang out with friends and family. She always wants to be invited or else I’m inconsiderate, but when she can’t or doesn’t want to go (this is often, and often last minute) she expects me not to go either. I barely hang out with my friends and family alone unless she’s with her family in another country. I have also lost people this way, because I’m simply neglecting them because I always choose her. She would make me feel bad for not choosing her for whatever reason, but mostly because she doesn’t have anyone in this country. Her family and friends are elsewhere and she only has me, her work, my family and my friends. She has put zero effort into building her own network in the past 3 years (apart from her 1 year in uni) and she also “doesn’t like” most of my friends and family (that much) - not enough to hang out just with them, at least. It feels like she makes me responsible for her not being alone, and/or she wants me to also have no one here because she doesn’t. At the same time though she thinks I am too needy & in her face too much, and she wishes I had more hobbies (I used to have loads). She also leaves to her family multiple times a year, sometimes for a month at a time. Are these narcissistic patterns? And how can I deal with this? ",

        "Text": "I regret the last 17 years of my life. I had fully invested myself into a complete stranger who is incapable of loving anyone including herself. Suffering from Aphantasia while emotionally stunted and having never developed the neural pathways needed to experience empathy, she interprets love as being ones willingness to be controlled. The more control she has over you, the more her twisted needs are met, and the more \"love\" she has for you. My codependency and my toxic need to \"fix\" damaged people kept me trapped in a never ending  cycle of abuse where I foolishly believed that she wasn't aware of her toxic behavior and it was all unintentional. Somehow I had been trained to believe I was responsible for the abuse that i had endured and I just needed to love her more. \n The fact is that she WAS aware of the pain she was causing and all of the horrible things that happened were 100% intentional and no amount of love on my part could ever change the nature of a person who lies, cheats, and manipulates people without experiencing the shame, remorse, and guilt that  normally would prevent people from behaving in such horribly selfish and sadistically evil manner. Our entire relationship was a lie and I had been conned into staying time and time again when my intuition was telling me to run and never look back and this cost me not only the 17 years i wasted on her but it also robbed me of my identity. I no longer recognized the person I saw in the mirror.. \n Once believing that I had found my soulmate it's now inconceivable that I must continue on as if she has passed away. Mourning the death of someone still walking the earth . It's the only way I can move on and I can't even begin to describe what it feels like to have loved someone so much and for as long as I did but then ultimately realize that the person I loved never even existed. It's not just heartbreak that I feel. It's the trauma of experiencing something malevolent and not knowing how to find peace after an encounter with something truly evil. I had no idea these kinds of people even existed and my world view is forever changed now that I know evil really does exist and this world is full of ugliness.\n",

He has alwats kept in contact with me and I foolishly reciprocate. The last time I saw him he had facetimed me and told me that he was really upset because he saw something that triggered him(he witnessed a death of a friend) and that he was supposed to be productive and clean his room but was too sad to do so. He basically told me that having sex with me would make him feel better and give him motivation to clean after. I gave in and we hooked up. When we were just hanging out after he mentioned that he had to go because he had plans with a female friend which I don't care about, but it hit me that he was never going to clean his room when he left and it was part of the excuse to rope me into seeing him. The more concerning part that I just realized it's so fucked up is that he guilt tripped me using the death of his friend. I didn't realize how disgusting that was until I really thought about it and it makes me feel so gross. Just needed to get this off my chest.",

        "Text": "Hi all, M25 here, recently came out of what was my first relationship with someone F30 and I feel like I was abused.\n\nActually met while coworkers, she was pregnant and with her boyfriend at the time. After she gave birth she said her partner kicked off big time and they broke up however they were still living together for a bit then she started messaging me and I was totally swept off my feet not having any relationship before - she was the first person to even hold my hand.\n\n While our relationship wasn't perfect I loved her to bits and she seemed like she did too but some things were very contradictory and found myself confused alot of the time but I ignored it due to how I felt about her. Her ex was always in the picture due to their kid but he lived 3 doors up and was there alot due to her having 2 other kids, one that saw him as her dad despite not actually being so. She left our place of work in October when her kid got ill and no one would cover her shift even though I stayed on past my shift to do so. Fast forward to June this year she got ill and repeatedly said I wasn't there for her despite me not being allowed in her house unless she said so and multiple attempts of me saying I will do anything for her that she wants me to. I wasn't the best boyfriend at times and I admitted that to her but I was willing to make up for mistakes I made but I was always hit with \"it is what it is\" and she proclaimed she wasn't happy for months although whenever I saw her she seemed happy and soft and gentle.\n\n At one point we had a disagreement that was mainly me apologising for not being there for her but she was constantly having a go at me and she said she wanted a break that but we could still speak. Every time I tried to make things right I was put down time and time again until she had a go at me for the same things over and over and we stopped talking for 3 days until she got in contact with me again and and I explained how much I loved her and that I was ready to step up and be there for her and her kids. At this point I had only seen her once in the last month.\n\n We started talking slowly again and about a week later I spent the night with her - no sex because she was still ill but it was really nice and she said she enjoyed it and missed me. Another week of slow talking - including her saying that we had broke up after the initial 3 days of no talking although she never actually said that to me but she needed to learn to trust me again and I asked if she'd maybe like to see me again soon and it all kicked off with her saying it was overwhelming her and she still loved me but she needed space. After a week of no talking I tried to reach out to her but she went on about all the stuff she had a go at me before and saying to respect her boundaries. Another week passed and I put a Facebook post that only she could see with some cards I had from her in the relationship telling her how much I still loved her and that I was willing to give up everything to be with her as I didn't want to message her directly. She then messaged me saying to take the posts down and that I had crossed another line.\n\n Shortly after that she unfriended me on Facebook and blocked me on WhatsApp which was our main communication method and the day after that she was friends again with her ex on Facebook and rang my coworkers and told them I bullied her when we worked together, that we had been broken up for a month and I couldn't leave her alone and other lies like overcharging her daughter at the shop I worked at etc. I never said a bad word about her because I absolutely adored her. 5 days after that with no contact she viewed my profile on tiktok to block me although she knows I only ever had tiktok to view things she sent me and then fully blocked me on Facebook too. In the 2 odd weeks we didn't talk I was in absolute bits not knowing what was happening and she knew how I felt about her, I eventually went on antidepressants to help get over it.\n\nI only really started to get over her once she blocked me but I only ever wanted closure as she never said it was fully over just that she needed space and boundaries. I'm so confused because the person that I spoke to over text and that has come out now wasn't the person I knew while I was with her. Was I naive and unable to leave her alone or was she just playing me the whole time and was never going to get in touch with me again?",

        "Text": "I've finally, after two years of being with this person, been pulled to the light by my closest friends that my partner is a textbook covert narcisist, and I'm done and ready to move on. But it is one hell of a task, and I just need advice from people outside of the situation. \n\nI've been with my partner for just under 3 years first year started off long distance with regular meeting which was all well and good it was a nice relationship but, it all change when we went to uni. I didn't know what course to do or where to go, and she helped me find one, but the issue was that she was going to a uni in the city 20 minutes away.\n\nI ended up living in a private accommodation (which she also found for me) in the city where she went to uni because I left it too late to look for places to live where I was attending uni while she lived on campus. Within the first couple of months she was claiming that the people living on the same floor as her were being really nasty to her and abusing her which I never saw happen but she was adamant it was happening so I just believed her. In response, I let her live with me in a room that was barely even big enough for one person. It was hell, but I wouldn't admit it to myself because of how much she had a grasp of me.\n\nJump forward a while, and we've both made friends, we have our own friendship groups, and we're discussing looking where to live. I wanted to live in the city where I was attending uni with my friends because and surprise surprise my partner talked me into us both living with my friends. \n\nJump forward to the start of the second year of uni, we are all living together, and me and her are sharing a room in the house. During this second year she displayed all the clear as day red flags and I just wasn't seeing them at all but all of my friends were seeing them and not just my friends that lived in the house my friends from outside our house circle aswell. \n\nTowards the later half of the year It got to a point where I just didn't know what was going on and I felt crazy so I started talking to my housemates and, they told me about some of her behaviours but they where being too nice about it to save my feelings because I was in so deep I just couldn't see my partner for who they where and because of this they pussy footed for lack of a better term around the problem which was her. So I broke up with her. It lasted the grand total of 24 hours before I got manipulated back into a relationship. \n\nA couple months go past and I start subconsciously clocking her behaviour until, one day she's doing her usual, feeding me reasons why I shouldn't like one of my friends, she makes a really horrible and quite frankly disgusting remark about one of my friends being sexually assaulted. I didn't stand up for my friend at all. I just agreed with my partner and shut down (which at this point had just become the norm for me). These events took place while we were at my family's place because she insisted we see them because \"she feels things are different with my family since we broke up\", but when we got back, I told my friend about what she said in front of the rest of my friends, and they laid it out to me plain and simple who my partner was. \n\nI wasn't surprised at all. I was just glad that it was finally over and I wasn't fucking crazy and that other people where noticing the behaviours. So my friend has a word with my partner and her mask completely drops in front of everyone including one of the friend who's confronting my partners friends who came up to visit. \n\nShortly after this, she storms out the house and takes a 4 hour train home. That was last night as of the date this was posted. But that's not the kicker. Contracts have been signed, and we are all living with my partner again next year, the last year of uni, and we have to start moving soon. As of current, nobody in the house likes, respects, or trusts my now ex, including me. I have written her a note fully breaking down why I can't be in a relationship (I have photos). I haven't told my parents or family. I feel like I need to worn more of my friends and myself and my partners' joint friends. I feel like talking to her old friends who cut her off aswll. What do I do, guys?\n\nPs she has done some crazy stuff to me and all of my relationships its to much to share here but i still feel confused about it all even though I fully understand what she is and, if you read it all thank you a lot apologies for grammar or if anything didn't make sense I'm just spilling it out my brain so I can process. Thanks, guys. means a lot.",

Ever since April they have been pretty bad, they’re bipolar and were switching meds so I gave him the benefit of the doubt as I am also bipolar. He’s been totally off the deep end on me quite a hand full of times during all this and I have broken down because a couple of these were those reality checks for me. One where I asked for them to not put soda cans or coffee grounds in the sink as it was going to 1. Eventually clog the drain and 2. I clean and it just feels disrespectful which I have mentioned this multiple times. In return I get a speech how I’m not up to par on things that he excels at which I’ve tried to learn but he doesn’t teach very well or help me by making notes (he is unemployed but is always so “busy”) and I’m wasting his time etc which I said I can see how we would both feel better if our time was respected by one another and he took that so negatively and started being condescending and I genuinely was trying to be civil but they treated me so childish and I tried one more time to be civil and just be respectful and in the middle of me trying to be clear and concise he yells some fucking nonsense like BREAK A PLATE ITS FOR GOOD LUCK. I started busting out crying because I genuinely felt gutted in that moment , like I knew he just didn’t care at all about how I felt. I genuinely can’t remember how it got to him screaming at me, but he started to threaten to break some of my stuff so I started audio recording because honestly I was tired of feeling crazy because they act so genuinely nice to people who aren’t close to them.  He was furious I was recording and I’m sobbing he pulls out his phone and genuinely started recording me having this moment, started saying look at how I’m acting etc. I’m so over this that I go into the farthest place in the house to get away from him, I wanted to keep my peace because in that moment it clicked what I’ve been going through isn’t right, but I didn’t feel like the problem in that moment. I knew, like I always did that this isn’t right. He started to antagonize me by “coming to check his laundry” but also give me another verbal lashing, so I didn’t respond really and said “okay you have your clothes can you please leave” he says something smart ass and my buttons were well beyond pushed so I screamed at him to stop antagonizing me and just leave me alone. He responded with “god, you really need some help” walked to the door stood in the doorway shaking his head “you really need some help” and aggressively closes the door. Later he refused to go to sleep until I deleted my recordings and proved it. I couldn’t sleep that night but he did after I did what he asked. When he got up the next day he simply said “I don’t even want to talk about last night”\nWhat really crushes me is the fact this doesn’t happen often but has happened multiple times in the past. It’s like there’s a resting period and I get complacent. Im not saying there isn’t intense neglect of me in those periods. I think that I’m attached and am so tired of the constant dysfunction when it’s good it just seems good. I’m trying to convince myself leaving might not be right the right thing to do but I know better. I really know better. This feels horrible, I feel horrible and I feel GUILTY for trying to leave while they’re on a trip when they’ve done so many things to me that were so fucking painful and I just had to move on. I just want to leave peacefully on my own terms without the absolute shit storm I know would come even though he said “I won’t make it hard for you to leave this time” ",

I realize that I don’t deserve this. And I realize that saddest part for me is the likelihood of him changing based on how he’s acting is probably zero. It was more depressing but I’m glad I’m starting to see his actions for what they are. I was upset though and frustrated because I am not sure since he did most of the talking that the therapist even realizes what is going on and we talked a lot about my problems and how HE doesn’t trust ME.

I know everyone’s gonna say leave him and I want to idk how or why I’m here. \n\nI feel trapped . I don’t leave the house except to go see him I can’t hang with my friends he bully’s me and calls me name . I went into kidney failure and we got into an argument on the high way he hit me on my side and said he was trying to hit me in the kidney. Idk why I stay . I know I deserve better but idk how to not only leave but to stay away. His manipulative used and abused me and yet I still stay . \nHis never wrong and always needs a 3rd opinion on anything and if that person dosnt agree that his right that’s another issue . It’s always him him him . I asked why he didn’t come to the doc with me for my kidney issues and he said he loves me but he dosnt feel bad for me so I could handle it. \n\nIdk go easy on me guys I know I’m dumb for staying .. idk why I even made this post",

        "Text": "I can’t decide anything it’s been almost 3 months since she discarded me and only 1 since I really understood what happened to me. The trauma bond and why I still wanted to and still want to be around her. It also consists of constantly blaming myself impulsive actions and I was unbelievably desperate to get her back to the point I drove myself crazy dealing with the hot and cold the lying. I just don’t know what to think anymore I’ve done my research about everything I’m in therapy yet I can’t stop the intense emotions of love toward her or the intense feeling of nothing. My creativity is gone and it feels like my brain is just in survive mode. like I can truly understand everything she did no matter how cruel and I do forgive her not for the treatment I received but for treating me that way if that makes sense. But then I have a day like today where I don’t want to know she exists. I have her blocked on everything I acted out of anger that day after really finally talking about it alI to a close friend who knew her and he explained she does this every time to every dude and to be fair he did warn me at the start but my adhd ass just proceeded to process the words than throw them out. I’m hyper sexual as well more than likely do to my adhd but it’s awful cause I can’t make any decisions. My body is telling me to have sex with someone and my mind will agree but every time I try to talk to someone I get the intense emotions of guilt and feeling like I’m betraying a person I still love regardless of the treatment so I stop before anything happens. I was not perfect in that relationship but I didn’t deserve to be treated like a dog almost everyday. Any advice would be amazing cause I can’t seem to find solace from the intense emotions and confusion I’m feeling. To make it all worse I only recently discovered I have adhd to im trying to process that with my therapist as well. ",

My dad wants me to tell him that he can’t see the baby. But can I legally do that ? I thought that I couldn’t legally do that. My lawyer is not really helpful.. he has filed for me to have full custody and for my ex to have supervised visitation but is not official and he (the lawyer) still won’t give me a mediation date, although I keep telling the lawyer that I’m afraid that my ex will take the baby. I feel so lost \n\nAlso- he tells everyone that I am crazy and keep the baby from him, he is also very manipulative. I don’t want to do anything that may make the court agree with him or think he is telling the truth about me \n\nTL DR: My ex is covertly abusive and manipulative, hints at taking my baby, no custody orders official yet, lawyer is very slow and minimally responsive, I want to tell my ex he can’t come around the baby and I but I don’t want to do anything illegal also",

It’s so hard to explain to someone how you can be so genuinely spiritually drained, far away from your true self that you become complacent because change is so scary because you cannot leave without a fight , stalking or harassment   …. I’ve been thinking about making a post all week here. I need people who truly understand this. \n\nI know as scared as I am of the future or being so far away from my family because of moving for this relationship that I have to do this. I know if I stay I will be unhappy the rest of my life. I don’t think I can do that to myself. When I left the second time I just keep remembering the peace I had being so comfortable not being asked to do small tasks adults should be able to do, cleaning because they just are “too busy” to do them. Even though I work full time and they are unemployed. I didn’t have to think about if I had to ask to go out without them. ( they invite themselves to EVERY SINGLE PLAN I make with friends. It’s so suffocating. Like I don’t even have my own life) if I hang out with someone they seem to have this over exaggerated dislike for I have to hear about they’re a bad person and how they’re trying to help me out. (What’s worse is sometimes he was right and it completely skewed how I thought about his advice in the midst of all this) \n\nBeing called insecure for things I had boundaries on, deflecting and blaming me for some of his insane behavior, justifying waiting outside of my job when I moved wanting to “talk” and then following me to my new house “for love” , reactive abuse that I carry shame for , confused all the time about my own thoughts and feelings. Being embarrassed by their entitled behavior they pass off for a joke. Never did anything for my birthday, no dates I didn’t make, plans I didn’t make. I could go on and on. \n\nAnd I stayed with good intentions because I loved them and wanted to help, but they refuse to help themselves. There’s an excuse for everything why they can’t clean, plan dates, are bad at getting gifts. Claiming they don’t know what I would like, that I’m mentally ill. I’m being dragged down by this and I know it. They often tell me that if I leave I’m quitting, and he is not a quitter, I’m quitting if I stay. I feel detached most of the time now but sometimes he poison creeps into me and I have to let it pass through because anything could be better than letting my life pass me by. ",

Not a spiteful thought... More of a... Revelation. She doesn't have the capacity to do that. That's what I want from her. By giving it to her it's a constant reminder that she doesn't meet societies simple standards of social interaction. Poor thing! I think I just solved my own problem?\n\nI'm that case, advice, cheering on, coping mechanisms, sharing of stories, anything therapeutic is welcomed. Today started so good but then so bad. And I'm going to make it good. \n\nI live with a Covert. I love her very much but know it will never be. I live here because I don't have family ties and no help from the state for homelessness. So I'm here with my covert ex girlfriend (I'm female if it matters). We have been doing this on and off living situation for the last 5 years. \n\nI know that she baited me and I fell. I am frustrated with myself because I fell for it. And now even more upset and crying which is making her look at the more of a saint. She makes mistakes but often doesn't apologize. She got mad I was filling the water por to soak it because she never washes dishes. It's rare she washes dishes. She got mad because in Mexico they're water Nazis. She turned it off while I was washing the dishes even though the water was being caught in her crusty ass pot. I turned it on. She turned it off. I turned it on till she opened her mouth. I told her I'm catching the water because this needs to now soak since you didn't clean it right away. Then it turned into so much more a blur of everything. \n\nI lost. I will always lose. And I had to lose because I'm competitive and good at what I know I can do. My day started off so amazing and then BAM\n\nIdk if I'm looking for support but definitely NOT advice. This is so much better than being homeless and in full-time school with three dogs. But other options would be impossible. \n\nPlease help in any way, I think I just want conversation because God knows she will never speak of this again whether it be an apology or just a talk. And that's what's so dangerous and toxic about these people. I guess I came here for sanity at the end of the day. ",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "BACKGROUND:\n\nI was with my ex for just a few months before he drunkedly slapped my face, the day after he had me convinced I imagined it, and apologizing for running to a mutual friend right after, seeking help. I stayed another year, mental health deteriorating, wlile my brother and several friends were begging me to leave. I was convinced I was the crazy one, creating issues and imagining things. The gut feeling grew, and HIS friends started warning me about him, saying he is a narcissist and dangerous. I was adviced to talk to his ex (of 5 years), her stories were eerily familiar.\n\nSo I applied to university, quit my job and moved to a different part of the country. At age 24 in the summer of 2022. He broke up at first, not wanting a LDR, but then did not want to let me go, stalking and frightening behaviour ensued. Some awful back-and-forth ensued. I tried to block to no avail. His ex contacted my mother, she had heard things and was afraid he might kill me...\n\nI agreed to be friends, hoping it would calm him down. He went back and forth between being the good friend he was before the relationship, and trying to control me - who I spoke to and what not.\n\nThis January I went no contact. Apart from a couple of weird emails right after it worked.\n\nCURRENT EVENTS:\n\nDuring summer I went back to our hometown, I have family there and friends I miss. I've become quite close with a couple of friends I met through my ex, who also have gone no contact on their own accord due to his temper and controlling behaviour. There are also others who I don't know as well. I think at least 5 former very close friends of his I think.\n\nTwo of them were playing a concert: three bands and I knew the drummer of one and the singer of another, so of course I wanted to go. It's a town of less than 300k people and a specific subgenre of metal, so of course I expected ex to be there. I went together with two friends who don't speak to him, and we agreed the best course of action should he show up was to not approach and politely deny conversation.\n\nDuring the concert he kept moving close to me, at one point poking me hard in the back with a finger, i simply moved away every time. In the breaks between bands he kept approaching the group I was with, so I found new people to chat with.\n\nAfter he got more aggressive with it, also coming over to talk to the ONE person I was with at two- or three occasions.\n\nAfter trying to find my friend downstairs and seeing the ex, I turned back to go upstairs again. He followed me in the stairwell, grabbing my waist from behind, and saying something I couldn't make out. As he has a history of being violent when drunk I just ran up the stairs and hid by a girl who's made clear she is not his friend, and her work friend. When he approached them too I found my friend I arrived with and we left. He too found my ex bothersome and was visibly upset.\n\nAFTERMATH:\n\nFor some reason this has brought back the feelings of missing him, the doubt about my own role in all the turbulence in our relationship. I feel like I was mean to not listen to him at the concert, and that I am cruel to be friends with his former friends and to show up at the concert on his \"home turf\"\n\nIt's so strange and upsetting - I was doing so incredibly well these past 6 months, as if I've found myself again, and now I'm just missing him and ruminating, just as confused as I was a year ago.\n\nAlmost like I had cut the ties to him and was free, but when he grabbed me he latched on and created a new, twisted connection...\n\nAny thoughts, advice, expeiences, anecdotes, good vibes, whatever would be immensely appreciated! <3",

        "Text": "I'm so lost. \n\nGoing into our relationship, my boyfriend opened up to me about his narcissistic abuse he endured from his father, and I felt horrible for him. He was the golden child, had no sense of self, said he feels like an empty vessel. Has a lot of other issues and is just a very hurt person. I thought I could help because I loved him more than anything. I never wanted to see him in pain, and I always saw the sad kid that he feels like inside. We are very young, and I don't know much about that dynamic, so I've done everything I can to help. I am very empathetic in the fact that he is figuring out his life and giving him space for that, while still being available always. I never have wanted him to go through anything that could hurt him ever again. I love him.\n\nThis is what makes it such a mindfuck. I can tell because of the way he treats me, that he has inherited so many of these abusive traits. I've tried to talk to him so many times about it but it gets turned around on me. I've done everything I can to help for almost two years, while still going through my own very difficult battles. \n\nHe hurts me every day but thinks he is doing nothing wrong. He does things a covert narcissist does and I highly suspect he is one based off of what I've researched. I could never tell him this because it would turn on me. He blows me off and dismisses anything I am going through because \"he has it worse.\" \n\nI can't feel lonely because he's lonelier (he has ruined my relationships with everyone but him, and barely makes time for me.) Can't tell him I am suicidal because that makes him feel bad (all I need is support.) Can't ask for emotional support because he never got it from anyone but himself (I am always there for him.) Tries to get a reaction out of me constantly. Diminishes my confidence and practically bullies me with unfair expectations. Lovebombs when he somehow can tell I'm questioning how he treats me. Promises things and lets me down at the worst time. You get the point.\n\nThere are times that he is the most loving and wonderful person i've ever known, but those times are getting so rare. I have to shut my mouth just to keep the peace. A good day is him calling me for an hour so we can talk more than 4 times a day over text about nothing. \nHe has broken up with me multiple times and hoovered me back every time because of how caring he has been to me. \n\nI know I need to leave, I just feel so guilty. He has nobody there for him because he won't let people in. I've told him things nobody else has ever known. This is my first love and I'm so lucky I have the resources to know this isn't normal, but that doesn't make it any less painful. I am afraid that if I don't leave I won't be alive much longer, but leaving is the last thing I want to do. I just wish it wasn't like this. \n\nCan the golden child become a narc while still being self aware? Is this common with people who have been through narcissistic abuse? Am I cruel for leaving? Is he even abusive? Am I asking for too much? Am I making it up that hes a narcissist? Is there any point in fighting? Does he even realize he is doing this?\n\nI don't know how I got roped into this. I feel awful that he went through what he did but he is putting me through it now and would never even accept that as the truth. I've given him so many opportunities to accept my help in major ways and he never takes them. Ive completely lost all sense of self by letting him decide who I become. \n\nI am planning on leaving this week but feel physically sick at even the thought of that. I love him more than life itself. What do I do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Text": "Left covert narc 6 years ago, he went to two african countries to do voluntourism to plaster his Facebook with photos of himself being a ‘good samaritan’ as he knew I was about to unmask him to everyone we knew. He then begged for me back, crying, insisting he was a changed man because he now appreciated life after going to Africa (awful and selfish motives for going there, I know). I said no repeatedly and he went on a month long hoovering campaign which didn’t work. \n\nA year after I left him, he got into a new relationship. My friend had seen his tinder bio which echoed nothing of who he is and everything I am, it was almost funny to read. He described the opposite of himself. \n\nThe new girlfriend is highly accomplished, academic and successful. I thought that she would endure roughly two years as I did then run for the hills once his mask inevitably dropped. Nope. Five years on together and now they have a baby. They live in separate cities, 2 hours apart, but somehow live this relationship and have a baby. \n\nI suppose it just feels like… when i left him, I felt so glad to be out of the fog of his mentally ill (or personality disordered) world and I actually felt a bit sorry for him that that life is his daily reality but I also felt sure that justice would be served and he wouldn’t get to then settle down and be happy with what looks like a great girlfriend and go on to get his wish to have a baby. And yet, he has. \n\nThe questions that haunt me are these- was his abuse of me just something I attracted in or provoked in him, and she doesn’t trigger him into abuse? Did he magically change for her because she deserved a good love and I didn’t? Does the fact my dad was abusive to me mean that men can’t help but be abusive to me via some subconscious urge they get around me, whereas women like her get treated well by them because they deserve good love and I for some reason don’t? Why hasn’t she seen through him yet? Does he not abuse her? Was I just the guinea pig then he sailed off into the sunset as a shiny new man for the benefit of another woman? How is she still with him after 5 years? Why has she attached herself to him so irrevocably by having a child with him? Why isn’t justice occurring? Why does he get everything he wants with zero comeuppance? Above all, again, how and why is she still with him? Did he only abuse me then and that’s just something I just cosmically get in life but he wouldn’t do it to others who cosmically don’t? \n\nAny insights greatly appreciated!!! ",

        "Text": "When I (21M) got into a relationship with my partner (20F), it was awesome. Then she involved her friends in the relationship. She came off as very codependent (“I’m very attached”) to her friends, even saying her friends (20F) are never wrong (you’re gonna see some red flags here that I was stupid to ignore). Met one of her friends - wonderful guy not a bad bone in his body, hope all of them could be Ike that. She expressed (I don’t even know jokingly) that her girl friends were jealous that she got a boyfriend - yet she wanted us to be friends. \n\nI have never met such hypocritical people in my life on first meet. They would criticize my career (I earn decent money in school), my race (they continually called me a brown boy), the fact I didn’t drink underage, they would question my validity as a partner in earshot much to my partner’s silence. They would criticize my colloquialism after poking fun at me- I would say “shut the fuck up” when a funny story came up while laughing. They would tell my partner (not me) that they didn’t like it (happy to not say it if it makes them feel uncomfortable) but then they proceeded to tell me to shut the fuck up with impunity. The double standards sucked. The dishing out but not being able to take it sucked. I was always made to be the villain. When I brought these up to my partner - “Oh you feel that way because they have siblings, and you’re an only child”. They showed up to my apartment unannounced when I was on a date with my partner (I live on the 3rd story). After the date was over, they would make plans to go out and say “This is a friends only thing”. \n\nI held my tongue for a lot of disrespect. The people were openly known in their friend group to be third wheels in the relationship. They used to call me a b-word and a groomer (because I had friends who were 2 years younger than me). I used to call the main instigator a horseface after she made fun of my forehead and looks. But then it was too far. They could say whatever to me but the moment I come back I’m in the wrong.\n\nThey would openly ask my partner “Did he even get girls before you” to which my partner felt she had to defend her “choice” in me. My partner had told me that we won’t talk about our sex life. I was like yeah ofc. Her friends then started to tease me with info from our sex life - and they didn’t hear it from me. I confronted her on this and she was like “Oh it was a wine night and we started talking”. It was all ok until she started downplaying my skills. Then when her friends made fun of me with this info - I would then make fun of myself and then they would go to her saying that THEY were feeling uncomfortable about ME making fun of MYSELF.\n\nThey would cause fights to the point where I’m crying and hoping I’m no more. I would dream they would make fun of me so much - I would get up and walk out (I actually did this once but chalked it up to having to take a phone call). \n\nThey would compare me to their brothers and fathers. Token me for my race but then ask me to set them up with someone from my race. They would make fun of my career, yet ask me to get them a job. I tried to play nice with these people. On my own birthday, one of these girls was stressing out over organizing a career fair, I walked 40 minutes to help her out. These people would cause fights between us and I would apologize to them about stuff they do to me all the time saying “I just want to be accepted by the group”.\n\nWorst part came when her friends pulled switchblades out on a moving bus as a joke and were brandishing it. I was the only voice of reason telling these people to stop, protecting my partner, motioning others to sit down and telling them that the group can get in so much trouble because of their idiotic behavior. Yet all her friends laughed at the fact I was getting serious. One of her friends had come up to me afterwards and showed me her palm, laughing. It was blood- she had cut her hands on the blades trying to play with the knives. Laughing.\n\nWhether it was them blacking out drunk, headbutting each other, and touching each other inappropriately- I need to make sure no one falls behind or gets in trouble. Her friends would smack me for sitting on their bed by accident just to charge my phone near the wall. Everyone would laugh. \n\nHer friends dressed up during Halloween as red flags (can’t make this up) and they kept making racial remarks to my friend. “Dance white boy”, “bathroom’s over there white boy”, etc. He took it as a joke the first few times but then started to feel uncomfortable. He told me wayyyy too late that this is what he experienced.\n\nOne day, I had fallen through my chair and winced in pain to which they laughed. I had enough of their immaturity, their laughter at my pain, their double standards, and their unresolved hatred. I thought since these people frequently call me out for every small thing (albeit behind my back), I can confront them directly and fairly (never confronted them on their behavior before). I asked them to treat me with some respect and just apologize. My partner stood silent as they continue to make insulting and demeaning faces at me and avoid the issue. I had a freeze response. I could not get any more words out of my mouth. Then my hypervigilance took a toll on me 30 seconds later in the form of an extreme panic attack (first one ever) where I cried and clutched my chest on a train. They called 911. One of the girls was smiling (albeit unconsciously). I sat crying with the doctor hugging me, while they called an Uber to go to a bar. They called the paramedics- they were heroes. I had enough, went up and yelled some disgusting things at the main instigator, who was making disgusting invalidating faces at me while I was approaching her for accountability. Called her a horsefaced. Told her “Why should I die on the train? You go kill yourself!” \n\nMy partner threatened to break up with me if her friends had told her to and told me I wasn’t fit to meet her dad. The next day, her friends guilt tripped her “You made a choice to go home with him instead of come with us to the bar”. They talked about how it was “bizarre” why I was so kind to the doctors and the paramedics yet yelled at them. \n\nPartner said “Oh they have panic attacks all the time”. “It must have been caused by something else”. “They make those faces even when their relative died”. “There was a girl who doesn’t like her because she didn’t apologize to her properly”. “She thinks you’re attacking her face - just like her dad and uncles”. “I don’t want them to get their karma”. “You know she doesnt get along with her father”.\n\nI had tried to apologize several times but they shut the door in my face and asked me to stand to the side or avoid any communication. A few days later, the pain in my chest was tough. I went to the doctor, got some tests and was diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia as a result of the panic attack. When she told her friends, they said “we don’t care he had a heart attack, we care more about what he yelled at us afterwards”.\n\nThen blame was shifted. I was the scapegoat. They were the ultimate victim. The whole group - people who didn’t even have anything to do with the situation brought up 9 month old issues that I had apologized for. I was ready to apologize for it all again. I begged my partner if I could fight for my story since she was sweeping everything under the rug. She told me “They don’t want to hear your side of the story - they don’t want to see you ever again”. Ganged up. They said I brought too many bad memories to the group.\n\nWhen I asked my partner why she lets such people run from accountability for their actions. She said how her father told her to never give up on her friends. How her father lets his friends insult him and his wife till she cries. And that was his takeaway.\n\nI broke up with her. I can’t be a doormat like how her mother is to her father and his friends. I told her she was truly spineless for letting this happen to me. Went to a therapist and got my diagnosis for CPTSD. I wasn’t perfect but I tried. I really did. I broke my body for these people. Lesson learned.",

Not mine.   He Keeps telling me what I missed out on. If I wouldn’t have kicked him out-I could’ve had it all!\n\nI don’t know what I’m getting at really in this post.  \nI guess I just needed to vent.  He is such a nice guy to everyone. Arrogant-but nice.  Except for me.  He insists it’s all in my head.  That I’m just a whack job.  \nI must be to continue in this relationship.  \nThanks for listening to my rant.   Any Advice is welcome",

        "Text": "My ex was enmeshed with her friends (I think they might be narcs). \n\nHere’s why:\n\nMy gf (at the time’s) friends bullying me and constantly looking down on me. Negging. Double standards. Obnoxious and reckless attitudes. Passive-aggressive enmeshment between my partner and her friends. Literally dressing up as red flags for Halloween. It was my first relationship I thought it was normal. I didn’t know better\n\nOne day I decide to confront them on something small that hurts me (after all they have no issue telling everyone problems I have before they tell me). They make immature childish defensive invalidating combative faces of disgust twisting their necks as if I’m stupid while I try to speak and maintain eye contact (like a human being with manners). I ask them to stop making faces. They rage, arrogantly state they can make whatever face they want, and shift blame to me/question my memory of the incident. I go through my first ever panic attack and then yell at them insults as they continue to make faces and even smile. They go to a bar. Partner threatens to break up with me if her friends had told her to. Friends guilt trip her for choosing to come home with me after paramedics left instead of joining them at the bar. They start to act like the victim and hero.\n\nNow, I had tried to apologize to them several times but they shut the door in my face and asked me to stand to the side or avoid any communication. A few days later, the pain in my chest was tough. I went to the doctor, got some tests and was diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia as a result of the panic attack. When she told her friends, they said “we don’t care he had a heart attack, we care more about what he yelled at us afterwards”.\n\nThen blame was shifted. I was the scapegoat. They were the ultimate victim. The whole group - people who didn’t even have anything to do with the situation brought up 9 month old issues that I had apologized for. I was ready to apologize for it all again. I begged my partner if I could fight for my story since she was sweeping everything under the rug. She told me “They don’t want to hear your side of the story - they don’t want to see you ever again”. Ganged up. They said I brought too many bad memories to the group.\n\nWhen I asked my partner why she lets such people run from accountability for their actions. She said how her father told her to never give up on her friends. How her father lets his friends insult him and his wife till she cries. And that was his takeaway. I broke up with her and got my CPTSD diagnosis.\n",

        "Text": "Dear Support Group Members,\n\nI wanted to share with you a recent experience that has stirred up some old emotions within me. I have been estranged from my narcissistic mother for about 7 years now, with occasional hateful messages still reaching me through my Dad's phone. Despite having her blocked, her toxic presence continues to linger.\n\nDespite these challenges, I have found solace and purpose in being an active member of our community. I am deeply involved in various aspects of community service, including participation in my son's school PTO, serving on several boards, and currently preparing for a significant fundraising event to support a local domestic violence shelter through \"Dancing with the Stars of (our town name).\"\n\nRecently, my mother reached out to me via my work email, bypassing any boundaries I have set. In her message, she made baseless and slanderous allegations against me, attempting to tarnish my reputation. Fearing the potential impact of her actions, I felt compelled to inform the organization I am volunteering for and my boss about the situation.\n\nWhile my boss and the foundation director were reassuring, the inner child within me still feels vulnerable and afraid of my mother's ability to disrupt the reputation I have worked hard to build in our community.\n\nI share this with you all not seeking specific answers or solutions, but rather seeking solace in knowing that I am not alone in navigating the complexities of family estrangement and the lingering effects of parental abuse. Thank you for listening and providing a safe space for me to share my thoughts and feelings.\n\nThank you",

I've written a detailed breakup message to text him, and I keep find myself getting emotional and just wishing he knew how badly he hurt me, but I don't think that is the way to go about it.\n\nHe has multiple times slipped up and made me know that him knowing he has an effect on my mind, positive or negative, is where he gets off.  When he hurts me he asks me how hes hurting me so that he can do more of it. I noticed this and began to refuse or lie and say he's not hurting me at all. I can tell how frustrated he gets when I do this, and it's the only time I ever see him panic. \n\nAll I want to do is tell him how much of a narcissist piece of shit he is and how he fucked up big time, his life will be a lot harder without me, I do a LOT for him on a day to day basis that he takes for granted. I just want him to realize what hes done. \n\nI guess what I am asking: \nIs there any point in telling them how they hurt you? Is there any hope that they will have empathy? Will me being real about the situation do anything but make it worse? How do I stay alive after this? \n\nI'm so lost and confused right now, but I am just thankful I don't have any physical obligations to stay with him like living situation or children, it's all mental.

She has done so many things to piss me off, I could write a novel about everything she has done to me. But my family never notices anything. She is the mother of my big brother so I can’t entirely avoid her. When she is visiting my big brother she always wants things done her way and she gets angry a lot, it’s like a Jekyll and Hyde behavior, one moment she is calm and the next she is furious and unpredictable\n\nShe also gaslight me once, she wanted me to get up early because she wanted to go home before it started to rain and she knows I hate getting up early. But then the weather changed and she decided to stay at my dad’s house. I asked her why she isn’t going home early and she said she doesn’t remember saying that and maybe she meant she wanted to stay when the sun comes. She also keeps guilt-tripping me and she took my water bottle back home without asking once when I was abroad. She also always wants to get stuff done and when she has finished she blames me and my dad for being lazy\n\nShe never has this behavior to anyone outside the family or people she is visiting rarely, but occasionally it has slipped up and she once blamed her friends for using her. They bought a car for her and they told her she could pay them back by doing food shopping, but then she got angry and blamed them for using her. She has also never paid them back\n\nSo how do I make my family aware of her narcissistic traits without upsetting them? And why are they never noticing anything and always defend her?",

My ex-fiance just listed my phone number as his wife’s when adding her to his car insurance policy. Since my phone number is attached to my policy, that also means he brought my policy onto his account. We never shared an account or policy, never had any association through insurance whatsoever. I open the app and see her name on my policy and his name on the account. I wanted and want to see this as a mistake in any possible way. But insurance representatives explained to me that based on everything they can see, his actions were undoubtably intentional. I still can’t believe it, still keep trying to explain it as an accident somehow. It’s just so completely bizarre and terrifying.\n\nI had a restraining order against him after consistent stalking, but dismissed it so he could keep his job. So why would he do this? Why risk it? He has a wife. As the reps said, she didn’t have to know she was being used in this at all, likely has no idea. Why do this? There are no words to describe the paralyzing terror of seeing his name. I had just started to feel at ease, only jumping a little at every sudden sound…now this. What other weird doors do I have to close and lock? I hadn’t changed my number because it was my dad’s and means something to me. I hate this. I thought he would just vilify me or erase my existence from his brain. Why do this? \n\nBased on your experiences, will this continue to happen? I’m just so tired. I thought I was free. I just want to be free.",

        "Title": "Escaping a narcissistic parent?",
        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "Hello everyone! Thanks in advance for reading. \n\nMy situation is a complicated one. My father is a covert narcissist, and I am looking to get out from the deep web of abusive control he has over me. This is a big life-story moment, but I want to include all the details to provide the best overview of the scope of what I'm asking for help getting away from, since it seems like most peoples' experiences are with N partners.\n\nIt started when I was 10, when I had to rely on him as a parent. Before that, I had a spine and didn't stand for his abusive treatment and would call him out on it, fight back, and run to my mom, who was able to get between and shield me from him. Then she got sick and passed, and in having to rely on him, we actually got along. \n\nWhat I realized a few years ago is that he lovebombed me to get me to trust him and treat him like his best friend. He spent most of a year doing this. I should have known something was off when he got super personally hurt and offended that I called my middle school bff my best friend in an email (no privacy parent) because I had said he was like my best friend, so I must have lied. But, I was 11, 12, and I didn't know any better. There was a period of time when our circumstances changed and he was more stressed, and he would get physically violent, but my teen self didn't think anyone else in my family or outside the home would believe me over him. Over time, that tapered off, but he went all in with the mental and emotional abuse to maintain control. It worked, and I have nearly insurmountable freeze and fawn responses, especially when he is involved.\n\nThese days, over a decade later, I still live with him. He is disabled and does literally nothing all day besides eat and watch TV (no chores, nothing) while I support him financially. I would go so far as to say that he has financially abuses me through guilt and manipulation. I have multiple maxed credit cards that I took to make ends meet after he mismanaged finances. We co-own a car that I am not allowed to drive, but make all the payments on (he pays insurance only). I pay all but one or two household bills, and he only pays those because he couldn't get me to pay them, and their absence would affect him way more than me (internet and subscriptions- I work full time). I am allowed to go to work, come home, make dinner, and stay home. If I try to go out in the evening  after work, even just one day a week with other transportation, I'm being cruel and 'there's a reason why isolation was used as a form of torture'. I've lost at least one relationship because I could not commit to things like going out on dates (72hrs notice that I'd be out was needed for the bare minimum to appease my father, and then he would lay on the guilt until I cancelled plans after the 2nd or 3rd date). \n\nIf I'm home, it's not to spend time together, it's to be on-call for if he doesn't want to get off his ass for a can of beer or to let his dog out. I talked about getting my  own car in addition to the co-owned one and he flipped out that it would only be in my name, as well as trying to convince me that I can't buy one without a license (I have a permit, and I am trying to work out licensing without the money for professional driving classes, friend/time availability, or his help). I want my own place too, but he insists that if we move, it will be together. He goes to therapy, but twists the facts just enough that his therapist has advised him that things like my \"surprise\" efforts to gain independence mean I am the irresponsible one, and he needs to set stricter rules and boundaries with me. No matter which way I turn, he seems to have omnipotent control over my life, and I know that that is my fault for enabling him for so many years before I knew anything was wrong--and after, because of my ingrained responses, and fear of his rage outbursts that erode my mental health and exhaust me. It's like he can't decide whether I'm his spouse, his 14 year old child, or his parent.\n\nIt seems like no matter how much I plot or plan, I can't get out from under any of this. Either my intentions get blocked, or the finances are not there to do what I have planned. I'm trying to do as much in secret as I can for safety, but there are some things that I know can't realistically be kept a secret long term, and it'll be even uglier when it comes out (like if I secretly buy a car so he doesn't suspect I've been driving \"ours\"). Being direct with him will cause me to lose far too much (I am very entrenched in this home and need to sneaky-pack, when I can afford external storage). I feel very directionless despite constantly coming up with multiple options for directions I could go, because they all seem to come out unfeasible. \n\nI know a lot of the immobility is fear, and the fact that I know he both cannot financially make it on his current income, and very likely wouldn't lift a finger to change it because he loves nothing more than to be a martyr, so I inadvertently guilt myself into being compassionate. I wish I could say that I want to go no-contact, but I learned in a happenstance situation that he and I are way better off living separate with low-contact, so I know that we are theoretically capable of a much less codependent, reasonably okay parent-child relationship, if only he would let tf go. Even though I should, I don't hate him. I feel pity for him, and an intense desire to not be this exhausted by his constant bs anymore. I want him safe and taken care of- just not by me, I can't do it anymore.\n\nAm I psyching myself out with self-doubt too much? And, if anyone knows any resources that would be optimal to help against this situation, I would be eternally grateful! I'll be trawling through the sidebar resources here soon, but I'd love to hear insights and tips on the situation if anyone has any! :)\n\n",

        "Text": "Hello, everyone. We’re only seven months into the year & I hope everyone is having a wholesome 2024 so far. I’m about to go deep into what I’m about to say so this is probably gonna be a very long post so bear with me. I’ve been having issues with my mother these past recent years & those issues got me suspecting that she could be a covert narcissist. Due to the negative events that happened in my life, it also had me wondering was I suffering from unaware narcissistic abuse? \n\nThis all started when I found out that my mom was cheating on her ex for the third or fourth time, mind you me & my mother has gotten into a couple arguments prior to this so I already had my suspicions that something was kind of off about her. In one of our arguments prior to this, we had a conversation about me trying to go to UNC Charlotte to get my masters so basically she didn’t approve of the program that I was applying for & wanted me to apply for another program relevant to my field. I respectfully told her that I was going to be making my own grown up decisions & pretty much implied to her that she was no longer going to be in control with any of the decisions that I make. Once I said that, the conversation went from being calm & her acting like she wants what’s best for me to her raising her voice & raging out at me. Therefore, I’m keeping calm & trying to calm her down & in the mist of this she keeps denying that she’s getting mad but yet she keeps raising her voice & being very hostile towards me. Eventually, I walked out of the house & went straight to my car & I started to tear up because I’ve dealt with this kind of issue many times before & Im just fed up at this point. It just seems like I can never get through to her or have an open conversation with her. I always have to walk on eggshells when it comes to being honest & direct with her. However, I’m a be honest she did give a good valid reason why I shouldn’t apply for that program but it was the way that she went about it that I had an issue with because it felt like to me that she wanted to have control of the decisions that I make more so of her giving me suggestions that’ll be good for me. \n\nOne day after that, we got into another argument & I’m not gonna go into detail about what we were arguing about because I don’t think it really matters but this particular argument made me see how cruel, evil, & childish my mom is. After that argument, me and my mother weren’t speaking to each other until I got home from work that following night. While I was at work I had a near death experience, this lady at my job almost ran me over in the parking lot & that instantly made me realize that life is too short & we can’t stay mad at the people that we love & care about because we never know when their time or our time is coming so that made me finally go talk to my mom once I got home. So I get home, I’m trying to squash the tension between me & her & I’m humbly apologizing to her about what I went wrong in our argument & Im also telling her what happened to me at work & how it made me want to sit down & talk to her & she going to decide to be petty & have the nerve to ask me “Was I looking both ways” “Was I paying attention” “Was I in her way” like it was my fault that I almost got ran over. Like she was literally trying to find an excuse to take the woman’s side & not show any sympathy or compassion to the fact that I could’ve probably been dead that day like she didn’t say I’m glad you’re okay or nothing like that. But I kept my cool & didn’t even acknowledge it but in the back in my head I was really pissed because what mother acts like that towards their son that she claims to love? Then at one point in the conversation she was on her phone looking at a Facebook post & I think she was low key trying to ignore me on purpose because she was paying attention to Facebook like it was way more important than the conversation I’m trying to have with her & she acted like she could careless of what I had to say to her. \n\nFast forward to a few months later, I caught my mom cheating on her ex for like the 4th time & at that point I just accepted the fact that she’s a full-blown hypocrite, a cheater, & she’s not this perfect person/parent that she tries so hard to present herself to me & other people. So that’s when I started to suspect that she’s a narcissist & I instantly revert back to certain events from my childhood to adulthood. When I was about 3 years old I was getting potty trained & I remember this vividly, but my mom just kept beating me every time I have an accident & then one day she left me in the bathroom by myself to potty train & I had another accident again but this time I try to hide the evidence before my mom came back but this time my grandfather had walked in & caught me but he laughed it off because he knew I was a toddler so he wasn’t mad or upset with me. Next thing I know I was taking a hot bath thinking everything was good, my mom come busting in the bathroom & started hitting me with a belt while I was in the tub in hot water & I was just screaming & crying & completely helpless. When I got older, I had mentioned this story to her & she was basically justifying her actions like it was normal & I don’t think she really apologized for what she did either I mean I could be wrong but if she did 9/10 I don’t think she really meant it. \n\nThere was another incident when I was in the 5th grade, I was playing parks & recreation basketball at that time & it was picture day or it was about to be picture day but anyway I don’t remember what I did exactly to piss my mom off I think I wasn’t giving her important information that she needed regarding picture day, I don’t know but for what I can remember I knew it wasn’t that deep for her to lash out the way she did & the reason I knew it wasn’t that deep because I was waiting for her to apologize to me for that particular incident which she never did. So what happened was, my mom got through finishing talking to my coach, & me & her are walking down the hallway & we were by ourselves & she started cussing me out & started swinging her heavy purse towards my face & shoulders really hard. Then when we got in the car she was on the phone with somebody & she started talking shit about me calling me ignorant. & every time me & her go see a family/friend, the other kids from the friends or family member could be cutting up or just be in the wrong in a certain situation, she”ll always blame me & I”ll always get in trouble by her for the stuff they did & it be obvious proof and evidence that I was innocent in the situation & my mom will still view me as the bad guy. My mom never really be on my side for anything & what really pisses me off is that she goes out there & act like she this ride or die parent that always have my back. Don’t get me wrong, I’m aware that parents are not always gonna agree with you on stuff but my mom is literally never on my side when I expect her or needed her to be. But if me or somebody else not on her side for something oh it’s a problem for her. \n\nHowever, Im not the only one that my mom has treated badly. I’m a start with her ex that I just mentioned earlier in this post, so my mom & her ex were dating for almost 20 years. They started dating since I was 6 or 7 years old so he’s pretty much been apart of my whole life. I wouldn’t necessarily considered him as a father figure because he wasn’t that masculine alpha male role model that I needed in my life. Most people in the dating world will categorize him as the beta male. Anyway, when they first got together everything in their relationship seemed to be perfect & my mom seemed to be very in love with him & it even got to the point where I was jealous of my mom’s ex & wanted them to break up because my mom will show him more emotional attention than me, like she”ll tell him I love you all the time like I wasn’t hearing that from her all the time. I literally felt emotionally neglected & it cause me to act out in school. The fact that I have to feel like that I had to compete with another man for my mom’s love at 7 or 8 years old really saddens me til this day. It seem like the only time she’ll really show me that emotional attention is whenever I see or visit my Dad & I’m a get to my Dad shortly. But anyways back to my mom’s ex, it was 3 years into their relationship & I hear them arguing for the first time. I’m not sure what they was arguing about but that argument lead to my mom throwing a vase at his face & flipping the kitchen table towards him & I think it was the same day she threw a tv remote at his face if not then it was a different other day but I knew she threw a remote at his face because he had mentioned it many times. At first, I was happy about it because I was starting to get that emotional attention from my mother over him & I was still that little boy that was trying to get all my mom’s love & attention for myself. They got into another argument that same year & then a couple days later my mom had some other dude in the house & I’m just confused as hell because I knew for a fact her and her ex didn’t breakup. So it was like early in the morning & I’m getting out of my room & I see some random dude sitting in the couch while my mom sitting on the floor under him & he just got his hand & arm around her shoulder like they were a couple & the weird thing about it is they didn’t even acknowledge me & my mom didn’t even introduce me to the dude or nothing & I was like 10 years old when this happened. Eventually, my mom’s ex found out about the dude, I don’t know when or how he found out but he eventually did & as the year progresses my mom cheated on him with 2 other dudes & was pretty much treating him like shit & taking advantage of him throughout the course of their relationship. There was one incident where my mom’s ex was snooping around in my mom’s room & saw the conversation she was having with one of the guys she was having an affair with & he confronted her about it & instead of taking accountability my mom got pissed at him & took the house key away from him. At one point, they were on & off mainly due to my mom’s constant cheating & I guess one day they decided to work things out & their relationship appear to be somewhat stable but deep down I knew they weren’t gonna last because the relationship was pretty much one sided from here on out. So my mom was basically stringing him along until she found someone better & that someone is the same guy that she cheated on him with recently which led to my suspicions of her being a covert narcissist. \n\nSpeaking of him, so one day my mom had introduced me to her lover for the first time after multiple attempts of hiding him from me. Mind you, I already knew about him prior to this particular day I just kind of play dumb & kept quiet about it because it was really none of my business so I was just going to let her ex find out about it for himself. So the next day or two, my mom just started giving me the silent treatment outta nowhere. The silent treatment that she was giving me lasted about a week. At first I was confused & lost of why she was acting like that towards me but I kept my cool & acted like it didn’t bother me because I know how childish my mom is & she’s the type of person that likes to get under your skin & I knew thats what she was doing so I gave her that unbothered energy that whole week & didn’t even acknowledge what she was doing. Looking back at it now, I see why she was giving me the silent treatment. So I guess that day when she first introduced me to her lover, I wasn’t giving her the reaction & validation that she was looking for so I guess she took it as a sign that I caught on to her facade & that I was starting to see what kind of person she really is & I think the silent treatment she was giving me was her a way of not taking any accountability for what she did to her ex.\n\nWith my Dad, him & my mother had a very toxic relationship from the jump. I”ll literally see them argue just about everyday when they were together. Occasionally, those arguments will lead to violence. I never knew or understood what they was arguing about because I was 3-6 years old during that time period. In most of their arguments, my Dad appear to be the abuser & the aggressor. I’ve seen him punch & make a hole on the wall, I’ve seen him punch and cracked my mom’s windshield while they were arguing, I’ve seen him pushed my mother, he made my aunt cry after she saw him & my mom arguing in front of her, & there was one night & it was late too, I was in the backseat of my mom’s car we was on our way to my grandparents house & next thing I know I’ve seen a white car chasing my mom & at one point during the chase my mom had stopped & the white car had stopped in front of her & next thing I know I see my Dad getting out of the white car & started running towards her & my Dad hopped back in the car & chased her inside into my grandparents house. Again I don’t know what most of their arguments/fights were about because I was way too young to understand it but I just remember my Dad being the aggressor for the most part. However, I did noticed a few things that my mom did that made her look not so innocent throughout the relationship. One day I was sitting in the car, & my mom & her ex was talking in the yard at his mother’s house & I see my mom flirting with her ex and being all close to him like her & my Dad ain’t together & I thought that was kind of odd. & that’s another issue with my mother, she”ll do sneaky & shady stuff around me like I’m too stupid to know or figure out what she’s doing & I take offense to that because you’re literally insulting my intelligence. & not too long ago after her & my dad broke up, she hooked up with this guy & I’m not going to go into detail about the guy she hooked up with because I don’t want to come off very messy but basically that incident kind of made me uncomfortable as I got older because he wasn’t the type of guy I will ever picture him having any kind of intimate relationships with my mother.\n\nFrom here on out, my mom has been bad mouthing my Dad towards me & other people to the point that me & everybody else saw her as the victim. My mom’s constant bad mouthing towards my Dad made me developed resentment & hatred towards him & part of that hate & resentment was me subconsciously trying to please my mother & get her approval. I lived throughout my whole life hearing my mother saying little to no good things about my Dad. I heard her say like one good thing about my Dad but it was more of a backhanded compliment now that I look back on it. Other than that, all I heard was how controlling he was, how he didn’t pay child support, calling him a cheater, how he was beating on her, just basically painting him out to be a bad father & a horrible person. Whenever my mom tries to point out my flaws she”ll say I get it from my Dad but when I display flaws that I get from her she”ll never acknowledges it. But if it’s something good about me she”ll say that I get it from her. As I got older, I started to have more mature conversations with my Dad & hear his side of the story with his relationship with my mother & he revealed to me that she’s been cheating on him, & that most of their arguments was because of her talking to some other guy & one of the main reasons why they broke up was because she won’t take accountability of her actions. Although I don’t always trust my Dad, but his side of the story made a lot of sense to me because I see the way my mom treated her ex, & the way she treated me & other people & I know my mom is very capable of getting people riled up. Therefore, I can kind of see why my Dad acted the way he did when I was younger not saying I approve his actions but at the same time I can somewhat see why he acted the way he did. Also, I noticed that every time I talk or interact with my Dad I’ll never hear him try to bad mouth my mom & that he actually loves me a lot more than what my mom tries to present. Throughout my childhood to adulthood, I never really heard my mom told me that my Dad loved me or really gave me the closure that he cared about me. She just acted like she always cared about me more than he did & she”ll make her problems with my Dad my problems or anybody else around her circle. Don’t get me wrong, my Dad ain’t a saint either, he has done some things that I didn’t like as well but I knew that he loves me & that he means well.\n\nI also had bad relationships & experiences with women. There was this girl that I dated in high school & she was my first girlfriend. The girl that I was dating she was verbally abusive. She”ll constantly make slick comments & insults towards me & she”ll kind of play it off like she’s joking or being playful & she”ll do it in front of other people too. As the relationship progresses, things just kept going downhill. One day we were on the bus, she was sitting beside her friend & I was sitting in the back of the bus & her & friend were looking at other guys private parts & my ex was saying how big it was acting like I wasn’t in the bus & me & other people thought it was disrespectful. So I texted her & explain to her how disrespectful it was & she didn’t reply to me until the next morning & of course like typical abusive people do, she decides to break up with me & proceeds to emasculate me by calling me soft, weak, & a pussy, like just saying every nasty word in the book. After that nasty breakup, I completely lost myself, I found myself lurking through her social media, & losing more concentration in school. I’m a be honest, I’m a take accountability for the stuff that happened between me & her because I really had no intentions of talking to her or dating her. I mean I did liked her but I liked her for the wrong reasons, so what happened was is that she started pursuing me & saying I was cute & sweet, & the thing was I wasn’t the most popular guy in school, I wasn’t the guy that was getting all the girls, I was rarely getting compliments from women & I’ve been called ugly in the past by others. Therefore, my ex made me felt wanted at the time & that’s what made me gravitate to her. Anyways, fast forward to my 16th birthday weekend, this was like 2 or 3 weeks after me & my ex broke up, mind you I still haven’t moved on from my ex because I’m still traumatized from that awful breakup. So I get home from Raleigh, there was this carnival around the corner from my house & my family wanted to go to the carnival but I didn’t want to go because I spent the whole day in Raleigh & I also needed time by myself so I can finally grieve from the breakup between me & my ex & plus I had a gut feeling that my ex was gonna be at the carnival too so I definitely wasn’t trying to go. So I’m over here telling my family I ain’t going, here comes my mom trying to force me to go to the carnival & then she gonna argue with me & threatened me to do chores if I stay home, & in the mist of our argument she try to make this about my aunt like it was her birthday & not mines because I guess my aunt was the main one that wanted to go so my mom was trying to guilt trip me by using my aunt as an excuse for me to go & then my mom was trying to made it seem like she was doing a good thing for me. Due to my mom’s constant threats & manipulation, she eventually succeeded of making me go to the carnival. So I get to the carnival, & of course I see my ex there & I immediately embarrassed myself. After that, I was extremely pissed at my mother & what really killed me is that my aunts acted like I had no reason to be mad at my mother as if she was doing something nice for me. Like they was literally defending her as if I was being ungrateful. Like first of all, I told everyone nicely that I didn’t want to go to the carnival simply because I spent the whole day with y’all in Raleigh so I’m tired as hell & I also needed time by myself anyway because I’m still grieving from that ugly breakup with my ex so I needed that time for myself to get all those emotions out so I can finally move on, second of all, it was my birthday weekend this is supposed to be about me if I didn’t want to go somewhere that’s my decision because It’s MY BIRTHDAY, I shouldn’t be controlled by somebody else on how I should spend & celebrate MY BIRTHDAY like that’s selfish as hell, & third of all y’all got me going to a carnival that I DIDN’T want to go only for me to see my ex there which was the very last person that I wanted to see & because I saw my ex & I ended up embarrassing myself due to all the bottled up emotions that I needed to let out privately. Ever since that day, things just got a lot worser than it needed to be between me and my ex & it took me a lot longer to completely move on. It gotten so bad to the point where I thought about committing suicide & looking back at it now I felt like all of this could’ve been avoided if my mom didn’t force me to go to that carnival & just let me stay home by myself like how I intended. \n\nFast forward to my senior year of high school, there was a friend of mine who I thought about asking out to prom. Usually I’m not too big on proms nor do I ask girls out to prom. I noticed that some men take their female friends out to prom so I wanted to do something a little different this year by asking my friend to prom. But I ended up changing my mind because I got the vibe that she really didn’t want to go to prom with me so I was okay with going to prom by myself. But of course, my mom being the controlling person that she is, she ended up forcing me to ask my friend to prom & make me go shop for gifts so she can yes. So I ended up asking her to prom with the gifts that my mom made me go shop for & at first she said she’ll think about it & then she changed her mind a couple seconds later & said yes. So I’m all happy, & we’re discussing what clothes we’re gonna wear & she even posted the gift on Twitter when we got through finish talking but she didn’t mentioned me in the post which I thought that was kind of odd but at the same time I didn’t think of nothing of it. The following morning, I get a text from her saying that she couldn’t go to prom with me because her ex told her that if she go to prom with me then they couldn’t be together & I gave her the benefit of the doubt & said okay. After that, I all of a sudden started hearing rumors that she played me & when I heard that that kind of hurt my feelings because me & her been friends since 10th grade & I didn’t think she will do that kind of stuff to me & she was the first girl that I asked to prom & I don’t even like asking women out so I felt like she ruined that experience for me. Due to those rumors, me & her just kept going back & forth & our friendship was just pretty much ruined. I mean me & her are still somewhat cool now but it’s kind of awkward because me & her never really talked it out like how I wanted she pretty much just dismissed the situation like nothing happened & I don’t think that’s healthy. & I felt like all of this could’ve been avoided if my mom never forced me to ask her out to prom because I was literally okay with not asking anybody to prom & going by myself & that’s one of the reasons why I still have so much resentment towards my mom because I felt like she interfered with my personal growth and development as a man. Outside of that situation, I just kept having more bad experiences with women due to insecurity issues & it was starting to get to the point where I can’t trust women anymore. Growing up, I was always taught how to treat and respect women but I was never taught how a woman is supposed to treat a man. My mom never really showed me the standard of what a good woman is.\n\nThere’s actually more things I have to say about my mother, but I’m a try to wrap this up & cut everything short. But yeah the issue with my mother is that she comes off very hypocritical, she can’t take constructive criticism, she takes no accountability for her actions, she’s manipulative, & she’ll judge & talk down on ther people for their decisions & behaviors when she does the same thing. For instance, she”ll keep saying that my Dad is controlling but she’s controlling, She”ll call her niece (my cousin) & other women in general a hoe for certain stuff they did with men but she did a lot of things too or even worse that will label her as a hoe, well at least according to her logic; She”ll give me lectures on how to be respectful to others like I’m this mean & disrespectful person, but I literally watched her treat her ex like shit, & hear her talk shit about some of her friends, family members, & coworkers behind their backs. Then she’ll judge my aunt (her niece’s mother) parenting methods pertaining to my cousin like she’s this toxic parent, when she treats her niece just as bad. Like every time my cousin do something that my mom doesn’t like or just get in a disagreement with her my mom would say the most nastiest things to my cousin that an aunt should never say to her niece. Like you would think my cousin is some girl that my mom had beef with back in high school that’s how bad it was. With my mom, she talk about other people’s flaws & try to hold them accountable with no hesitation but the minute someone try to say something about her it’s a problem it’s like we always have to be quiet about her flaws & whenever she does acknowledge her flaws she”ll try to justify it. I feel like I’m the only one that truly see’s my mom true colors while everybody else view her as the sane person & it even got me second guessing myself at one point that I could be a narcissist or I’m the problem like that’s how alone I feel. Even when my mom displays a couple of her red flags to others, people still view her as this normal person that doesn’t need help. \n\n",

        "Text": "Hi all,\n\nShort version: I'm curious if anyone here has had experience with Christian/religious narcs. If you have, how deep were you? And how did you get out?\n\nLong version: I believe my friend (I've mentioned in previous posts here) just got married to what I believe to be a Christian narcissist. She reached out last week after months of silence and said some things that felt like confirmation, but she seemed oblivious...which makes me wonder if it's just me. Here are the big things that have stood out:\n\n● He did the whole love-bombing thing while she was in a relationship (with my buddy). Using phrases like God spoke to him directly and said she was his, he's prayed all his life for a girl like her, saying \"I love you\" within a week, they'd be married within a year, etc...\n\n● He shared a video on his Rumble account that says wives should treat their husbands as their superior or employer.\n\n● He controls her phone, checking her texts to make sure she isn't cheating, wanting her to cut off contact with us. Apparently in a \"real\" relationship, you can't have friends of the opposite sex. He knows what's best for her, it's not controlling since he only does it because he cares...\n\n● He made a YouTube video condemning premarital sex. Then (shocker) gets her pregnant. When she wanted to tell us, he got super pissed. He then made her block us on most of her social media accounts.\n\n● He wants to have 20+ kids with her. Maybe it was hyperbole, but even so, that's excessively naive to think that's gonna happen. \n\n● He uses a fake name on Facebook. He only has two friends: her and another female friend he added. Although now it seems like they're sharing her profile, which is weird to me. \n\n● He's altered his tune slightly, saying it's OK for him to talk to other women but not her to talk to other guys. She admits it's sexist, but claims it's in the Bible that she can't have other men in her life. It falls under \"being loyal to your husband.\"\n\nI may not be the most devout Christian, but a lot of this feels like this guy is twisting scripture to control her and get what he wants. But either she's in denial or she really isn't see anything wrong with it, and it seems like everyone in the inner circle likes him and says she's happy.\n\nIs it just me (and a few other concerned friends)? Or does is this guy trouble? As always, thanks in advance. ",

        "Text": "Hey everyone! I am wondering if anyone can give me some insight on a relationship I was in for a long time. I am unsure if this person was simply emotionally immature or more narc aligned, so I’m hoping for feedback. Here are some standout experiences that happened over the course of our relationship:\n\n* I had a feeling as though he intentionally obliterated any special day for me. Our first year together, he didn’t get me anything for my birthday, stating “when would I have had the time” when I asked if he got me anything. I am in recovery, and he told me on my second year of sobriety that it was “just a day, and not that important,” and on my third year of sobriety he told me he’d planned a day for us… he had nothing planned during the day, but planned a surprise party for the evening knowing that I really don’t like surprise parties for myself. The party was planned so last minute that a lot of people couldn’t attend as they weren’t given ample notice. My friends were responsible for getting/paying for the cake and also setting up.\n\n* When I found out that I needed to put my cat down due to illness, my ex asked me if I was going to go into the room during the euthanization. When I told him “of course,” he stated that was “weird.” When I asked him why he thought it was weird, he replied, “it’s almost as though you like death.” For context, I have a deceased parent and sibling and my grandfather had died less than a month before he made this comment, as well. I do not LIKE death.  \n* He once made a comment to me alluding to the fact he was watching me eat snacks made him “fear he would one day lose sexual attraction to me,” and then proceeded to comment on my gym habits. For the record, I am nowhere near overweight - BUT THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER! I stopped going to the gym with him after that, and actually discovered an amazing yoga studio in the process.   \n* He once told me that he sometimes purposefully manipulates me just to 'fuck with me', and that he likes to see my reaction.  \n* When I would express how his words or actions made me feel, he would deflect and tell me that it “wasn’t that big of a deal,” or that I am “too sensitive,” or that it was “just a joke.” This made me have a visceral reaction over time, to which he would double down on his opinion and completely be unable to see from my perspective, which would eventually lead me to either cry or explode, to which he would turn it on me and tell me I was “unhinged.”  \n* At the end of our relationship, he told me that I “ruined his serenity,” I made him “hate his life” while we were together, and that I’m a “mean person,” all of which I know to be not aligned with who I am as a person. I will admit I did react at times (never violently) and had high emotions at various times throughout the course of the relationship, but my therapist and friends have pointed out that those were times I had been poked and prodded to the point that he got me there. He took zero accountability for any of that. In fact, a major circular argument we’d have was regarding his lack of being able to provide a proper apology. \n\nThere were good times throughout the relationship, which is why I stayed as long as I did. We lived together, and he’s in the process of moving out thankfully. The entire relationship feels like a blur to me, and it’s hard to imagine that it really happened/was real. Has anyone been through this? Any insight would be appreciated!\n\n",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "So I’d made a post here a few months ago asking if you all thought my (24F) boyfriend (27M)  had narc traits with some stories about “arguments” we had. We were together for a year. I had lots of help from people telling me he was a narc. In summary he would yell at me, make me feel like I’m not good enough, take his bad moods out on me and blame me for his bad moods, mistreated me during a really traumatic experience.  Since then we had split up and it was the best decision I’d ever made. It’s interesting how it happened. I felt completely deprioritised by him, he wouldn’t make any effort to free up time in his schedule to spend time with me more than once a week (which wasn’t a lot considering we lived 5 minutes apart by car). I voiced how I felt in an effort to see some change. He said it’s true, and it’s because he doesn’t want to spend time with me and blamed the reasons why on me. In summary the reasons alluded to me to making any effort for him, despite me making every effort for him even with me being in a long recovery from knee surgery. That conversation made me very upset and I left his house in tears. A few days later he said he’d like to speak to me and in that conversation he said he was not in love with me and didn’t see a future with me and wanted the relationship to end. I was heartbroken despite knowing he was never the man for me and begged him to see things differently (huge regrets, don’t know what I was thinking). He insisted that’s what he had decided but then said we both should have a week to think on it and see where we’re at. I believed he did that so I would be less upset but I understood what happened to be a breakup. Long story short, he tried to see me after a week and I ignored him. When I had seen him on a work trip I agreed to speak, in which he told me he wanted to fix things and didn’t want to break up and didn’t mean what he said. The following week it was the same, he regretted his words he didn’t realise would cause me so much hurt and genuinely wanted us to be together - crazy right… I told him in no uncertain terms could I ever get back with someone who can tell me they’re not in love with me amongst other things and then think it’s okay to turn around and say they didn’t mean that and that everything can be okay. Ha! \n\nSince then I’ve not really seen him. We have the same friend group but to be honest I’ve been avoiding anything I know he’ll be at. He’s tried speaking to me via text and I’ve not given him anything back. I’ve met someone new who I’m in a relationship with, he’s perfect and everything I could ask for in a man, the person I wished my nex could’ve been. Since being with my new man, it’s made me harbour a lot of hatred for my nex. We agreed to be friends when we ended (again I don’t know why I agreed to that in hindsight) so perhaps if he hadn’t figured it out from me not replying to him via text, he doesn’t know I hate him. I hate him because being with a truly good, kind hearted man brings up the memories of the horrible treatment I cried over time and time again at the hands of my narc ex. It makes me really hurt for my old self and what I went through by being with him. \n\nI’m so happy in my new relationship. I met him soon after the breakup and we clicked instantly. We have just been away on holiday together and it was amazing. I’m the type to post my partner on social media because I like to post things that make me happy. I’ve not posted him because a) I feel as though it will upset my nex and b) our friend group might question how I moved on so quick, despite them not knowing how horrible my ex was to me. And so it’s just drama I want to avoid on all parts. But it frustrates me because I know social media isn’t the be all and end all, but I still feel like my nex and his feelings are dictating aspects of my life and I hate it. Same for the reason why he doesn’t know I hate him and wish for him to never speak to me again, because I don’t want it to get out to the group and cause drama where I look like the bad guy cos again, they know nothing about what I endured in that relationship. I then feel strange for hating him because people say you can only hate someone you care about, and I don’t like to think I care about him… \nI’ve not told any of my friends from that friend group that I’m in a new relationship because it will get back to my nex. We lives 3 hours from my boyfriend where I’ve been spending the majority of my time with him in his city so it’s been easy separating my life with him from my life with my nex and that friend group we share - but it’s exhausting keeping all of that up to be honest and I don’t want to do it anymore but don’t know how to navigate it. \n\nTLDR: I’ve moved on from my narc ex into a new relationship and since being with my new boyfriend, it’s made me hate my ex for all the mistreatment I endured. I feel like I have to keep my new relationship from the friend group we are both in to avoid drama and it frustrates me. I feel like I’m living two lives and it’s hard to keep up with now. ",

        "Text": "After numerous back and forth trips between excaping my abuser and burning the bridges to those who offered or agreed to assist my mission. \nThis last time has me question the rights to womenn in this vulnerable position, with very limited to no support available.  A friend for over 20 years picked me up along with my 6 chihuahuas. We were taken to his home in plans to be a babysitter for his daughter who also had been picked up as I had in florida, and we all were driven to mississippi.  I had gave my best effort, I had no money but I had just received my monthly food stamps that I had contributed in total to the household. I had got a job and worked for 2 days, but with no air conditioning in my room only it was impossible to work thinking of my dogs being in there while I'm working. He worked 2 jobs so I enjoyed the distance from him. When he would be home he would make remarks about his 200 dollar water bill or mention his Rent being due. When I would thank him for helping me find a person to buy weed from he would mention how no one ever saves his day in his defense. He would come look in the shower when I bathed, he forced the towel off and although not at first,  I did move away and say to stop, only to realize that I needed to repeat over for him to stop. As his daughter was in the living room I confided in her that I don't like being alone with her daddy later on after he left for work. Once time for her to return home, I declared I was also deciding to return to my home of domestic violence. He denied me a ride home and thought I wouldn't have an option,  luckily uber was within distance. After I left and informed him I left and the doors were locked, he began sending me media pictures of a notice for eviction for me being there. He said I had taken his dog leash, and was appalled when I didn't message him back to have something to say about eviction. I was there for 30 days but left before he had any eviction paper so it wasn't like I was aware of or expecting because he mentioned that he did pay his rent and they were coming to fix a leak.  They fixed a leak, he told them I was there to let them in while he was working, that his daughter and I were there.  So I didn't cause any attention to myself. My dogs didn't do damage. He has 2 very large dogs of his own. In my mind I was uncomfortable, but babysitting 24/7 was my contribution along with 300 dollars groceries. I paid for dog food as well and cleaning products that I cleaned with. I feel manipulated , I was vulnerable, I left my home to be treated like a maid. A nanny, a piece of trash all around. He kicked my dog in my presence and he expected as his right as it is his home. He did nothing for his daughter after groceries ran out, he slept all day and ignored her. When I told him to do better for her he threatened to hit me. And said because of his mental health, he doesn't need to be yelled at in his own home. Are there laws for women being offered help only to be manipulated or further abused , leading to the return to square 1?",

        "Text": "Anyone ever have any experiences where the actual narcissists use DARVO and slander your reputation to the point where people believe, you are the actual abuser /creep? \n\n Used to be friends with a girl, who tried to brainwash me into some weird side piece - relationship. They did this by  repeatedly pushing my boundaries, breadcrumbing, then love bombing. Getting weirdly flirty at times,  rubbing on my pants in weird ways, getting too close, way to close to my boundaries and personal space bubble. \n\nI askdd them about it, (since I only saw them as a friend and they made me uncomfortable) and got gaslit. They used the whole DARVO techniques to deny anything. Their response was something similar to \"wait you think I\"D BE INTO YOU\" said in a really condescending way. I'd like to point out, in hindsight thinking about all their shady behavior, and how they'd come crying to me about their current SO, this person was consciously, or unconsciously - grooming me to be some sort of back up plan, which is gross and disgusting the more I think about it. \n\nNo contact, but they went full slander campaign. People I barely knew refused to talk to me, no more acquaintances, my so - called friends just upped and refused to talk to me. It was isolating and depressing ASF.\n\nWhat messed me up is, it's like they knew how the system works, and used it to their advantage. They know that if women point a finger accusing a man, (esp POC men) that people due to implicit bias and internalized racism: people will typically believe the man is the abuser.\n\nThis situation f****d me in the head, man. The DARVO and slander was super effective, it destroyed my reputation. My confidence plummeted, and my ability on how I perceive people and their intentions has become warped. Ive become pretty nihilistic and I don't like that. I'm always questioning people's actions, or if there's any hidden agenda n shit behind what they say. \n\nIt's even effected my ability to even want to go out in public, and make new friends. I used to be an adventurous dude, who loves life and enjoys new experiences.\n\nI'm slowly getting better with this, since I understand what my issues is, but I was wondering if there are any dudes in this sub who've experienced this?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. \n\nTLDR: \nWhite narcissistic woman use DARVO and implicit racial bias to potray POC man as creep.

        "Text": "Hey, thanks for reading! This is something I’ve been struggling with for a while. \n\nMy main concern is I want to make this relationship better, but I’m not sure if it’s redeemable.\n\nIf I were to describe her it would be like my other half. \n\nWe instantly clicked and had so much in common. To our first cars, (same year same model) our birthdays (mine 12/5 hers 12/6) our personalities and interest and plans for the future were all so similar. It’s like we were one of the same and we had the same humor and got along so well.\nWe always had thought of each other as “soul mates” or kindred spirits.\n\nHowever, early on in our relationship I started to notice some problems. One of which being is that she was very self absorbed, to the point where she openly admitted to being a narcissist and she didn’t care because she knew she was “better then everyone else anyway”. Red flag. She openly told me she didn’t care about how others felt. Red flag. And (kind of personal) didn’t care about anything other than her own pleasure in the bedroom. Red flag.\n\n(Me, I’m the total opposite I’m a people pleaser and someone who usually puts myself down to raise other people. If you guys know well than you know this is a recipe for disaster.)\n\nAlthough I saw all these things in the beginning, I didn’t really care because I was in that early stage of being completely infatuated. Unfortunately I did find her talking down to me a lot, like a lot. \n\nAnytime I expressed emotion both good and bad. She always followed it with negativity or resentment. Always looking for a way to put me down. I would notice this but not say anything because I thought maybe she was having a bad day or something like that. (Unfortunately, it got to the point where she did it all the time.)\n\nI started to become exhausted and would start getting scared to tell her about my day in fear that she would make me feel worthless. No matter what I did and if it was a great day or a bad day. For example I got a promotion, she would follow it with resentment, maybe act pleased but her language and tone would change for the rest of the day. \n\nWhich became clear to me later that she couldn’t stand anything that challenged her “I’m the best person in the world” mentality.\n\nAnytime she became upset and I asked her if she was okay, she would snap at me and tell me to not ask her that because it would only make her more and more upset. I wasn’t used to this because in all my friendships and relationships I was used to open and clear communication, and although I would try my best to, I would be told I’m “stupid” or other plainly derogatory words that she knew would hurt me and shut me up, and these words got to me. \n\nGot to the point where if she was upset about something I learned not to ask because she would only get more angry with me.\n\nMy self confidence plummeted and I tried every single day to make her happy. (If that was buying her things or just not saying anything about myself trying to take her places like dates and things. She’s kinda materialistic, which isn’t always a bad thing but for narcissists it makes sense)\n\nI really started noticing how toxic and how deteriorating it was for my mental health. \n\nI feel exhausted and awful about myself everyday. It’s completely ruined my communication skills. (I’m unable to carry out simple conversations because I’m so used to hiding how I feel and being afraid of asking how they feel. I used to be able to navigate difficult conversations and then give advice to the other party and come to an agreement. Now it’s like the simplest conversations is like diffusing a bomb.)\n\nThe worst part is I know it’s bad but I want to fix it. This is a part of her, yes. \nBut there’s also the part that I love and the negative things do get magnified. But I want to make it work but I’m unsure how or IF that’s even possible. I don’t have anyone giving genuine advice, people usually just say “to break up” or “you’ll figure it out” which can be hard when I’m looking for another outside perspective.\n\nIf anyone knows if this can be resolved, or if it’s toxic and I should get out then please let me know. \n\nThank you again.\n",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, around four months ago I went through a break up with my boyfriend of three years and the way the break up happened and everything that followed really made me think a lot about the whole relationship and I realized that it definitely was not normal. I started to read a lot about narcissism, I already spoke with two therapists, one of them is focusing on it, but I still feel like maybe I’m the bad one and I’m still overthinking everything, so I thought that maybe I could try to ask or share here so other people could tell me if it really was a narcissistic relationship or I’m just making things up in my head.\n\nSo, the start of the relationship with the person, let’s call him Tom, was really fast – I had a boyfriend at that time when I met Tom, we started talking and so on, I started to cheat on my boyfriend with Tom, I met his whole family on a New Year’s Eve when we were not even officially dating, then I confessed to my boyfriend about it and we broke up and after like a week I started dating Tom. I moved in with him like after two months? He was telling my that I won’t have to pay the bills, he will take care of everything and so on. The first few months were amazing, we spent a lot of time, he was giving me compliments all the time, he treated me really well. But after like 4 months everything just went downhill.\n\nIt was a covid time, there were lockdowns and I didn’t go anywhere and I gained a little weight, and after few months he started telling that I’m fat and that he no longer finds me attractive, it really messed with my self-esteem and I believed him, even though I could see that yes, I gained a few kilos but I definitely wasn’t fat. Later he started to flirt with random girls when I was literally right next to him.\n\nOnce he was flirting with his girl “best friend” with whom he spent quite a lot of time sometimes, right in front of me, the next day I read his messaged with her (I had a massive trust issues) to know more details, I found out that some touching happened and I just interpreted it as cheating even though he was saying that flirting is not cheating and my trust issues gone even worse. I told him to remove her from his life, which he didn’t want to do, so I came up with a rule – he will inform me if he spends time with her. At first, he agreed, but he didn’t do it – he was spending time with her behind my back and according to him, he didn’t want to tell me because he knew I would ask questions or be mad so he just didn’t tell me. I always found out either by coincidence or he told me some days or weeks after.\n\nI have noticed that he would also treat me bad in front of his friends, often times he would completely ignore me and left me sit in the corner while having fun with them, he completely stopped spending time with me and if we did spend time together we would do things he wanted to do, he never talked to me after a fight and never tried to solve the problems, every time he would start to talk to me like no fight every happened and every problem was just swept under the rug. But I would always forgive him for everything but at the same time I was king of hoping that we could solve our problems someday. I was always to one trying to solve our problems and save our relationship.\n\nLater I left for a study abroad for five months. Before that I was asking him if he’ll come visit me and he was always like “I don’t know, I’ll see how it goes in work, I don’t know about the money” and so on, but eventually, when I was already abroad for like a month, he told me that some days ago he was again with that girl best friend, which just meant for me that he doesn’t care about my trust and I just lost it, I stopped talking to him, we had some fights and I was just hoping that he would realize that he messed up and he would start value the relationship.\n\nAfter I came back, he picked me up on the airport, everything was suddenly very nice again, but that lasted for only two weeks. He told me about this friend from his work that he started talking to, let’s call her Sara, and my trust issues hit and I read his messages again. We had a fight, he wanted to break up with me for not trusting him, but eventually we stayed together. I convinced him to work on it – I will solve my trust issues but he has to help me, he will start communicate more and we will spend more time together and so on. He then told me that we will go on a ball together and attend his friend’s wedding and everything was nice.\n\nBut after like a month, he broke up with me kind of out of nowhere. He blamed me for the breakup, he sent me a text when we were both at home saying that I hurt him when I left for five months and that we don’t have anything in common and that he wants to break up with me.\n\nFew weeks after the breakup we were discussing finances, he told me that I can leave some of my stuff at his place and that he will pay me for it and I told him that I want half of the money for the bed we bought together. During this period I asked him few times about if the was flirting with girls when I was away, and for some reason he asked me if Sara wrote to me. He didn’t tell me why she would write to me and I wanted to know, so I wrote to Sara. She told me that at work there are some rumors about Tom (for example that he was telling everyone that I am an ex) and she also told me that they are getting to know each other and so on and she doesn’t know if she should trust him because of these rumors and she wanted to ask me how he was treating me in the relationship. So I told her everything and eventually she told me that he cheated on my when I was away – he told Sara that he confessed to me and that I forgave him, which wasn’t true. I confronted him about it, he said it’s true and that he just wanted to look better in front of her.\n\nI moved back with my mom, during a few months I was able to take all my stuff, eventually, we agreed that he will send me money for the bed and other stuff after I give him the keys. But, when I gave him the keys, he told me that he will not give me any money, he accused me of trying to ruin what he has with Sara, he blamed me for everything, he even used everything he did for me against me (him paying for all the bills for example) and he just treated me like shit.\n\nEventually, he gave me some of the money, after I told his mom about it. Sara is still seeing him and I don’t understand how can she trust him like that when she knows everything, even the fight regarding the money.\n\nSo, I don’t know, am I the bad one? Were my trust issues or the study abroad the main problems? I know that I should have not read his messages, that is something that I have problem with. We were together for three years and I just don’t understand how he could treat me like this, he literally just cut me out of his life like I never mattered to him.",

I’m looking for a job, and for me success is getting a good job. The market isn’t very good right now, and I’m trying to get a good job in the place where she is in. As much as I got advice on moving away from that place, I cannot detach myself from getting a job there. As much as I try I start crying and I get pain in my chest.

        "Text": "I miss him but am I delusional? Is this abuse or just a selfish partner?\n\nI’m reading all these posts trying to figure out if my ex was a narcissist or was I being unreasonable? I’m trying to understand what’s happening. Truthfully I’m so confused. It feels so extreme to say/think he’s a narcissist. As a grown woman, I feel so stupid for not being able to understand whats going on. I love him so much & although he wasn’t good to me, I crave him so badly. I know I deserve better but I love this man. I just want him to be better. \n\nHe used to initiate thought provoking conversations, always seems curious about life, encouraged me to be curious about things. Has a life coach, mentors people, involved with community, successful job, everyone loves him, sociable, kind. He lives a fun life, has a big friendship group, always goes to nice places, private  members clubs, fancy restaurants.\nWhereas I’m more introverted, often feel quite lonely, small friend group, I have a good job (nurse) but it’s emotionally draining & I barely want to do anything if I’m working.  \n He often made me feel boring for not having plans (my friendship group have all settled down & have different priorities, his are all younger & work in hospitality).\n\nHe is out all the time late at night for his job. I was so insecure & untrusting of this relationship after he cheated. He had a ONS & a 10month emotional relationship over text which ended in a physical betrayal when this woman came to visit - transatlantic flight). \nI know I drove him mad - every time he went out, it would get to 2am & I’d suddenly spiral. I would panic he wouldn’t come home, panicked about who he was with. Id call him multiple times, then text him excessively & break up with him because id be met with radio silence. I voiced my fears & told him I needed some communication on nights out (I asked for 1 message to be sent on a night out so I’d know where he was). He rarely was consistent with this, I asked him to not be out all night & to follow through with his promises when we were reconciling. He continued to be out all hours or just didn’t come home. I’d threaten to kick him out of our house when he did this but always backed down & just had to accept what he told me. He always argued that his mates GFs were fine with them staying out & why couldn’t I just trust him? We would have blazing rows but always managed to not walk out. We always needed to have a conversation but I was scared to rock the boat or he was too tired to have one. I didn’t want to sacrifice the possibility of a good day with him. \n\nBut the doubts ate me alive. He said he wanted to rebuild the trust but he continued to behave like an ass & blamed me for not being able to forget it & he said he couldn’t live with it constantly being thrown in his face. \nWe barely spent any time together. He’d have all these fun nights out with friends/work but if we did anything we’d be home in bed asleep by 10pm, saying he was tired. I’ve found cocaine in his bag. Drink, drugs, women. \nHis childhood was fucked up, his father SA is sister, absent mother due to mental health.\n\nI pointed out there was little effort, we no longer did things together. He was very adamant he wanted us to have our own independence & I argued that we were so independent that there was no point in being together. Every weekend I’d get excited to spend time with him, only to be disappointed when he told me he wanted time with his friends. 3 days together in 2 months at the end of the relationship. We lived together, so he viewed getting ready for bed or getting ready for work as quality time together. I’d maybe see him 1 night a week for dinner, he’d cook but sat on the sofa eating with his back turned to me or on his phone. \nHe’d lie in bed texting late at night & due to the texting affair, I was triggered & he’d get mad when I asked who he was texting. I know I was full on with my insecurities but I wasn’t being unreasonable, given his actions was I? \n\nNow we’ve split up, i’m wondering was I the problem, was I too much or is he gaslighting me? Why am I missing him so much? He left without a word a week ago. Moved his belongings out whilst I was working & left a note. We’ve exchanged two texts & he’s been very clear he doesn’t want to try again. I know I should be relieved but all I want is for him to come back. Am I messed up for feeling this way. I can’t eat or sleep & he’s out there living his best life down the pub with his mates. ☹️Feeling so broken ",

What is regular abuse? There’s multiple types of abuse, that’s obvious! Narcissistic people abuse others in very unique ways that are inherently caused by NPD, and having a term for that is useful! It’s not saying everyone with NPD is abusive, like how sexual abuse doesn’t mean all sex is abusive, or parental abuse doesn’t mean all parents are abusive. That’s just kinda stupid, right? Things can be defined without making it a whole deal, and it’s like, I don’t even know why this is such a big deal! If someone was abused why are we not supporting them and instead are nitpicking what they call their abuse! That’s stupid, right??? It makes me feel like what I went through just doesn’t matter, and that sucks- because I really thought it mattered, at least to me.",

She used group chats to manipulate peer groups and push me out of our peer group. She told lies and gross exaggerations of the truth to get others to go along with me no longer being invited to things. \n\nWorst of all, I can’t seem to get away from her. I grew up with her and settled in a place far away from where we grew up. After she graduated college she moved to the same town I was in and just down the street. About five years after she moved here I realized she was not right. She seems to find ways to get to know everyone I associate with or am friends with. It’s exhausting, as I feel like I can’t get away from her and all I want are some relationships that are independent of her. One summer she found out I was playing sand volleyball and she looked up my volleyball schedule and came to my games and weirdly introduced herself to some of my teammates. Has anyone else confronted this, and how do you handle it? I’m constantly paranoid and feel like I have to be overly nice to everyone bc I don’t know what she is saying to people.  For the past couple of years I’ve kept telling myself that people will see her true colors, but I’m tired. Every time I make a new friend she seems to rear her face. ",

We got along really well, almost too well, but never met in person due to her or I leaving the site. We found eachother last year via social media and well,  we started talking back and forth several months. I noticed she was being flirty right off the bat, and a little over lovey dovey and praising me with affection over texts, if was as if she knew the right words to pierce me right in my heart and make me feel good. I normally don't fall for stuff like this, but she got to me somehow and even made me believe \"maybe i should date again\". We finally met around fall last year.\n\nFirst meet was fine, we had great convo, dinner and she mentioned how attracted she was to me. Second time we met, she got physically intimate with me outside the bar and then kissed me before we went home(she also asked to borrow my vest, which she still has). She was still there with texting frequently just as she was when we reunited. But then....Third meet, we had drinks which eventually turned into sex(she initiated, even mentioned the L word doing it).......Then things changed. I had told her after to let me know when she got home, she said she would but she went totally cold after that night for 3 days. Talked to me for a bit, then went cold for nearly a week(only sent a couple memes but no actual convo).\n\nI confronted her about it, and she said she was sorry she just thought I didn't care about her cause maybe she was bad at sex?(Seemed like she prided herself on this) I reassured her that I did care and still want to see where things go. She was happy about it. Then she went back to text/love bombing me(saying how shes glad to meet a good man for once) for a day and being very responsive. Then yesterday, left me at my last DM when I asked her to let me know when shes free to hang out again. She took nearly a whole day to get back to me(she was still posting stories), which wasn't even a yes or no, just a \"like\" on my message. It's all ironic since on the day I confronted her, she said she was all about communication....  \nAnd thats where I am at now. What do some of you here think about this situation? I appreciate any help. It's really starting to destroy me mentally.\n\nPossible Red Flags?  \nLove bombing me.  \nShe still has yet to give me back my vest. She brought it the third time, but still wanted to hold onto it.  \nNotice loves it a little too much when I compliment her or tell her shes sexy. Like as its fuel.  \nShe has sexy selfie picture of herself as her phone lock screen.  \nHas hundreds of guy followers on her social media page. Even likes their semi sexual comments on her photos.  \nPosts very provocative memes/photos of herself.",

Our connection felt like nothing I've ever experienced before and after only a couple months he wanted me to move in. I originally wanted to wait at least 6 months before moving in together but I thought he was serious about us... He had given me a promise ring which he told this story that it was his mom's old ring and he'd been waiting to give it to \"the one\". He wanted me to wear it but I wanted a real proposal first. He was telling everything how in love with me he was and how he was going to make me an engagement ring with his grandmother's diamonds. So of course I got rid of my apartment, bought a car, and moved out to the suburbs to be with him. Things were still going great (I thought) but slowly he started to accuse more and more of things I wasn't doing... The first time was when I was away for a week to look after my sick father and I stopped to see my childhood friend on the way home. I spent the night there but they live in the middle of nowhere and I don't know anyone else but her and her boyfriend. The next day as I'm driving (9 hours) home to my boyfriend, he calls me accusing me of turning off my location and cheating on him that night. I tried to explain that I would never do that and my location probably wasn't working because I had no service... He never believed me and never let me live this down. Another time, a guy messaged me on insta and I explained I had a bf but my ex was upset by that and kept trying to tell me I didn't handle it good enough. Another time we were at a party and a guy came up to talk to me (for about 5mins) and he spent weeks bullying me and gaslighting me by saying that we were talking for an hour alone in the corner and I was FLIRTING with him. These felt like super outrageous accusations because there were 5 other people in that room (including him) and I made a point to talk about him as my bf... The final thing was when he thought I was talking to a guy but she was actually a girl (with a boys name). He never bothered to check her Instagram or he would have seen that. I am also positive I had talked about this girl before but he used this as excuse to check out of the relationship...\n\nAt this point, I was away for a work conference for 4 days and he was beyond paranoid I was going to cheat on him at work. He accused me again of turning off my location again. I was so paranoid of doing any activities or talking to anybody at work I couldn't even leave my hotel room... Ironically, that first night I was away, he stops answering me for a few hours and I check and see his location was actually turned off (in the same neighborhood he used to live in with his ex). I confronted him about it but he denied it and I let it go.\n\nOver the next few weeks, he progressively got more distant and aggressive. He was starting fights over nothing and screaming at me. Once I called him out on his behaviour and he got more at me and screamed at me to get out of the house and proceeded to hit the wall.\n\nAt this point, he was a total different person than the man I fell in love with. He quit his job and never got a new one. He would come to bed at 4am every night and wake me up (and be upset with me that I was grumpy in the middle of the night). And he spent his days smoking weed, vaping nonstop, and playing games on his phone.\n\nThere was one night I woke up at 3am and he wasn't home. I checked his location and he had returned to a fundraising walk (that ran all night) that we attended earlier that night. We had gone to a couple of these fundraising events as his mom ran them for her foundation... I thought it was weird he did this since he admitted he never even attended this event other years let alone go all night.\n\n... Fast forward a couple of weeks, he asks to turn off our location. I agree because I felt like it was causing problems and I wanted to build trust organically... 2 days later, he is gone all day \"for a haircut\" and when I asked him how it takes all day for a haircut, he screamed at me and started re-accusing me of everything he had already accused me of from the last weeks (as he did in every argument)... It all felt very suspicious because he just asked to turn off his location the other day. I remembered that his app for his BMW records all the trips he does and since I didnt remember the login on my phone, I asked him to show me on his app where he really was because he was clearly lying. He kept saying he would but would change the topic and avoid it. I decided to let it go as it wasn't worth any more fighting since we were arguing a lot lately. Within an hour he tells me he's going to a boys night to play poker all night. I tell him I don't feel comfortable with it since we just had an argument and I'd rather resolve things first, but off he went anyways.\n\n5 minutes after he leaves, I get an email saying I've been removed from the BMW app. At this point I KNOW there is something going on. I call him and he says he can't talk cause \"the boys are waiting for him\". I go to bed and wake up the next morning to him not home and a text from him at 1am saying he was spending the night... He doesn't return home till 1pm the next day.\n\nAt this point I'm anxiety ridden because I know he has been lying and I wanted answers. All he says is that he wants to break up with me... So I leave and go to my friend's house. I find out from her that she had heard he actually called his ex that day I was away at work. She also tells me about his past (because her boyfriend grew up with my ex) and apparently he used to see multiple women in the same day. And once he even showed my friend a girl's nudes that he was seeing before me. I had also known at the beginning of the relationship that he got a girl pregnant last year but he told me that this hike just really wanted a baby and came from a lot of money so didn't want any man to help her raise the kid.... But now I realize that maybe she just didn't want anything to do with my ex.\n\nSo after finding out the he actually called his ex, I message his ex to get some answers cause I don't believe anything he has told me (and I know who she is because he talked about her all the time). She actually calls me and says that they saw each other that day (but \"nothing happened\"). At this point I am raging because I KNEW he saw his ex that day and he gaslight me when I originally confronted him and he was saying \"idk what games you think I am playing or what boys you've dated in the past but I'm serious about and would never do that\"....\n\nSo I drive back to the house. He is getting all dressed up to go out and I confront him him about everything I've learned. He finally admits (after hours) that he did see his ex that day, and saw another girl \"friend\" the previous day when he was gone all day getting a \"haircut\"... And finally after pushing him to show me the trips from his car, he finally admitted that he actually went to a hotel the day before and the \"boys night/ poker night\" was a lie.\n\nSo I left. I went to my brother's and the next day he comes with me to the house to move my stuff out. When we get there, all my stuff is in bags at the front door. And we had barely even left the house and this other woman showed up!!!!\n\nHe wouldn't tell me who she was and kept changing his story. He kept saying I had met her before... He spent weeks playing with my mind. I finally figured it out (and he admitted it was true) and I remembered where I had met her before -- she was an employee of his mom (who I had met at those fundraising events). And this other woman was married with kids!!! This all started to make sense because I had caught them flirting at the first event and my ex gaslight me soooo bad. He even went to introduce me to her husband to \"reassure me\" nothing was going on because they were married. This was also the reason he went back to the fundraising walk all night (to be with her). It's been exactly 3 weeks since he cheated and I moved out... and the last I had heard she left her husband and is now in an official relationship with my ex.\n\nI also found out from his ex (when we spoke) that he had cheated on her at least 6-7 times that she knew of. And that during one of their arguments, he got so mad he threw his phone at the wall and it got stuck in the wall.\n\n.... I just feel so utterly destroyed and confused like I can't tell if he is a good person and this was just a bad situation or if everything I have learned about him is true and he's the monster that I saw in the end. Because how can someone go from loving someone so much and telling everyone they were \"the one\" to doing all this?! And the way he lied and cheated for weeks KILLS me. I feel like I've gone completely crazy with all his mind games and cruelty. Like cheating is one thing.... But cheating with a married woman (with kids) who is an employee/ friend of his mom and gaslighting me for weeks and telling me I'm crazy every time I felt something was off?!?!\n\nA part of me wishes they end up together cause they deserve each other. But the other part of me wishes he ends up alone and all his friends and family (who are convinced by his lies) all see who he really is and I hope he dies alone.",

Does he know he's lying? He has a history of mild stalking (his words) with a previous partner but in my case he stands staring when I drive by, driving erratically (hard quick turns, once he did a u-turn right next to me while I was walking) to get out of sight, and also stopping and staring. This is a tiny town. I live here. I confronted him and in the middle of a stream of squirrelly lies, he said the title: \"That doesn't sound like something I would do.\" Cue head explosion. \n\nI'm glad I talked to him because it's confirmation something is seriously wrong with him. But wtf. His story has been that I'm stalking him. Was it really projection? Will the lying ever stop?\n\nThanks for letting me rant. I know it's vulnerable narcissism. Just baffled. Okay, back to NC.",

I've been happy, and my mental has been better. \n\nMy ex and I have a mutual friend who sees his and his girlfriend's posts online. She told me that my ex had been taking his girlfriend on dates and an expensive trip. She also said my ex seemed to have proposed to his girlfriend. She has a photo of him holding her hand after he gave her the ring and this is one her profile. There is nothing on his profile. He has never posted her. \"Seemed\" because my friend said it could also be a promise ring. \n\nI told her to tell him congratulations. He messaged me to delete everything between us as I might message his girlfriend/fiance about those receipts. He tried to ask me to be his f***k buddy while he was with her, saying that they agreed to an open relationship. \n\nThat time, he told me he had no plans of getting married anytime soon because \"no one is getting half of his shit\". Then he contradicted this by saying, \"Marriage is a combination of assets\" when he found out that I got engaged with my current bf, and we're thinking of getting married, and we'll have a prenup. Now I've realized he might have told me this in attempt to break my relationship. I told him I didn't want to do anything with him because he accused me of blackmailing him to get him back when he already had a gf. I refuse to be gaslighted. I didn't deserve what he put me through. \n\nMy fiance is amazing. I've never imagined I'm capable of being loved, respected, supported, and heard. He's been my best friend for the longest time, and knowing I have cancer, he said he doesn't want to waste time. He's been taking me to my appointments and have been holding my hand on this journey ever since. \n\nKnowing he might have gotten engaged, my initial reaction was, \"and so?\". But that evening, memories and trauma of him telling me otherwise gave me a panic attack. It's all coming back. The feeling of not being enough. The lies. The feeling of \"I am the one who deserve respect and love he's giving her since he kept telling me I am the reason he changed to a better man after I almost died\". I don't know anymore. I want to vomit. I'm mad, sad, and confused, but I still want to be genuinely happy for him.\n\nIs this still a trauma bond? My fiance doesn't deserve all of these. Should I leave him? Should I live the rest of my life alone instead? I'm so lost right now. ",

Only reaches out to hoover me mainly. Rarely keeps it just about our child.\n* We split in September 2023. I caught him cheating. The girl reached out from his phone (snooping). Said there were other girls too but think she only reached out to me.\n* Girl didn't leave him. Thought they broke up in January but it was short. Last I heard they broke up \"for good\" in May. He's single as far as I know and she's already engaged to another guy.\n\nSince September 2023 she has stalked and harassed me. For some reason it's still going on even though she's not with my nex anymore. The most recent drama with her occurred on July 4th/Independence Day and not only that but my nex reached out as well extremely drunk claiming \"he wants his family back\" so I feel both of them reaching out to me is connected in some way.\n\nI have blocked multiple pages I have suspected her to be using since that's usually how she reaches out. And I've been told by people that have her on social media she still says posting stuff directed towards me. She's the type to add everyone so there are mutuals between us but I doubt they're the ones telling her anything about me because they don't personally know her.\n\nDoes anyone know why she would continue to do still harass me and stalk me if my nex and her are broken up and apparently \"she's found the one\" with her new guy?\n\nI suspect maybe they're still talking but I honestly don't know. It wouldn't surprise me if my nex lied to her and claimed we got back together or some made-up story like that.",

        "Text": "I was disillusioned with men sometime in early 2019, I had just finalized my divorce and had been dating somewhat, but I was not intentional or careful with who I dated. I was desperate and lonely for a while because I was not well mentally and was just taking whatever attention I could get, I suppose. \n\nMy ex came along, he took me out on one date and he immediately started lovebombing me. He tried to build tension by almost, but not kissing me, that first night. There is a word for it in Spanish, my ex was \"empalagozo(sp?),\" meaning, he was like,.. overwhelming (to the point of clinginess) with his declarations. I had met with him 2 or 3 times within the first 2 weeks of knowing each other. And I decided to cut it off cus i felt like I did not want a relationship (MY GUT FEELING). Well one time when I was at work, I showed one of his text messages to my coworker, she read it through and her reaction was \" Oh my god, that sounds so cute, it sounds like he could be the one\" and her comment made me doubt myself!! We are fed this stupid fairy tale princess narrative, that we mistake love-bombing with \"good deeds\" and with a \"finally, a good guy!\" All of which is fake, fake fake. It was all a persona. \n\nAt 3 months, his behavior changed with me. And of course I did not like it anymore. But everyone around me was so \"happy\" for me because I \"finally found a nice guy\" and his new behavior, well I had to rationalize it. It couldn't possibly be that he doesn't care about me anymore, he says he is depressed and well, that must be it, I can help him feel better. I am going to be a good gf and do what is right... which turned into 2 years of him bread-crumbing me, of him \\*cheating on me while I was pregnant with his daughter\\*, of him lying to me about EVERYTHING, of him pulling absolutely none of his weight, of him putting in no emotional effort or any effort of any sort into the relationship. \n\nIt wasn't until my daughter was born, and I had postpartum depression, that I realized he was just never going to do anything about anything. He was perfectly content with being the perpetual victim -the ppl at his job were always the problem, not him, his family was the problem, not him, the other drivers on the road were the problem, not him, his depression was just soo so bad, but once he got a better job, he will be better- ALL while I was nursing a newborn BY MYSELF, HIM OUT THERE JUST CHEATING (I kinda knew but again, I gave him excuses and the benefit of the doubt)\n\nMy daughter was my only motivation at that point, because I didn't even love him. I just had a stupid co-dependent situation going on. I knew being depressed while postpartum is potentially very dangerous, and can slow down the cognitive development of my daughter. I took the initiative of getting talk therapy and seeing if I needed psychiatric help. He did nothing about his \"DEPRESSION,\" he just left ALL DUTIES up to me. I finally broke up with him and he went AWOL. Haven't heard from him and it's been almost 3.5 years since I broke up with him.\n\nHe already had another girlfriend by the time we broke up. IDK but I doubt they are still together. He seemed to have used her. He never broke my spirit. BUT, all of it could have been avoided IF I TOOK THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW HIM FIRST BEFORE I FELL FOR HIS LOVE-BOMBING.",

I couldn’t even see properly, I was doing things “out of control”. \n\nShe texted me again last month, but because I’m aware about narcissism, with the help of my family and friends, I just deleted the text. \n\nBut I’d be lying, if I say if I don’t check up on her. I lost my job because of her. I cannot make decisions, I get stuck. I get panic attacks and fall on the floor, quite literally, from time to time. I left the city where she is, but inside my head I want to get a job back in the same city, because of an internal dialogue, where I need help from you guys (I’ve seen many of you helping out other survivors and I’d greatly appreciate help with this please!): \n\nGetting a job in the city where she’s in is extremely hard for me, because I need the visa and I don’t know the language. However, I did Masters in the city she’s in, and one of the most important ways I try to get over her is by telling myself that I’ll get a job there. However, it’s been almost a year; and I’m still unemployed. My career advisor told me, I need to gain some experience in my home country, as companies are not willing to sponsor Visa for entry level candidates. \n\nI tried to apply in my home country; but because of the strong internal dialogue inside my head, it’s like she wins and I loose if I get a job in my home country. \n\nI’m stuck, and I get depressed because of this. I used to get therapy and that’s how I knew more about narcissism, and getting over her. From standing outside her building to deleting her texts was a long way thanks to therapy, friends, and family. But now I can’t afford therapy as I don’t have a job, and I’d greatly appreciate how can I untangle this. \n\nIn my head, I’d only be successful or “win” in some sense, if I get a job in the city where she’s in (it’s not just that of course, her city is amazing, it’s a beauty of place). All my classmates got jobs and it’s just me who hasn’t, fortunately their head isn’t as tangled as mine. \n\nI’d greatly appreciate any input. \n\n",

He was highly verbally abusive, and emotionally abusive. He was very volatile also. He had hit me one time. He was very blunt and harsh with his words. He used to blame others for his behaviour and told me that his mother made him the way he is as he caught her cheating on his father and mistreated him during his childhood and he didn’t get the nurturing and support of his mother.

He used to pick fights with me publicly  and called me a whore in front of all his friends. He also maligning my image behind my back. He also killed a girl while he was high in a hit and run case. He used to tell me that i should feel special that he touched me as now i will become lucky 😒 Before me, parents of two of his exes had visited his home to complaint about him to his parents, as he mistreated both of them. \nAfter being with me for 3 years, he tied the knot with a girl in an arranged marriage setting, and told me that he is sorry as he was high on drugs throughout these years , and played with with my feelings because he was doing drugs.

He told me that she called him a narcissist and that she was controlling and was probably cheating on him, but now I'm feeling like the controlling one because he's an addict and I'm constantly suspicious of him, going through his wallet and checking the usual stash-spots for any signs of drug use. I'm turning into her. He said that she gained a lot of weight with him, and I gained 50lbs with him. He's always been suspicious of me cheating and now that I've gained weight, he doesn't accuse me anymore. So I'm just wondering if I should reach out to her? She seems like the petty type and not someone who would keep it to herself. And it also feels like a MASSIVE boundary violation and I don't want to act in a toxic way.

And wishing you each the strength we all need to overcome this type of abuse. \n\nThis time three years ago, I was arranging and paying for a wedding all by myself for someone who told me I should consider taking off my engagement ring around his ex wife because that would be upsetting to her. \n\nThis week three years ago I got in a huge argument with my husband to be about his online activities on gaming platforms and messaging/sending money to young women. I was told our wedding could be cancelled because “he wasn’t sure who I was.” (F$&@ing ridiculous projection in hindsight)\n\nThis day three years ago I started having dreams  every single night where said ex wife would tell me I don’t know what I don’t know about him. \n\nWhat I didn’t know until after we were married was that he had multiple affairs, was a compulsive liar, and would engage in, what was to me, the most terrifyingly threatening behavior. …like locking himself in our room and threatening self harm, or trying to throw himself out of a moving car on the freeway, or screaming at me to the point he lost his voice or being so physically threatening and scary, my 100 lb GSD would cower in the corner.\n\nToday I get to be here. Alone. Healing. Working on getting better. Surrounded with purpose, love and healing on the Sanctuary. \n\nFor every single person that has messaged me, provided their feedback and talked through their own experiences or otherwise engaged in a meaningful conversation with me about what happened…\n\nThank you. \n\nI know those conversations can be awkward, even tense, and for some of you, very activating from your own experiences. \n\nDomestic violence happens in secret. \n\nBeing seen is so, so important.

        "Text": "I (F29) think my dad’s ex wife is a narcissist due to several traits I’ve noticed in her behavior: \n\n1. She took my water bottle without asking for permission while I was abroad. She thought messaging me was too difficult but she messaged me on my birthday so I don’t get what she is talking about. She cleaned my room but she never does it for me and always messes around with my stuff. She cleaned my room before taking the water bottle and I think she did it as an excuse to ‘borrow’ it\n\n2. My dad’s dog had to be put down recently and I was with my dad at the vets. I was crying like a baby while holding the dog and when I got back home my dad’s ex wife called me and blamed me for never doing enough for his dog despite always being there cuddling and teaching him tricks. She was also upset about the fact that I needed a break in my room because it was a very emotional moment and I’m autistic so I need time to calm down. And then she was acting lovey dovey about it but she never apologized for her behavior\n\n3. She also recently demanded that I helped packing her stuff because she was leaving and she wanted to go before it started raining. But then she changed her mind and decided to stay. When I confronted her about it she said she doesn’t remember saying that she needs to go back home before it was raining and “maybe she meant the sun” because the weather changed\n\n4. She always wants to interfere and do things her way when she is visiting my brother and my dad. And she always blames me for being lazy despite trying my best to help my dad \n\nShe has always behaved this way and I can’t get rid of her entirely because she is my big brother’s mother. Are these signs of narcissistic abuse?",

        "Text": "For years all I can remember is my father being angry or responsive. I'm turning 15 and November and began realizing things which I see as 'normal' but to my friends is weird. My Dad has really bad anger management issues and is known to explode randomly if something is not in place. I have anxiety making life generals bad but it doesn't help that he can say some mean things. It was around 2 weeks ago when I was having a bad day and we were going to see a family friend however I was having a panic attack because I was scared to go out and really wanted to stay home. He got winy saying : \"Why don't you come with us? (Name) would love to see you, how are you going to keep doing this?\" basically making me feel like the problem, I explained saying I was really not feeling it and how I was struggling as well as seeing people and big crowds was an issue. However my mum jumped on backing him up(She does this every time even if he's in the wrong).She begged me until he both forced me. On the way here I was hyperventilating and sobbing as well as telling them multiple times I wasn't comfortable and I wanted to go home.While we were in the MCDonalds parking lot he snapped saying that now we(my family) were never going to have any holiday, birthday or dinner anymore because of me basically.Keep in mind at the time I was being home schooled because of my anxiety getting worse and after his even I got worse because everyone was watching us.\n\nAlso, I can remember him ruining other events or things of mine I loved such as Easter. I loved the idea of gaining chocolate from his bunny. I was so far back now I can remember how it happened and why but he ended up snapping and telling me that the Easter bunny, Santa etc doesn't exist and it was all fake blah blah blah.I sucks even more knowing I was so excited,I made a letter and much more for the bunny. I have IBS and he often gets mad if I can walk our dogs because of chronic pain(I cannot take medication because of my age as well as since I just doesn't work for me🤷). He yells at me and tells me its my job and I'm being dramatic(He has IBS as well so he knows what it is like).\n\nHe's ruined much for 'fun' experiences for me and then apologized and says he won't do it again(SPOLIER: He does it again, again again!!) I'm generally uncomfortable around him and enjoy time when it is just me, my brother, his fiance and my mum.I know my brother sees i as well since he moved to another area of England with his fiance and her parents. I also act so different around him, when I'm with other people I'm more opened up and I feel like I can act like myself bu when I'm around him I have no clue why but I put on a fake persona(Which shares similar views, ideas etc to him). Sorry it's long- I'm sooo desperate to know if it is him or just me D: ",

        "Text": "I have learned over the past couple of years that when we come out and finally voice the abuse we have endured, one of the first questions asked, especially in the legal system, is this: “If it was that bad, why did you stay?” I wonder if these sometimes even well-meaning people know how damaging and heavy this question is. It seems like a simple logical question, but NOTHING ABOUT BEING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT INVOLVES HEAVY MANIPULATION AND GASLIGHTING, IS LOGICAL OR SIMPLE.\n\nPeople might imagine that the terrible incidents we finally talk about happened suddenly, right at the beginning of a relationship when we are still strong, have a sense of who we are, and are not affected by the cognitive dissonance that is so common in these situations. The truth is, most of the time, the progression of abuse happens more gradually, more like the frog in the boiling pot situation. It is even more complicated than that and not the same for every survivor. No matter what the circumstances, it is not simple, and it is not logical.\n\nSurvivors are not stupid. Some can even be highly educated, very smart, and even high-level professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and ironically, as in my case, mental health professionals. The manipulation, lying, and gaslighting followed by nice gestures and love bombing take away from your sense of “how bad things really are.” Many of us do not tell anyone what we are going through, which makes it as if we are almost living in two different realities, one public and another that becomes more and more our private hell hidden and therefore easier to compartmentalize.\n\nNo matter how long it takes for a survivor to finally stop living that double life, here is another issue we are afraid of: Are we going to be believed? “What will happen if I talk?”\n\nIronically, this is the main part of my story as a survivor of abuse. Once I started to finally have the courage to face the abuse, to even admit to myself first that I was abused and finally say it out loud, the people and systems that were supposed to support and protect me and my children failed us. One by one, at every step, they failed. A “couple’s therapist” was the very first person I ever talked to about the abuse. I will never forget that day. I was in couples therapy with my ex, and the suppressed memories of the worst parts of the abuse were surfacing for me. I finally gathered all the courage I had, worked through the shame I was feeling, and told him in a session, “This is really, really hard to talk about, but he actually slapped me once some years ago. When I was lying down and crying, he…” Something was not letting me say it. Was it shame? Was it pain? Or was it that I knew once I said it out loud there was no going back? It would become forever real, and I could never deny it to myself again. I knew instinctively I could not hold back anymore. I was a mental health professional for god’s sake and knew there would be no healing unless the wound was exposed and talked about, so I tried to continue, “He stood on my head.”\n\nSomething bizarre was happening in that moment. It was as if I was both the teller of the event and the listener for the first time. It took my breath away. I was the victim feeling the pain, but I also had another point of view. I was hearing it out loud for the first time and was shocked. How could I be shocked? It was as if someone else was telling me this horrific thing that happened to them. As the victim, I was feeling shame. Why was I feeling shame? I just could not bring myself to see that “I was that woman,” “the victim,” as I always identified as a strong, independent woman. The worlds were colliding, my identity shifting and changing. I finally took a deep breath and had an idea that somehow gave me a sense of power back. It was a spark of an idea that took all the shame and gave it to its rightful owner. I said, “You know what, why do I have to tell that story?” He is the one who did it. I want him to say what he did, and not gloss over it, to actually say everything he did. My head was not lowered anymore. I looked in his eyes. “Go ahead,” and the shame was transported to him. His face became flushed and red. With encouragement from the therapist, he described, stumbling over words and obviously uncomfortable, that he stood on my head and kicked and jumped on my head while I was lying down.\n\nIn that moment and since then, when I say this story, I get the same look, the same reaction from everyone. The very first reaction is not that of empathy, disgust, or anything like that. Instead, it is pure and utter confusion, like not being sure if they heard things right. And I understand why. “He stood on your head? And jumped?” It is such bizarre behavior that the bizarreness and abnormality of it take precedence over the violence and how we feel when we hear about violence. I can see they are almost in disbelief or trying to imagine how or why anyone would do that. There is something different about this scenario than, let's say, someone punching you, kicking you, hitting you, or maybe even stabbing you. These are horrible and horrific acts, but we are all familiar with them. We have seen them in movies at least, or in real life, or heard of them. But a man getting up and standing with both feet on a woman’s head while supporting himself by holding on to the back of the bed and then jumping on her head? I wonder how many people have heard anything like that. Besides the violence, there is something very sick, incomprehensible to most people, and almost psychopathic about that.\n\nThen came the failure. I had finally gotten through the hardest part. The secret was out. Okay, now what? I looked over at the therapist. Honestly, I think he had no idea how to deal with domestic violence, let alone something this bizarre. What happened next is almost a blur. I think he asked us how we each felt about it or something along those lines. The session ended. This was never brought up again, at least not in any meaningful way that I would remember.\n\nTo be honest, I needed to know that this was as bad as I felt it was, especially now that I had voiced it. I needed a reaction. I needed something more than “How do you feel about this?” as if he had just yelled at me a little bit. I did not talk about this again for a few years after that. The therapist failed. The interaction left me feeling more confused. Was I making too big a deal of this based on how it was dealt with?\n\nTo this day, I am thankful, though, for the idea of having him recall and tell what happened. This is one of the only incidents he cannot and has not completely denied or minimized since. I think he is worried about a witness who can ruin his identity and false narratives.",

He started insisting that I guarantee we would be in a relationship because otherwise I was leading him on. He kept saying how I wouldn't let myself be happy, and that he could make me happy. He kept telling me I was afraid and I shouldn't be. But I felt all the panic and nervousness. Everything about this guy was setting off my alarm bells.\n\nI haven't felt like I could trust my gut in a long time. I called my mom. I spoke to a trusted friend and the cousin who saw me through my divorce. All 3 agreed that my anxiety over this guy was justified.\n\nI ended it. He tried to bait me into an argument by saying, \"So I was right\" after he panic-texted for almost an hour after I'd asked for space. I didn't respond. I didn't feel the need to defend myself.\n\nI feel proud of myself. But I am also scared that these will be the only men I attract for the rest of my life.",

        "Text": "I am shaking, feeling trapped once again. He is standing in front of my car. The locked gate is behind me, and I am trapped. He is filming me. Why is HE FILMING ME? Mila is crying in the back seat, and when I look back, It breaks my heart to see the fear on her face. She has to go to the bathroom. I look at him, I look at her. He seems calm enough right now, filming me, just not letting me leave. Confused, scared, and unsure, I ask Mila, \"Do you want to go to Dad’s place to use the bathroom?\" Her eyes widen with fear, and she says, \"No, I’m scared. I’m not getting out of the car, but I really, really have to go pee. Can we go home please? I want to go home\"\n\nEmotions run through me like a storm: heartbreak, sadness, the need to protect her from this experience, and then anger. I roll down the window and shout, \"Mila needs to go to the bathroom. She is not getting out of the car.\" He continues filming, something he has been doing for months now. I did not yet know he was trying to \"trap me\" into doing something he could film and use against me. I am thinking only of Mila. Emotions churn within me: fear, heartbreak, the need to protect, and anger. I yell, \"She is not getting out of the car. Let us go!\" He does not move. Mila is crying hysterically. She pleads, \"Mom, can you just hit him and go? Please?\"\n\nI feel like a trapped wild animal. I am so angry now, but I have to control myself to avoid scaring Mila even more. But I need to do something to make him let us go. I am shaking, hyperventilating. I look at Mila. Every cell in my body wants to protect her. I want to get out of the car, push him over, and take my child to safety. Thinking back, perhaps that is exactly what he wanted. I finally say, \"I am going to call the police if you don’t let us go.\" Although I know this could scare Mila too, I decide that, amidst hyperventilating and shaking, it is the least damaging solution.\n\nI have been here before. He has trapped me in a car, in a room, and he has done much worse things to me physically, emotionally, and verbally. I have never called the cops on him. This time Mila is with me, and I have literally no other choice. I call, half out of my mind with all the emotions. They answer, and I explain that the father of my children grabbed me when I was checking on my daughter because he took her from school without a plan after months of refusing to see the kids, and my daughter wanted to leave. He is standing in front of my car. It’s been at least 15 minutes. The dispatcher says, \"Do what you need to do to be safe. Officers are on the way.\"\n\nHe is still filming, saying, \"I have the right to see my children too. You cannot do this.\" It is as if he is a character in his own movie that he is filming. He knows this has nothing to do with the kids and everything to do with me. He has sworn to \"destroy me,\" to \"take everything away from me,\" to \"put me in my place.\" He knows. I know. At this point, unfortunately, I think even the kids know. They have cried when he refused to see them unless they agreed to the new schedule he suddenly demanded to have more time with his new girlfriend, without compromise, not caring that I had to readjust everything. The kids are also not ready for that. They have asked me, \"Why does Dad hate you so much?\" They know too. So this is his movie he is creating, where he stars as the loving, involved father prevented from seeing his children by his ex. He knows, I know, even the kids know how many times I have tried, even begged him to see the kids, to not do this to them. In his movie, though, the story is different.\n\nThe police finally show up. Two white men come out, and before even checking on us, they go to him. What happens next is one of the most traumatizing events of my life, and I have been through a lot. I almost gasp for air. In front of my wide eyes, he suddenly collapses on the ground, CRYING! It’s like time freezes. I Was less scared when he grabbed me yelled at me pushed me or entrapped me because i was watching right in front of the reality being warped and changing. The cops literally cuddle him, soothe him, and talk to him empathetically for almost 15 minutes before they even check on me, the person who called for help. My brain is racing. It’s over, I already know. I have seen him play the charming, even shy, gentle guy role where no one would beilive the things he had done to me even if I told them, but this, this is the performance of his life. He is showing them parts of the video he took before the grabbing and entrapment, portraying himself as just being with his kidd during “his time as routine”  when I arrived there for no reason, twisting reality is what he is best at. He is not telling them that he has refused to see the kids for months, taken their property hostage as a tool for schedule negotiation, that he just picked up mila with a 1 minute notice with no warning and blocked me from calling him to check on her.I don’t know what else he is saying or showing, but I see their faces, three men almost bonding. I know when the officer starts coming around after I finally call out to them that they have already made up their minds. One of them approaches my car. His face tells me everything.\n\nI start explaining what happened, still hyperventilating. I say, \"He grabbed me.\" He says, \"No, he did not.\" I can tell he already made up his mind, but to say so matter-of-factly, \"No, he did not?\" I lose it. This is happening in front of my five-year-old daughter. She saw her dad grab me, she was scared, and she saw him not letting us leave. She saw me call for help, and she is watching as he says, \"No, he did not.\" I am livid, and I say in an accusatory voice, \"What? How can you say that? You were not even there.\" He says he saw the video Ray showed him. I ask, \"Did you see him come toward me?\" He mumbles. I say, \"Do you think he would make sure to film while he is grabbing me?\" I don’t remember much after that, just that he said, \"He has the right to his kids.\" He asks Mila where she wants to go, to which Mila says, \"I want to go home, with my mom.\" They tell me I can go. I am so shaken, and I ask for a report. At first, he refuses, then he gives me an \"incident number.\" The fact that he took us hostage, filmed even by him, is not even addressed. I just want to go and take myself and my daughter to safety.\n\nAs I drive by, what I see is burnt into my brain forever. I see him bring his head up as he is standing very friendly with the officer, going over some papers, and he looks at me. The expression on his face tears my insides. He has a smirk, a gleeful face that tells me everything. It tells me that he is in control, that he \"won,\" that even here, just like in Iran, I have no rights when abused. The one time I called the police on him, I ended up regretting it.\n\nThe rest of the day is a blur. Calming Mila down, trying to answer her questions. Ray calls and talks to the kids. He sounds cheerful. I have not heard him be this cheerful for a long time. He makes sure to tell Mila, when she asks why he did what he did, \"This was not my fault, honey. Even the police agreed with me.\"\n\nI have no words for how I am feeling. Rage, perhaps, but a rage that comes from being bullied, stomped over, and laughed at. But even more so, rage at seeing the confusion on Mila's face as she is gaslit at five years old by her own father. She tells me, \"But Mom, I saw him grab you. Why did the police believe him? I don't like the police.\" By now, I am used to managing extreme emotions inside while controlling their expression so I can take care of and protect the kids. I am at a loss for words this time. This time it is not just him; this time, I am terrified that my daughter is having to choose between her own experience and what two authorities are telling her is the truth—not only her dad but the police, the people she is supposed to trust and go to if she is in trouble. I have no answers myself.\n\nI feel violated. I am not sure why I feel this way, but it reminds me of my past traumas in Iran. Every time I dared to voice abuse, even sexual abuse by a stranger on the street, I was told I was the problem—that either I was lying or caused the behavior somehow. I am being eaten alive from inside.\n\nAfter the kids go to sleep, I cannot take it anymore. I need to take my \"power\" back. I call the police station and ask for the report. Something inside me tells me that I cannot trust that report and that I need to see it. I am right. In the report, there is no mention of him grabbing or entrapping me. Instead, it says in black and white: \"Female was the aggressor.\" I can just see his face as I read that—the smirk, \"I am in control. I will destroy you. You are nothing. You are trash. I will put you in your place,\" things he had said to me verbally but never hurt as much as this.\n\nI feel like the pain and rage inside of me will actually make me physically explode. How could this happen? I am shocked, but it is more than that. This event traumatizes me and proves to ultimately have a catastrophic effect on my life both mentally and literally. I feel like, in one day, I am suddenly transported back to Iran, feeling just as powerless, worthless, rightless, and caged. I gave up my whole life and moved here at twenty years old for nothing else but to have rights, freedom, and not be legally abused, belittled, and stepped on by men. Now I am not sure if it was all for nothing. Feeling powerless just like living in Iran, but I remind myself I am not there, I have rights. I go to the police station the next day asking to talk to the sheriff after telling them what my complain is about the sherrif reviews the evidence, including the videos he included and said “ that is wrong, they should not have put you down as the aggressor” a glimmer of hope. I ask well how do we fix this to which he replies “we cannot” “once a report is written it cannot be changed. I am confused, how is this ok? I called for help, they put me down as the aggressor. I tried to explain that he now can and will use this against me as we are in the beginning of a custody case. “I am sorry I cannot change that” I ask for instructions to make acomplaint. They give me a number and a form for internal affairs. I did not know that then, but this was the beginning of hell on earth for me. A ball of snow rolling down the hill that within a year would become an avalanche and would destry my life and take me to my knees. Looking back I am at awe of just how naïve I was as I truly belived justice and truth will prevale if one only “does the right things”",

Trying to just give basics but will be happy to answer questions.\n\nBackground: Last month I planned a trip for me and my two kids to do an overnight at a hotel. At the time my boyfriend and I were going through a rough patch. I didn't tell him about the trip at the time because I planned it to be just me and my kids because it was more expensive to add him and his son, it didnt fall on his custody day, I wanted to do something just me and my kids and with all the fighting we had been doing it seemed like it might add fuel to the fire.\n\nMy mistake was not telling boyfriend right away. I meant to tell him, it wasn't a planned secret. We just keep butting heads lately and then honestly I just forgot to tell him. Last week boyfriend brought up having us all go to the same hotel. Second mistake was I didn't tell him we already had plans to go to that hotel next month. My fault because this would have been perfect opportunity. Instead I was fearful of making him upset that I already had plans so I made excuses (which were truthful concerns) we had no one to watch the dog, he pressures me to go on rides at the waterpark that I'm not comfortable with and it makes me really anxious. All were truthful but I guess not the full truth because I didn't mention our plans. \n\nFast forward to today and my kids mentioned we are going on overnight in a couple weeks. I immediately apologized and admitted that I had planned the trip a few weeks ago and I should have mentioned it and not kept it from him. I said I was sorry and what I did was not malicious or mean spirited but I felt awful he found out like that. I apologized genuinely and took accountability.\n\nHere's the issue. He is saying that he 100% can't trust me anymore and that this is along the same line as cheating. Says he can't believe anything that I've ever said to him. Yelled at me. Accused me of purposely excluding him and his son. Said I lied about the reasons I didn't want to go, with him and his son because I knew I was already going ect. He went to bed early and he isn't speaking to me. I get that I should have told him earlier and I made a mistake but is this really a lie you would lose all trust over?\n\nThanks for listening. With abuse sometimes the world doesn't make sense and I don't know if what I did was as bad as he is making it out to be.",

Their lack of compassion shields them from ever truly caring or understanding you, and your emotional needs can never be met by a narcissist. \n\nSo not only has my X pwNPD tried out her recycleship over and over again,\n\nShe had the audacity to flex like she is some kind of rare precious thing I lost. \n\nLosing a narcissist is painful, but it is a net gain.\n\nWith patience it will be revealed that the new or recycled supply will be disrespected, narc’d, and abandoned just like you were. \n\nShe thought she could do better with me.\n\nShe didn’t. She couldn’t.\n\nAnd she won’t do any better by anyone else in the future. ",

There was one day we were having a good day and she started crying telling me she messed up, I asked why, she said she took the Tylenol in the cupboard, I ask her how many ready to take her to the hospital because I know how bad those those people go, and she said she took five whole Tylenol, I told her she’s fine and ended up holding her for a while.",

        "Text": "I'm 23, my bf is 32 (red flag, I know, but as we can all probably relate to, it was a whirlwind romance at the beginning and now, here we are lol)\n\nSo we've been together for about two years with about a three month break up in the middle. We originally broke up because he was abusing drugs, which I thought was the reason for his actions. Now, he's beginning to do drugs again. He started about 6 months ago, the first two times were in the span of about 3 months, and he promised that he would stop, but now it's weekly with him gaslighting me by saying \"I don't hurt you, I don't beat you, I make money, I support you, etc... So what's the problem if I do this once in a while to treat myself? I promise I'll stop. I'll get tired of this eventually, but just trust me and let it run its course.\"\n\nAll of the times I have caught him doing drugs, he's always flabbergasted and asks if I have a wire on him, or if I'm tracking his phone or insists that there's someone that I'm talking to who's putting these ideas into my head as though I'm not smart enough to know when he's high or when he's bought drugs. As though he's not incredibly predictable and incredibly easy to read. It's extremely patronizing.\n\nHe is the type of person to say that he doesn't want to tell me the truth because he doesn't want to hurt me. But then he'll turn around and say hurtful things or say things like \"you're very naïve and easily manipulated\". He says that he wants me to know so that I don't get hurt by people who would take advantage of me.\n\nThe issue is that we live together and I could get by financially (albeit struggle somewhat) without him, but I'm afraid of the breakup itself. The last time it was incredibly traumatic with him saying things that have stuck deeply with me even so many months later. Comments about my body that he knew were points of insecurity for me but then recanted when I took him back and insisted that he only said them in anger during the breakup. Constant negging in very \"innocent\" ways by pointing out insecurities and saying he finds them cute, for example. The breakup took about a week before he finally left and stopped appearing in my apartment when I'd get home from work. Then he got kicked out of his friend's place and I took him back in temporarily until he found a new apartment and then we got back together. And now things are bad again. I thought he'd changed, I thought the drugs were the issue. But now I'm starting to think it's him.\n\nI'm trying to find an apartment but I can't afford anything more expensive and everything in my area is overpriced, not pet friendly and out of my budget. \n\nHe lives with me, my name is on the lease, but I just want him to leave. Are there ways that I can get him to leave me? Is there any way that I can get him to break up with me? I've been in that cycle of trying to do \"all the right things\", and things only got worse. I tried agreeing with him when he would gaslight me, knowing full well I was being gaslit, that seemed to spur on his anger and meanness, and just drag on the discussions way longer than necessary. So I've gone back to not taking his crap, calling him out, etc.. we haven't had intimacy in many weeks as well. Is there a point where he'll get tired of me? Do I need to wait it out? \n\nHe's threatened to leave me twice in the last few months because I got upset at him for taking drugs again. He said that he didn't want to be nagged about it. At the time, I said no to breaking up, because the context around the threats were volatile enough that I knew, if I said yes, that it would explode into what happened last year and I just can't go through that again. It was horrific. He was high and drunk, and would somehow get into my apartment while I was at work and just stay there for hours crying?? It was the worst experience of my life. Is there anything I can do to avoid that again? It was a scary experience filled with drugs, and alcohol, and yelling, and name calling, and hours of making me feel worthless, stupid and just terrible. I was graystoning the whole time and he was saying anything and everything to get me to break. Insulting me, my body, my friends, my family, just everything he could think of. And stupidly, I decided to take him back because I felt bad for him and convinced myself it was all because of the addiction.\n\nEverything was good for the almost 6 months of his sobriety. And then everything started going downhill again. Now I'm just done. I want to go back to school and I want to move forward in my life, but I've done nothing but stagnate with him. And it hurts to know that this is what it's come to, but I just can't keep going like this. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nSorry for the rambling. It's my first time talking about this and I'm just trying to make sense of things while still asking the questions.",

        "Text": "Have you ever asked yourself “why did the this narc pick me? Why am I a narc magnet?” \n\nIf you’re anything like me, you had low self esteem or self worth when you met the narcissist. \n\nWhen I met my X pwNPD, I was very broken. I was suffering from burnout because I spent ten years working the night shift, weekends, and at least 100 hours a pay period. I had separated from my husband and was going through a divorce. I had a falling out with my narcissistic father and one of my cousins that I called my “sister cousin.”\n\nI was tired and broken. I came back to my hometown from Spain where I was trying to rejuvenate. Then I met the woman who would change the trajectory of my life. \n\nShe very quickly started making requests in hind sight. It started with something innocuous like what restaurants she should go to since she wasn’t from there but was working in my hometown temporarily. \n\nThen it progressed into planning vacations and where we’d meet up since I went back to Spain. Then within 3 months, it was to help her navigate the home buying process. \n\nAs I look at how I contributed to where I am in my life, I realize that I have a codependency problem. I like being a problem solver. My role as a nurturer and a caretaker is a part of my identity and my self esteem hinges on how much servitude I give to the people I love. I’m resistant to the impatient, because I am extremely patient. When people explode or I am upset, I usually remain calm and try to provide a solution, and I get a rush and a smile when I help others out. \n\nIf you’re here on this sub, we probably share at least some of this. \n\nWhat I want to share with my online healing community is that while these traits are good, and wanting to help others is good, allowing it to be tied to your esteem in yourself is bad. \n\nI’ve been listening to the work of Dr Kerry McAvoy and she said something I will carry with me forever. \n\nShe said: \n\n“Giving away your trust is bad”\n\n🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯\n\nShe went on to explain that trusting people that haven’t earned it is dangerous, and believing people and not asking questions is as well. Simply because it leaves you vulnerable to both good and bad people. \n\nNarcissists seek out people their trauma dumps work on because they know if you buy it, you’re a codependent. If you honor their requests and respond to their triangulation by trying to top their X, that’s a marker that you’re a codependent. \n\nIn the same way that narcissists have hallmarks and a cycle, so too does a codependent. \n\nWhen you give people your immediate trust, when you buy the shared fantasy following a trauma dump within a month, when you scramble to please the narcissist no matter how big of an asshole they are to you, \n\nThey know they’ve secured the codependent that makes for a good supply. \n\nThe narcissist cannot survive without codependency. The narcissist must have a willing servant they can manipulate with minimal effort. \n\nIf you race to anticipate the narcissists’ needs because it makes YOU feel good and you haven’t explored why, \n\nYou can rest assured you’ll be taken advantage of by another narcissist or toxic person in the future. \n\nOr maybe you’ll find yourself hoovered and back in the bondage of the narcissist. \n\nIf you go no contact with your nex and you stick to it, \n\nYou’ll likely be the only person who has ever done it to them. \n\nI recommend reading “Codependent No More” by Melodie Beattie if you’re at a loss on how you can begin addressing this within yourself. \n\n7 months ago,  a Redditor recommended it to me. \n\nThen I had to admit that I am a codependent. I lost control of my own life and derived my happiness from providing energy and service to an emotional vampire. 🧛‍♀️ \n\nThat’s like a tasty delicious snack for a narc. \n\nWhat’s funny is I was able to identify that my X pwNPD’s “best friend” is supplying her with codependent energy and getting jealous of it…\n\nNot realizing I was doing the same damn thing!

I know the things I did when I was with him are NOT who I am at my core. I know this because I simply haven't done bat sh*t crazy things since we broke up.

But I still cannot deny that 1) I never acted this way before him 2) I stopped acting this way after him.\n\nThings like texting him ~60 times in a row, emailing him ~60 times in a row if he blocked me at one point, saying the worst possible things about his dead mother whom he didn't have a good relationship with, saying the most unhinged things about my miscarriage (threatening to show him photos), hooking up with his best friend when we were broken up for 9 months, harassing his new girlfriend on social media and telling her about my MC.\n\nCan anyone relate?

        "Text": "I am planning on leaving soon, but I would like to vent and hear your experiences.\n\nTL;DR - Yesterday my boyfriend was first nice, then treated me progressively worse as times went on, and today went the same. He was sweet at first, and is getting progressively worse and more controlling and angry. What are your experiences with this?\n\nYesterday was my boyfriend’s birthday. The day started well, although he was going back more and more on what he said he wanted to do. First he said “I want a chill day, no internet, no working, just gaming and relaxing” which eventually turned into a whole day of looking at games online, and then things went rapidly downhill. We did an update on our computers and some features stopped working. Nothing that would be an immediate problem, but he then said “I don’t want to sleep until this is fixed” which means we don’t sleep because he will keep talking and freaking out. And this was after 11pm already.\n\nAfter about 3 hours I started getting a headache which progressed into a throbbing head and neck ache. Now, what happened next is further made worse by the fact that he keeps saying “taking care is most important!” and insists I immediately drop whatever I am doing and take care of him when he has even the slightest pain or papercut. He started asking “Do you want to go to bed?” and I said yes and did lay down for a bit but he kept talking and then insisted I get up to help fix the issue. This was at around 5am. I took an ibuprofen in secret because I knew this would take longer, he obviously didn’t care, and he is against pain medication, saying “People should just take care and not be weak by taking pain medication. I don’t need them, my pain tolerance is very high” (que him screaming and crying because he hit his heel on a table leg). Another hour later and it was done and we were heading to bed while he was complaining that I didn’t look stressed about the computer issues and it felt like I was diving us and that it was sending a message that his feelings are invalid.\n\nToday he woke up and did a few minutes of cleaning and he made a box for my stuff and wrote my name on it and was acting sweet and caring, asking if I was feeling better, how's my head, etc., and I thought “Oh, here we go again. He is being sweet and I could actually forgive him for not caring at all yesterday.”\n\nAnd then a couple of hours later he started acting controlling, telling me to stop using my keyboards because the sounds annoy him (I switched to an on-screen keyboard now); I asked him a question and he completely ignored me; We were setting up a new game to play together and he told me to click something in the settings, I did so and it did something he didn’t expect and he got mad at me for doing what he said. When I told him “Why are you mad? I did exactly what you said, no?” and he said “Yes, but you’re excited and it makes me mad. You get hyper and move faster. Can you just manage your excitement?” and he also said \"It looks like you really like this game and it makes me feel bad because I'm not sure how I feel about it.\"\n\nSuffice to say, I don’t think I am in danger of forgiving him. I just can’t wait to leave.\n\nFor everyone who left, I hope your healing journey is going well.\n\nFor those who are still in these situations, hang on. You’re strong, and you’re not alone.\n\nWishing everyone all the best and sending you love and strength!",

It took me awhile for me to realize what I was dealing with was a covert narcissist. I used to think “oh it’s cuz he’s in his active addiction” and would shrug it off. I had 3 years clean and sober and recently relapsed with him but it was my fault for hanging out with him knowing he was in his active addiction. The night I used with him I found out he was texting another girl some sexual things, he sat there and said “it’s someone to talk to” and I said “you have me wtf” he said “well it gets lonely” I felt that there was something wrong with me and still kinda do. We went no contact 40 days ago. Now I’m counting my days again and have over a month clean and sober and taking it one day at a time, I’m learning that they juggle supply. I keep thinking that it’s my fault and that I wasn’t good enough for him that’s why he’s seeing what else is out there. He told me to move on once again and I definitely have to move on because we used together. I had a trauma bond with him and the first few weeks of not talking I was struggling with an urge to reach out to him but kept telling myself “there’s no point” some friends say he will be back but I don’t know how he would come back from that and I definitely don’t want him in my life again. I just thought I’d share because it’s weighing so heavy on my mind and catch myself crying here and there. Thanks for letting me vent ",

        "Text": "I think my ex may be a narcissist. \nFor so many reasons. \n\n- he can't seem to be able to keep friends for a long time. he would always talk about this friend and that friend and how they weren't close anymore due to some bickering.\n\n- He sold his apartment and moved in with me to go for a second year at an art school, selling his apartment was the only way he could afford it.  And...Then dumped me six months later. \nI did everything at home, everything. All the laundry. All the cooking. All the cleaning. Everything. And I couldn't ask for help because then I \"compared him to abusive men\" and if I started crying from exhaustion he claimed I was fake crying to manipulate him.\n\n‐ he didn't break up with me, he just moved out and ghosted me. One day he comes home and says that he is moving into the dorm at his school (which he wouldn't do before because it is expensive and he has no income). And then he is gone. Wouldn't reply to my texts or my phone calls. Just ghosted. \nWe were a couple for 2 years.\n\n- I paid for everything all the time. Whenever I brought up that I'd appreciate us splitting more expenses (like the rent, electricity, food, internet) he would just brush it off.\n\n- he cheated on me with a girl from his school. I suspected it but I didn't want to seem crazy. I just feel so fucking gaslit cuz I'd ask him what was wrong, why he didn't want to hang out with me any more, why he suddenly changed his mind about me visiting him at school... they are still together now (as far as I know).\n\n- He uses people. I don't even think he understands that does. \n\nHe has one close friend that I know of, and he was talking so much shit about her during our relationship. He basically called her whiny and basic and stopped answering her calls, a couple of times I spoke to her on the phone because he wouldn't. Before him and I were a couple they used to hang out a lot. She'd drive him around in her car whenever he needed to go somewhere. \nI encouraged him to hang out with her because I guess I felt kind of guilty that they didn't hang out as much when we were a couple. But I guess he had me and my mom to drive him around and fix things for him. \nAnd when he moved out of my apartment he asked her to carry things and give him a ride to his new dorm room.  She texted me a few months ago and apologised to me, telling me that she had no idea that he was moving out with the intention of ghosting me. \n\n- he left all of his stuff in my apartment including his dirty laundry after he discarded me and made no effort in picking it up until a month ago. \nHe also refused to return my keys. I have no idea why. For six months I had to deal with his stuff being in my attic.\n\n- he made out with his new gf right outside of my door (according to a friend of mine) when he came to pick up his stuff. \n\n- right before he came to pick up his stuff he started to ask me to pay for a bunch of things. like things we bought together, I said i'd rather give him the things instead of paying him for them and then he started to tell me that it was all thanks to him that I still have my cat. \nYou see, his mother gifted me my cat two years ago. I love my cat so much. I started crying when he brought her up as I was super afraid of losing her. \n\nWhen the day came for him to pick up his things he demanded a bunch of stuff that wasn't even his, and when I refused to give him that him and his mom tried to literally break in my apartment and take my cat? His mom literally screamed \"I want my expensive cat back\". Five of my friends had to literally body block her from getting into the apartment. \n\n- He has accused me for \"treating him like a monster\" post break up. I have gone no contact so I haven't treated him... well, at all. \n\nNow.... I am trying to heal. It's been a fair few months since the discard. I feel angry sometimes because I was treated so poorly, but I am just trying to move on. Somehow. \n",

The narcissist lack compassion. Most of them still have diminished or truncated versions of these emotions. \n\nThat’s why the narc is a fuqn stalker. \n\nMmmmhmm. That’s right. \n\nAs soon as you go no contact, the loss of control will hit that dusty weirdo like a ton of bricks. That is an emotional response, is it not?\n\nI ask them all the time online. \n\n“If you don’t care, and you never cared like you claim, why do you hoover? Why do you look at your X’s social media? Why can’t you go away with your new supply that you say is ‘better’ and be happy if you don’t care?”\n\nThey do care. They care deeply. It’s just from a self centered interest. Everything is about them. \n\nThe narcissist cares that they don’t have their desired access to you. If you’re in no contact, they can’t control the narrative and tell themselves how you still want them, you’re still vying for them. \n\nI still ruminate over the cruel words of my X pwNPD. “I used you to get over my X, I was never in love with you, but I’m in love now. I can’t stand to hear you talk, I’m not attracted to you, blah blah fuqn blah.” \n\nOh yeah? If you can’t stand to talk to me why can’t you stop looking? Why can’t you stop reading? Why are you hiding in my online wall like the horseflies in your raggedy house? You do an awful lot of paying attention for someone that doesn’t care, dontcha?\n\nThat’s what it’s like when you care. \n\nNarc cannot help itself because the narcs emotions are compelling it to hold on to the vestiges of whatever control is left. \n\nFor most people, that online stalking will turn into a hoover. \n\nThose are emotions. \n\nThe narcissist will tell you themselves they don’t care. They will delude themselves into trying to believe their own BS. \n\nAs their victim who has blocked them moves on with their lives, and the recycleship and/or manipulationship they monkey branched to begins to lose its luster, \n\nThat’s when YOU will become a louder voice in their head. \n\nThey will ignore it, until they can no longer. \n\n“Hey, you know, I’m sorry that you allowed yourself to be hurt by me. I didn’t realize how much I hurt you, and I can’t stop thinking about you.”\n\nThose fauxpologies usually go something like “sorry you messed up and sorry I got caught.” \n\nLet’s be clear. The stalking occurs when the narcissist loses control. Losing control sends their emotions into a tailspin. \n\nThe hoover is to regain control. \n\nOnce the narcissist successfully regains control,\n\nYou’ll be back in devaluation: faster than the first time. \n\nAnd if you let go, you’ll be stalked…\n\nThe cycle can continue indefinitely if you let it. \n\nThe final discard lies with you.",

        "Text": "Im so proud of myself. I read right through all the nicey-nice BS. He’s hovering and I have to play along until all my stuff is officially out of the house. I knew he was using the “let’s have the closure conversation” to get supply from me, so as soon as I had the courage to do it without struggling, I called him back. \n\nHim - So, like, are you ok, what are you doing with your time? \n\nBS DETECTION: \n*he’s prying for information. And hoping I’ll respond by asking him the same question so he can tell me that he went on a date. *i had zero jealousy, btw* \n\nAlso him - I  just want you to be ok - I just want you to be happy. \n\nBS DETECTION: \n*he doesn’t want “the community” to think he ruined me. He doesn’t want people saying, “She was once so lively, and vibrant and successful when she me him, now she’s a shell, homeless, living 1000 miles from her family”*\n\nBefore knowing about NPD, I would have heard that as - “awww, see, he is just a normal guy who genuinely wants the best for me. That guy has empathy. And with empathy, therapy can ‘fix’ his temper. That guy can’t be a monster. A monster would never wish the best for me. The monster must not be real…it must be me, I’m the crazy one, i have to accept his anger, and I must stop being a nudge…I have to get better.” \n\nAnd, well, fuck that. \n\nHe tried saying, in regard to abuse: “well, if that’s your experience, who am I to tell you that didn’t happen, even if that’s not how I experienced it.” \n\nBULLSHIT DETECTION: \n\n*oh, so he didn’t experience labeling what he did (violently narc rage) to me as abuse, but he did admit to violently screaming at me, on many occasions - he knows I have video/audio, so he can’t deny that it happened. Instead, he denied that it was abuse. *I just gets nervous sometimes, and your demands that I not yell, makes me feel more nervous, like I’m walking on eggshells* \n\nWhen I say I had ZERO desire to argue my point, I mean I had nothing. I only said, “well, you and I clearly have philosophical differences about what is and isn’t healthy in a relationship, and the good news is - there’s no law that says we have to agree” \n\nAnd, since he wanted to give advice on what he thinks is good for me for my future, I returned the favor and “advised” him that: — outside of his flying monkey’s circus, his “nervousness” is going to continue to show up with every woman he gets serious with — because every woman is going to want more from him, especially because he goes for independent women who have their financial shit together- he coerces them into the fantasy by exploiting an acute vulnerability because he’s capable of sniffing it out like a beagle can find bone that’s buried hundreds of miles underground.  \n\nHe was so calm, but also SO SO DUMB. That’s what I took away…hahaha…from the conversation. He still thinks exactly how he thought when we were together- like he had brain damage, like he was too stupid and nervous to behave like a grown up. He also had no plans to do anything positive for himself to make him more attractive to the type of woman he wants. Nope, he’ll wait for the vulnerable one, swoop in to save her, then ultimately destroy her because “Mommy” made him nervous. \n\nJust like the narcissist can spot vulnerability a million miles away, I’m learning to spot the narcissist abuser’s lies from even more miles away. I know I will always have to be one step ahead of him until he gets new supply, and even then, his fantasy could shift back to me. \n\nI’m not scared. \n\nI’m very proud of the impenetrable wall to the bullshit, that I’ve built. Im not impressed, nor do I care, care how nice they’re “dressed”. If they have shit on their shoe, shit that they’re dragging all over the house, and I tell them there’s shit on their shoe, there’s only one acceptable and appropriate response —1. clean it up; 2. apologize for stinking up the joint; and 3. promise to be more careful next time by remembering to check their shoes at the door. Short of that, I will forever hear every word that comes from their mouth from that moment on, as a bold face narcissistic lie.  \n\nWe all know exactly what the narcissist will say about the shit on their shoe: “I’m not touching that shit it because it’s not my shit, and even if it was, it’s not my fault that it’s on my shoe. It’s *ackshuaaly* technically your fault for making me nervous, and for making me walk funny. You’re actually an abuser for *pushing* me.”\n\nAnd just like that I’d be on my knees cleaning shit off HIS shoe. \n\nIt felt so great to not feel even a smidgen of empathy or compassion. I felt no need to pray for him, forgive him or even punish him. I don’t long for him (the addiction to the idealization). Nothing. \n\nI’m finally living under my own Sun, my own Moon, and my own Stars. I know wholeheartedly that everything that happens in the dark, eventually gets revealed in the light. \n\nIt’s my time to shine ✨ \n\nJust FYI. I do not recommend talking to them unless you absolutely positively have to. ",

Should I clear our names to him, outing what she said about him?",

        "Text": "Okay, this is a long one, I'm a 26yo female - I'll try to summarize as best as possible. I have been estranged from my father all my life because he walked out when I was a baby and didn't contact me until a few months ago, as he was having another baby (26 year gap!) I had to try and put the baggage/betrayal of him missing my whole life behind me and I was willing to do that. We had been building up a relationship (over a long distance) and things were going well, I could see lots of potential, he showed emotion and regret and truly seemed like he wanted to put things right. I had noticed some traits but put them to the back of my head. I so wanted to like him and make things work. We had a disagreement, small in nature but he blew it out of proportion saying I chastised him and berated him when I asked for an explanation and some accountability. He roared at me down the phone, sent a text message telling me to apologize and that the trip (26 hour flight) that we had booked to go and see him 6 weeks out, shouldn't go ahead because you guessed it - I am emotionally immature!!!\n\nWith that, followed a silence and his wife reached out over a couple of weeks. She rang me and told me that she was absolutely horrified with his actions, completely over reacted and showed a very nasty side, she was fearful he was capable of treating me, his daughter, like that and would do the same to their son. Over a few weeks of supportive phone calls, she started to confide to me and my husband on separate occasions what sort of man she was living with, his narcistic traits, his lack  \nof drive, his financial dependence, his bad parenting, etc. She said things to  \nus and we may have agreed on some things (i.e. the horrific way he can cut  \npeople out ) but we both tried to stay impartial and encouraged her to try and  \nwork things out with him. She had even moved out of their apartment because she  \nwas so angry. She queried whether she should pursue full custody of their child  \nand block him out. We advised her not to do this, that wasn't her call etc. and  \nagain, to work things out with him for the sake of their young child. The long  \ntrip we had booked to go and see them all was now just to see her & my  \nhalf-brother.\n\nWhilst we were on our travels, they rekindled and he conveyed his disappointment that she would meet  \nme without him. So as we land, after a 26 hour journey - I get a text message  \nbasically saying if you're not willing to meet your dad tomorrow, it puts me in  \nan awkward position - FAIR. I understand that, but he did call off the trip,  \nput me through hell for 6 weeks, I wasn't ready to meet him fresh off the plane  \nso I replied: No, I'm not open to that but I can chat to you about it in  \nperson. No reply for 36 hours or so and then I'm hit with this showstopper  \nmessage -  \nWishing you all the best in your life,  \nmarriage, future kids etc. but because you didn't reply to me for 24 hours ( a  \nlie, I replied 4 hours after landing!) and because you're not willing to meet  \nyour dad, I am signing off for the last time. We need to focus on our family  \nunit here. We were absolutely gobsmacked - we queried if she was being coerced  \nor in danger to which she assured us, she was not. Then, because she had gone  \nthrough such a personality and character transformation, and we noticed we were  \ngetting blocked on every platform (and knew she had divulged too much and her  \nonly way out was blocking us - my husband said 'can we have an open  \nconversation the 4 of us where we share what we've all been saying and  \ndiscussing about X' - mostly her!   \nShe said we were manipulating/bullying her and proceeded to block us. The next day I receive an email from my father telling me that his poor wife has been poisoned by us, we are toxic, he doesn't want anything to do with us, I have been taken away from his will etc. I try to mediate things somewhat and say that I'll meet him because it's not right to end things like this. He refuses.\n\nMy question is: Myself or my husband never outed his wife on all of the truly horrible things she said, and to reaffirm, we were not his biggest fans as you can imagine but we weren't saying cut throat things about him. We called him a narcissist but what she said, was so much more damning. Now, she broke our confidence and maliciously manipulated the entire thing back to us and how we poisoned her. But we never outed her and all the things she said. I believe the reason she blocked us, is because she didn't want this truth getting back to him. She wanted to paint us as the villains and he was gullible enough to believe it. He cut me out of his life based on lies his wife told about us, and truly, I did not really ever  \nutter a bad word about him, but he has cut me out of his life because 'all the  \ntoxic things' I've said. \n\nWe both hate to break our principles. The messages she sent us over the few months were confidential conversations and we never intended on sharing them but he has come back, again \\*victim\\* saying how awful we are and how we are the reason this has all ended.  \nIs it okay to break our principles in this case and share the things she said  \nabout him, potentially ending their relationship by doing so. I don't want a  \nrelationship with either of them again, but it feels wrong to go through life,  \nabandoned by your father and him thinking he has done so justifiably. I wish he  \nknew the full truth, even just for closure. The effects of this have been  \nabsolutely devastating, it has sent me into such a horrible place, I can't  \nbegin to describe the hurt and pain of being abandoned all over again. What do  \nyou think we should do?\n\n1. Given the summarized information I have provided, should I close this book and move on?  \nor   \n2. Leave it open so I can return to it at some point and maybe know him and my half brother in the future.  \nor   \n3. Tell him the truth that his partner outed him and she sabotaged us so he would never find out & clear our names.  \nMany thanks",

        "Text": "I just want you to know that you are a horrible human being. You are a terrible person.\n\nIt is the actions that determine who a person is. The sum of your actions is your character. The ideas and perceptions people have of your character is your legacy. \n\nYou are the worst kind of person. A leech, a mosquito, a parasite. Lacking in self awareness, lacking in the ability to evaluate others perceptions of you. \n\nYou are the worst kind of weak. You cave into primal desires because you lack discipline. You see nothing through. You’ve been allowed to fail up because you have succeeded in using other people and superimposing their success on your mediocrity. \n\nSure, tell yourself that I’m wrong. Retreat back into the circle in the world you’ve carefully crafted where everyone knows you’ll cut them off indefinitely.  \n\nYou aren’t the first to do this to me. Several people that I loved deeply have done it, because it works. I’m the kind of person it works on and so you used it so you could use me. \n\nYou do it to Stripperbitch. To your brother. To your cousin. To your mother. Minus your ‘girlfriend’ I felt the treble of fear in the people around you. I felt it when you did it to me. \n\nShe is your girlfriend, and you can never be hers. When she realizes this, she dissociates and abandons you. It keeps you in the loop. It keeps you trauma bonded. \n\nIt works on everyone, even you. \n\nIt taught me something though. I will never allow coercion through abandonment again. You like how your brother begs you to see your niece. You like how your cousin is terrified to lose you because it places you in the power seat. You like the precedent it sets. I’ve seen the haughtiness and the hubris you get from laughing at their pain, or the indifference. \n\nEarly on I flat out told you about my abandonment issues, and you exploited them. I’m more upset at myself for letting that out so early and for trusting someone I didn’t know. \n\nSo yeah, I talk about your shitty cologne from Zara (that shit stinks for real) and your ugly ass clothes. The real reason you suck at life is because of the way you treat others. The dynamics of your relationships are so terrible. I was literally going to the brink of insanity by September of last year. \n\nYou say I have no genuine friendships but I’d rather be alone than have any ‘friends’ like you. When I said I wanted to be friends it was because I was still trauma bonded. \n\nNow that I can evaluate the actual woman: small, ignorant, hedonistic, lacking principles, wandering scruples. Philosophies like “don’t speak on my relationships” are really just self insulation from criticism which is a healthy part of normal relationships for neurotypical people. \n\nIf I had known the real you I would have never fallen for that. You’re barely even human because you lack the emotional range people are supposed to have. \n\nThat’s why you can’t understand why someone who is meal prepping for you and making you dinner every night is upset when you bring a can of soup back when they are sick. \n\nYour relationships aren’t even transactional. They’re just one sided. It is the fear of losing you that has a psychological grip on those around you that paralyzes them from evaluation what they’re getting out of their relationship with you. \n\nYou simply take up space. You are an occupier. A colonizer. You show up on time for people, and stay late. But you don’t *bring* anything. You are incapable of offering emotional support. You don’t understand that you even need to do that. You can’t understand how your inadequacy is harmful to others.\n\nPaying for things is a transaction. Besides being a sponsor, what value do you add?\n\nYou and Yolanda can only evaluate the perceived value of relationships by how much of a power struggle is in them. Once someone actually loves you, and is actually available to you, you lose interest. Just like Yolanda with “M.” I couldn’t see at the time that you are just like that. She’s in love with you because you aren’t available to her. If you were, you’d be treated just like “M.”\n\nBecause you’re fucked up human beings who get thrill and the feeling of euphoria when you’re in pursuit of exploitation. You behave like a child that begs for toys and then cries for a new one once they have it and have played with it. \n\nSpiritual children. Emotional toddlers. Trapped in some really big bodies. One of them has permanent shoulder pads. \n\nWhat more do you bring? \n\nPlease understand. That’s why I don’t want you back. That’s why I never look at your social media, I don’t drive past your house even though it’s ten minutes away. I don’t come around, I don’t call or text, and you’ll never have to worry about me doing so. \n\nSo when I say “you ain’t shit,” this is what I mean. \n\nThere is literally nothing inside of you to offer. \n\nYou listened to me talk, you showed up in Paris and fucked me. That was the only time you ever satisfied me. I spent another year chasing the feeling of Paris.\n\nIt never came. \n\nYou paid a couple bills. \n\nMaybe for someone as damaged and lacking in education as Stripperbitch or Yolanda, that’s good enough. \n\nI’m going to tell you something else. The statement “nothing good ever comes from a (n word) named [insert your brothers name]” is a horrible lease on life and a horrible way to treat your flesh and blood who is trying to do better by you, who has more apologies and remorse in him than you could ever have in you.\n\nI really hate that energy for you, but apparently that’s what you like. \n\nFor me, that’s literally nothing. \n\nUnlike your brother, I will not be begging for you back. I will not be pining away for you like “The Big D” and I will not be ever open to listening to a fauxpology like Tee or Stripperbitch. I feel bad for them because the trauma keeps them apologizing to someone who is destroying THEM! \n\nI am no longer in the fog, and I am free. \n\nYour character is that you are nothing \n\nYour legacy will be that you destroyed women’s lives and treated them like the shit person you know you are on the inside.

I kept telling him I needed more time, and he got mad saying we’ve known each other for months now, how much time do you need? I felt shitty. Convinced myself that If I get intimate with him, our relationship will be fixed. I let him book that expensive place in the afternoon, the next day. \n\nI told him that I was not sure and that if things happen they happen, and I’m not entirely ready for anything, he seemed alright with it. But just in case things happen, please bring condoms I asked him, and he told me that’s fair, and that he would.\n\nAfter reaching the place, he got very aggressively touchy, and we’re both into things like that, yes, but I wanted our first time to be lovemaking and not fucking. And he went in me raw and I got scared, used my safeword, and he immediately stopped, asked me why. I told him I was not ready for unprotected sex, especially not the first time we got intimate, and he got upset. I had to sit down and talk him through all the disadvantages of unprotected sex, saying I didn’t want to wasn’t enough for him to stop sulking. He finally told me he understood, and promised that he wouldn’t ever try to go raw unless I asked for it myself.\n\nAfter cuddling for a bit, we got touchy again, and he went in raw again, I panicked, I asked him, condoms, we need condoms, he kept going, and didn’t stop, I used my safe word once, he didn’t stop, twice, he didn’t stop, thrice and he finally did. I ran away to a corner of the room, shaking and crying, he didn’t try to tell me he was sorry or anything. He stayed in his corner of the bed cursing that I was the first person he trusted to go raw with, but I didn’t trust him enough to take him raw. I felt so bad.\n\nFor a good ten minutes, I sat by myself, shivering. He didn’t make any attempt to console me or tell me he was sorry. Finally, I broke the silence and asked him why, he told me he got carried away and that he’s disappointed in himself for what he’s done. I told him it was okay, and asked him to take out the condoms that I’d asked him to bring, he told me he didn’t bring any. I was disappointed and asked him to order them online, and also maybe get something for us to eat since I was hungry( It was late in the evening, and hadn’t eaten since morning, which he knew, I kept exclaiming how hungry I was). \n\nI lay in bed with him, letting him just hold me in silence. I asked him why once again. Didn’t you tell me you’d never do it again if I didn’t ask for it again? Didn’t I use my safe word before too? How can I trust you now? \n\nHe pushed me away and stayed silent. The silence gave me so much anxiety, I just wanted to fix things and not cause any more drama. I came back to him apologising and telling him that I do trust him and that I understand he just got carried away. \n\nHe finally ordered them, (without any snacks for us, only condoms) and he went at it again, It was the most humiliating sex we’d ever had, he called me a slut, whore and whatnot, and I wasn’t enjoying it, not because I’m not into things like that, but because of what had just happened. But I wanted him to be happy, so I went along with it. In the end, he told me, babe, you just like dirty talk huh, maybe you’re not as kinky as you thought. In the moment I was like yeah maybe, but now it feels like I just didn’t feel safe enough to express any kink with him then. \n\nI even called my best friend and told her I finally got some D. It took me a few conversations with my friends to understand I’d been violated, and coerced and now I feel disgusted. I’m so anxious and unable to sleep, the worst part is, he’s gone back to ghosting me. He told me he was going to his parent’s place over the weekend( two days after we slept together for the first time), and he didn’t text me for more than 24 hours at a stretch or call me for 48+ hours, only to respond back today saying, sorry, my parents were sick, had to take care of them. \n\n",

        "Title": "How his behaviour changed over time",
        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "His tactics have changed over these 2 years since we started dating, and it makes things much more confusing. He used to drink and regardless whether he was drunk or not, he would fling insults, degrading comments, demands, threats, etc. at any time of day or night for any reason. He blamed it on his addiction and kept promising to quit and saying he needed me for it and I just stayed. He switched from supportive and kind to outright loud and abusive in a literal heartbeat. He switched from being thankful for any help to demanding help and kindness. It was so fast that I couldn’t wrap my head around it.\n\nHe did quit drinking (to this day claiming I did nothing to help or made it more difficult, while also saying he couldn’t do it without me) and he became less aggressive, but of course, this didn’t “cure” the abusiveness, since it isn’t the root cause. Being sober seems to have allowed him to think more clearly and be more calculated about how he abuses.\n\nWhile he was drinking, if I stood up to him and said that I didn’t like how he was treating me, he would threaten suicide or self-harm. After he quit, he would stop doing things that I said were unacceptable to me, especially when he saw that I was getting ready to leave. Now, he has mastered playing the victim, manipulating and gaslighting without yelling, creating lose-lose situations for me, and subtle name-calling, such as him saying “Stop acting like a b\\*tch. I’m not saying you are one, but if the way you’re acting now was who you are then yes, you would be a b\\*tch, but you’re not, right? That’s not you. You’re not a b\\*tch, right?”\n\nI also realized that he is able to talk about himself and his stuff for hours upon hours without any input from me. So I disengage from him more, grey rocking as much as possible, and that has caused less conflict, but it is in no way a functioning or respectful relationship.\n\nThis has created a situation where I am considered to be in the wrong for still carrying the weight, resentment, fear, and, frankly, traumas of the times when he was aggressive and giving ultimatums and threats, because he has changed his behaviour (though, if I mention trauma I am \"being dramatic\" and if I say he was threatening, he would say he was actually \"just saying what would be the consequences if I continue \"arguing\" with him, and it's just good communication that any good partner would do\"). And he uses the fact that he changed his behaviour as a weapon to back up how he is the bigger and better and more committed person. A couple of days ago he said:\"I'm tired of being the only person in the world who is actually working on himself and changing for the better.\" The change he asks/demands of me is, in his words:\"I'm not asking you to change who you are, just how you behave and think and your mindset...\" By the time we get to the end of the list there would be no trace of me left and we'd only be left with almost a clone of him. And he has confirmed he wants someone as much like him as possible, and from the beginning he saw me as someone like that. I refuse to comply with or commit to that.\n\nThank you for reading. This community has helped me make more sense of what is going on and what is being done to me. I am feeling much better and more confident about my feelings, boundries, and my decisions to protect myself and leave. You are wonderful and very brave people.",

        "Text": "So I had a friend in 2021-2022. Everything was fine up until a point. I had noticed they started to pull away from me, not respond to me as much or at all compared to responding to others in our circle. I've been treated like this for years, feeling excluded and left out and not ever knowing why.\n\nI had a vent account, and so I started to vent on it about how I felt left out. I wasn't specifically talking about anyone, just how I felt in general. This friend then messages me and asks if the vent was about them, and if it was they were sorry and they just weren't responding to many people other than their girlfriend. I said it was okay, and that I didn't expect a response all the time, I just felt bad because I wasn't getting one at all. They apologized for ghosting me and I thought it would be better from there. They continued to ghost me, however. And they weren't just responding to their girlfriend, it felt like it was everyone but me.\n\nI kept feeling this way because I was still getting treated this way. Not just by them, but by other friends too. So of course, because it was a private vent account, I kept venting.\n\nThis friend started to attack me for little things. Like for example, I expressed like for a character, and he tried to accuse me of liking a minor. The character was 20. I was 21 at the time. And other such underhanded things.\n\nIt all came to a head when I made a joke that made them uncomfortable. They confronted me, I apologized immediately, they said it was okay and just to avoid those kinds of jokes unless everyone else was also making them. And I thought that was the end of that.\n\nI saw that they posted on their vent account about me. They basically were saying how they tried to include me in everything but I never respond to it. That wasn't true, but I then went to him and apologized for still complaining that I was getting ignored. He then went off on me, saying how I was treating them like garbage, making them uncomfortable, and that I needed to go to therapy. I apologized, agreed to go to therapy, and begged them to keep being my friend.\n\nI started therapy (still in it) and I gave them their space other than to tell them I started therapy. I then left them alone. A month went by, and they still had been ignoring me. I felt like this was just the end, so I blocked them. And he started to tell others he actually dumped me because I made him uncomfortable multiple times, that I was pissy because he rejected me, and that I sexually harassed him. I tried to defend myself every time, but it only made the situation worse. His friends would come to me and tell me to let it go and move on, because they wanted to, but they would always start it by vaguely talking shit about me in front of me. And when I would respond, I'd get attacked.\n\nTo this day, they still are spreading lies and twisting the narrative about me. Is it even worth it to try and defend myself? Should I just leave it behind me and ignore them? Even now I'm scared they might find this post and send someone to confront me about it. I don't know what to do or how to move on and recover from this.",

        "Text": "By the end of this read you’ll see how a 25 M absolutely healthy boy, got completely paralyzed after narcissistic abuse. Please be aware of people! \n\nIf anyone’s got any advice, any message for me, please! I’m mentally & physically haunted. I never expected this! I don’t know how to approach this. \n\nI’m 26 M, and for the last 25 years of my life I’ve trained, lived healthy, and had a normal life. I’ve lived all my life in the Middle East, and last year I\nmoved to Madrid for my Masters, where everything changed! \n\nI met this girl. She was seeing someone, and I didn’t want it. She chased me and I gave it a shot. She is pretty. One step at a time-  she started separating my from my friends, she started taking me out to good places in Madrid, which I didn’t know of, and if I stayed home during the weekends, which I liked to sit and watch movies, she’d say “are you seriously this boring? It’s the weekend don’t you have to go out?”. She told me she’ll cut ties with the other guy within a week, she didn’t do it for months… I don’t know if she ever did. \n\nThen came this fear of infidelity in me. I started getting worried out of nowhere if she’s going to cheta on me. She sents me pictures of her being with other men, and that started hurting me. I didn’t have this concern before, in previous relationships. \n\nThen came the cycle. Out of the blue she cut ties with me. She was so sweet for like a minute, and then out now a split second, she stares threatening and shouting. I got scared and anxious when she did that, and I observed myself trying to justify, and responding in an afraid manner. \n\nThen the breakups come one after the other.At first I was okay, I mean I felt sad about missing all the love she gave, all the fun I had, but I because I worked out, got a few friends, I was okay! \n\nThis cycle went on for 7 -8 months out of my 1 year masters where I was in contact with her . I was discarded around 6 times, where she came back again and again, texting me and telling me I couldn’t find anyone else like you, the  the romance was there. Even to this day (it’s been over a year), I still remember the PHYSICAL RUSH OF SOMETHING inside my brain I got when she started texting me after discards. I’ll never forget that, and I’ve never felt that after! \n\nBy the end of the 7 month, my left arm and leg was paralyzed. I was hospitalized for 2 months. I got so much panick attacks I was in the streets of Madrid, on the floor crying. After the 6th discard, I woke up, dressed myself, to go and sit infront of her university, just to see her pass by infront of me, hoping she would say hi. It got worse. I even tried calling her from other numbers, friends. The worst part is I didn’t have any CONTROL, I was like this machine - my fingers were doing these things on their own. Here were the words I told my parents “please help! I don’t have control over myself, if I stay here in Madrid I’ll do things I’m not supposed to do”, and I took a ticket back to Qatar after the 6 th discard. I was in the floor at the airport when my parents came and picked me up. I stayed home for a month and then I was getting better. She texted again. \n\nI let her in. I came back to Madrid - for her, got a job. Got the 7th discard, lost my job, went mad again. \n\nBut with therapy, regular working out, going on dates, reading about narcissistic abuse (this was game anger, and I didn’t even know this existed - awareness about it helped), this time my healing was .. “better”.\n\nRight now, I got my paralysis fixed. \n\nBut this is where u need your help\n\n. It’s been 7 months if not more I’ve seen a TV show or movie, which was something I used to love to do. I tried to watch movies and tv shows, but the visions of infidelity, romance, gives me an ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAIN making me fall to the floor. I don’t know how to tackle this, I tried exposing myself to more shows, nothing works. \n\nIt’s been 7 months I’ve been trying to get a job. I  could get a job in the Middle East, but I’m “forcing” myself to get a job in Madrid (I tried to think why, and I think the ONLY way I’ll get over this girl, is by getting a job in madrid. Whereas in the Middle East I could get a higher paying job, I don’t know how to change this narration. \n\nShe texted me again 2 weeks ago, I just deleted the text. It would be a lie to say I’m not addicted to her, or my decisions are greatly influenced by the visions of her (every fucking day). \n\nMe coming from the Middle East, she showed me so many places and things in Madrid, I don’t know how to take her off my head. Please help me.\n\n",

        "Text": "I've been in no contact for almost a month in april to may. I deactivated all my accounts, and he began to reach out during the second week. His multiple attempts to contact me, trying to get me back, ignited the hope in me that he might change. (But he didn't)\n\nI tried going back to him on May 15th, hoping to fix and rebuild our relationship. We started talking again, but the connection and energy weren't like before. His Instagram was still linked to my phone, and I watched him trying to flirt with other guys. I realized then that I was just an option, a spare wheel to him if things didn't work out elsewhere. I confronted him, and his excuse was, \"Is it bad to talk to other people and expand connections?\" It was the most bs thing I'd ever heard.\n\nWe had a big fight over it, and he accused me of leaking his \"alter account.\" I had found out about that account last January. My fault was turning a blind eye to it. Then in March, I discovered he was active again on a gay dating app, talking to a bunch of guys on Facebook, and sending dck pics on Twitter. I'm the only one who knows he's been sending nude photos and videos of himself jrkng off, and now he blames me for his leaked scandal. How could a person accuse me of such a thing when I had forgiven him so many times for cheating on me?\n\nAll I ever did was show him genuine love and care. I never tried cheating back because I loved him too much. I stayed when everyone told me not to. I stayed when it wasn't worth it. I stayed even when I was continuously disrespected and my worth was questioned. I stayed even though I knew we were long overdue. And I would have stayed forever, despite everything, because losing him would hurt more. That's why I chose to stay. But I was wrong.\n\nIt's not the times when we chose to separate or the multiple times he cheated on me that hurt the most. It's the fact that he never realized how much I loved him and that I could never wrong him. I was so loyal to him that I even betrayed myself. Eventually, that gave me the drive to cut ties with him. I blocked all of his accounts.\n\nNow, I'm having a hard time trying to move forward. The trauma bond was real and strong. Whenever he apologized and tried to make up for cheating before, he would love bomb me in an attempt to show he had changed. I'm still having nightmares and am constantly afraid of seeing him in public.\n\nSometimes I have urges to go back to him. When that happens, I think of all the times he emotionally abused me, gaslit me, and manipulated me. Sometimes I wish he would message me and apologize for all the things he did, but I know a narcissist will never be truly sorry for what they've done. Even after what he did to me, I still see the greatness in him. I wanted it to be him so badly tho. and I wanted to work things out for us. But I guess it will never be, and it should never be.\n\nI'll move forward, get over him, and hope to never hear anything about him again. I know I was never what he wanted. He just liked the idea of having me, and he kept me around because I would always come back to him. If he moves on by jumping to another guy, that's it. I'll continue no contact forever. Maybe that is the closure I need. The continuous disrepect and abuse is the closure. \n\nI'm still thankful for the life we shared, but may the universe forbid us from crossing paths again.",

I let it go for a few days because I was concerned it was possibly from someone I didn’t want to hear from as I don’t know that many ppl in this area as it is.\n\n I messaged the person back and said “thank you but sorry I am not sure who this is?” It was my ex and he almost immediately replied back letting me know in the same message that he was also engaged and that his resource guarding pupper was getting along great with his fiances two kiddos. \n\nI have no hate towards my ex, I got away, I’ve started over. However, all I could think to do was reply back that I was happy they were happy. I received a “mhmm” to that and that’s when he told me how his dog was doing with the kids and asked how my dog I took with me was doing. I then blocked him because it legit triggered me.\n\nMy pup almost died in his care because he wasn’t feeding her while I was at work and she’s such a small dog that it affected her blood sugar. I did not stay long after that incident. This “man” wasn’t working, just playing video games all day and when I’d come home and ask why he hadn’t considered cleaning he would say everytime “you don’t deserve it.” \n\nHe also would let me know that he wasn’t attracted to me and that I would never find anyone else because I was “too old”. He would threaten to end himself if I left; it was terrible. I am so grateful I got away but for some reason I’m super triggered by his contacting me. \n\nWhat did he gain from doing that? I figure he will do it again as this is the second new number I’ve had to block of his. I figure his gal has no idea he’s even trying to contact me. I figure he also lied to her about having a job. I HOPE he has a job now at least for his new families sake. \n\nI am angry that it’s bothering me and just need to vent.

If you don’t agree, no one will. Or you’re a liar. If you were who I thought you were, you would agree with me.” I often end up just changing my standpoint to agree with him and he would almost instantly be appeased and happy about it;\n\n* Blames others for things he or others did or didn’t do: \n\nExample: Something he says almost every night is:“I don’t care about the schedule anymore. I don’t want to get up early.” and gets angry and hurt if I don’t try to convince him to stick to the schedule that he keeps saying is important to him; \n\n* Rarely actually apologizes: \n\nExample: (After cussing and insulting me) Him:“I'm just saying what you're thinking about yourself. You and your behavior make me say these things. I'm sorry for falling for it. You make me do this”;\n\nI am expected to apologize upwards of a 100 times per day for anything from not bringing enough food, glancing away from him during a conversation, saying a joke he didn’t understand or find funny, talking in a higher pitch, not reacting immediately to his needs, suggesting to go on a walk when he didn’t feel like it, wanting to see friends/family, etc.;\n\n* No freedom: \n\nExample: (Context: I was invited to babysit my best friend’s cat over the weekend. She lives about 8 hours away, and my boyfriend and I didn’t have any plans for the next 2 weeks) “You should kys, the world would be a better place.” After I expressed that that had a negative effect on my mental health, he said:”I would never want you to do that and it’s your fault that I said it. I was totally justified in my reaction. And it’s your fault that it affected you. You hurt your own feelings and you really hurt my feelings now. And I partially regret saying that to you because I love you, but if it was anyone else and I thought that they are bad for society, I would say that and mean it”;\n\n* Controlling: \n\nExample: Him:“Your coat looks like something a grandma would wear and I will not be seen in public with you wearing it”;\n\n* Criticism and putting down: \n\nExample: Him:“You suck at playing guitar so much. If I was you I would be embarrassed to say that I played at a festival and at school and was in a band, etc. You say you're proud of it. You shouldn't be proud. Just let go of your pride and take it when I say that you suck and you're terrible at it. I was better than this when I was just starting to play”;\n\n* Superiority: \n\nExample: Him:“I like you because you are so smart, like me.” Also him:“I feel like I'm dating a retard. Are you a retard?”;\n\n* Talking in a condescending way about previous partners: \n\nExample: Him:“My ex was so abusive and hit me many times and threatened to call the police as a means to control me. I was the perfect boyfriend the entire time and she was just stupid and crazy and would hit me and be dramatic about everything and kept acting as if I’m gonna hurt her which just isn’t true” but he would praise them as great and so much better than me if I made any mistake;\n\n* Expecting a mind-reading servant: \n\nExample: Him:“I’m upset and you can help but I’m not gonna tell you what would help me feel better. It’s not coming from you if I tell you what would help me. You should know me well enough to figure it out. If you can’t tell what I need and want without me telling you it just means that you don’t know me”;\n\n* Insecurity that ends with expecting lots of appreciation: \n\nExample: Him:“You need to show more appreciation for the things I do. I know you show that you like and use them and you say “Thank you”, but for what I have been doing for you you should be kissing my boots and begging me to forgive you for not showing more appreciation”;\n\n* Assuming others don’t have something valuable to say: \n\nExample: Him:“After Iinterrupt you while you’re talking, I don’t ask what you wanted to say because I assume what you’re gonna say isn't important so I don't follow up nor want to hear it”;\n\n* Not taking “no” for an answer and lack od empathy and care: \n\nExample: “What do you mean you don’t feel in the mood to make love right now? Is it because I wasn’t in the mood a few days ago? You’re just saying that as revenge. You’re feeling sick and nauseous? What does that have to do with this? It doesn’t prevent you from making love. It’s a dumb excuse.” (Continues to nag and wake me up throughout the night until I agree);\n\n* Gaslighting: \n\nExample 1: Him“You’re a crazy bitch and everyone in the world would agree with me. I was thinking of leaving a message to your family telling them that you’re insane and need therapy”; \n\nExample 2: Me:”I feel bad when you use name-calling in arguments”, Him:”Me calling you a bitch, dumbass, stupid, crazy, etc. is just how I express my feelings and you calling it name-calling and insulting is name-calling and insulting to me. I agree they are not nice words but they don’t mean anything and I did nothing wrong, especially not name-calling”;\n\nExample 3: Him:”You’re angry.” Me:”I don’t feel angry.”, Him:”And you saying that instead of agreeing with me means that you’re angry!”;\n\n* No tolerance for self-respect or boundaries: \n\nExample: I left the room for 5-10 minutes to calm down after he hung up on me during an argument. After I came back he was already calling and said:“I insulted you and hung up on you and you make a big deal out of it? Get lost!”; \n\n* Cannot take criticism: \n\nExample: Him:”The teacher at school said that I wasn’t good at this during today’s activity. What does she know? I can see she can barely manage coming to class on time without losing her head from anxiety. She has no idea about this stuff and she doesn’t know me and yet judges me based on assumptions and looks,” also him:”I can’t do this. I suck at everything.” He flips between those two reactions whenever receiving criticism and it throws him off balance very much;\n\n  \nTL;DR - I suspect my boyfriend might be a covert narcissist or have some traits. I am trying to make sense of this situation. Could I be in an abusive relationship with a narcissist or someone with those traits?",

My voice message was calm civil and firm at the same time. No anger, no rage just nice.  I did not feel bad after sending him, i felt like i was able to breathe. My thought was let him have this win and victory. Did i just open the gates of hell again?  I did block him again so that is ok right since he was not able to respond? I promise never again! Huhu so the new gf is only assumption based on his posts in Ibiza. \n\nHere is my voice message: sorry kinda long olease bear with me! \n\nI just wanted to reach out now  to let you know that I've moved on and have already made peace with everything that happened between us. It's been over a month since we last spoke, and I've had time to process our breakup. I am indifferent in whatever storyline you want to share about our relationship and our fights in that 1 whole year. If blaming me, telling everyone you are not at faiult and rewriting history make things easier for you, make you feel better , that's fine. I have already told you this a month ago. \nI have also realized that you are not the man for me. We are not on the same level in so many ways. There is clearly no more future for us. \nI'm happy for you and your new partner. I hope its also a magical meet up and love story for you. I don't want to and would never interfere with your life anymore. What happened in Denmark and everything else—we both know the truth, and that's enough.\nI don’t think I could ever be with you again after you had your family and friends turn against me based on whatever you told them and again I am ok with that. Meanwhile, I’ve protected you and our relationship even after the breakup. I have kept quiet for more than a month despite your messages to everyone. \nI have also not said anything on social media until you have posted your new girl on your social media and some of my followers message me about it even if I didn’t even want to know tbh which left me with no choice but to publicly announce our break up. \nI do not understand why you want to talk to me when Removing myself from your life is clearly what you wanted, and I see that what you're doing now is exactly that. So, I'm just giving you what you want. We do not need closure. I already have my closure. \nYou already have a new gf.  I hope you guys will have lots of videos and photos together and i hope she takes good photos of you! I hope she adores you and showers you with love, praises, hugs and kisses!  And I hope when she tells you that your perfume smells good or you look good or you have a nice shirt, or nice watch, you would smile and think yeah SHE truly took care of me. And I hope your new gf does the same to you , including your family. \nI wish you all the best in your life and your relationships moving forward.\n\nTake care and stay happy. Bye. ",

        "Text": "Hi, I'm 31M, and I met the narc 34F 4 months ago, an we started dating Feb 29th of 2024.\n\nI'm a single man who hasn't dated in a while. I'm also in recovery living in Baltimore, MD. I met this girl at an NA meeting, and I walked into a meeting . She was there, and I ignored her for the most part in the beginning and hit on her friend. I thought she was very annoying. \nThe meeting etiquette is you listen to the speaker at the front of the room then after they are done you either share about how you liked they're story and relate in someway or share where you are in your recovery. \nFrom the beginning, when I met her, she just glommed onto me and sat next to me and yelled out while they were speaking with a tag like repeat the thing they said loudly and she would laugh. \nThen I made the mistake of walking in and handing her 2 vapes I didn't like the flavor of. After this, she always sat next to me and started laughing and touching me on the arm or leg. Then, one of my friends saw us sitting together and said, \"Why don't you hit on her?\" She told me she had a fiance, so I told him that's why in front of her. \nThen, a minute later, she said very quickly, \"He stopped texting her all together, and they were now broken up.\" So right after she asked for my number and we started texting back and forth immediately she started with the \"love bombing\" texting me every minute making me feel so important and loved for weeks while she was on restriction at the female house she lived in for breaking rules. \nI asked her to come over when she got off restriction, and she did. we lay down in my bed and talked about everything our lives, trauma, our drug use, music, and past relationships. That night, we went to a meeting, and after we came back, I made out and had sex. When I was about to pull her pants off, I asked how long she wanted to wait before sex she said 2 weeks, I kissed her more passionately, and that wasn't the same answer after that. Shortly after that, I started noticing things we would be standing somewhere together, and a guy would come and ask if she needed a ride home she said no, so I let it go. Then another time he came up and asked if she was alright out of nowhere. I asked, \"What's that about?\" She said,\"I have no idea. \" \nSo I let it go again then I would get the mean muggs from different guys in the meetings some I knew and some I had never spoken to in my life it'd a small place but still I didn't know these guys why would they hate me? Then one night it came to a head when a guy I never spoke to saw us sitting on a raised platform in the meeting he's walking back and forth in the back of the room mean mugging me walking up to all his friends saying he fucked her that day twice i read his lips. She pretend she didn't see this I of course was very upset and I get very quiet when I'm angry and I walk outside maybe wait for him or her to chase after me nothing all the while she is texting asking \"if I'm okay\" I text back \"I'm fine just tired just got off work\". \nThen she asked if I want to leave the meeting and go to my place we are standing outside waiting for the Uber and the same guy followed us outside and was just standing there with his friend menacingly staring not saying anything just watching us. She's looking down at her feet the entire time, and she says, \"She's a piece of shit.\" I asked, \"Why?\" No answer. I think she fucked him and he expected her to tell me and I would hit her or something so he was standing there to make sure I didn't idk never would. \nWe got back to my place, had sex and I'm laying there really quiet. Then I asked her, \"What that was all about?\" She doesn't know why he followed us out there he's crazy/stalker she had no idea blah blah blah. I broke up with her then and there she said I was \"doing it for no reason,\" even tho I'm pretty sure the guy would have killed me if I looked at her wrong. \nI asked her for the truth, and she said, \"She didn't know him. All she did was say hi/bye to him. People are crazy.\" I said, \"I'm sick of walking into meetings and getting menacingly stared at by people I never knew or talked to once.\" The common denominator is her it never happened before I started seeing her. We broke up and agreed to be friends with benefits, nothing more. Anytime I bring it up, she gives me the same nonsense story every time. \nThen I start reading about covert narcissism, and it's like checking off boxes. I know she has at least talked to 2 other guys, probably done more. I'm working on an exit plan because if I break it off, she will make my life hell, and we live in the same area. I still have to live here for a while, at least. I know it's a long story, and there is so much more. Thank you for taking the time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

They had the same interests, they were on the same level success-wise. It was clear they admired this person. Anytime I remember that screen recording, I can't help but feel bad because:\n\n1. They never admired me to the same level as that person, even when we were in a relationship. They even called that person's work their favorite and they will truly never ever do it with mine because I never succeed with anything\n\n2. I will never be on the same level of success as them both. I already tried\n\n3. I remember one message where my nex suggested working together with that one person. This, in turn, made me remember how they never suggested the same thing to me, how they always quit each project we did together and left me alone to struggle. It also clearly points at the fact that they cannot get what they want from me, or could not. \n\nTo make it clear, they sent me that screen recording before we entered a relationship (we were very close friends back then). Them and that person had no relationship history, the context was to prove to me that they chat with other people less than with me. And it happened at around the same time as when the abuse started. Just a while before that, they required intimate pictures from me, even though we were not even involved. What do I do with this feeling?",

        "Text": "\nHello. I’m really confused about a situation I was in. Basically my boss and I were friendly like I felt like I was always there when he needed me like my support or help or advice or anything. He felt easy to talk to like we related to each other it felt familiar.\n\nYears later he started to flirt with me. I didn’t think anything at first I thought he’s just trying to be nice to get he to work extra shifts or whatever. But it was more than just causal flirting he was constantly rubbing up against me getting really close. sometimes touch me or touch by hair. Teased me. All the signs that he liked me were there so I was like oh maybe he does really like me I thought about it I thought maybe  there were signs I missed previously . I knew he has some type of trauma he’s hiding i can tell. He puts on a mask like he’s happy everything’s ok but I got to see the real him a few times we talked about life and our depression anxiety and it was nice to like emotionally connect with someone. Me and my husband don’t even really connect emotionally like that really.\n\nI got so attracted to him out of nowhere. And I realized we were so alike almost the same person. And I started seeing signs I thought like his name his car songs came on that constantly reminded me of him. I googled what it meant and somewhere came across twin flames and was convinced it was that. I asked if he liked be and he didn’t answer changed the subject but looked away and smiled and blushed. one day he wanted to go to a restaurant with me then said oh I was just kidding then said do you want to go with me forever. he stared at me really deeply I thought he loved me my Husbsnd doesn’t even look at me like that . I would always catch him staring at me cause he would look away as soon as I look.\n\nI tried to kiss him one day and he backed away really quick I was like wtf. I said I know you like me he said yea as a friend ! I said I know you want to kiss me and he said not here come to ( restaurant ) . I was so upset I wrote a huge email which prob sounded psychotic but I said I felt lead on and why would he flirt with me if I’m married anyway and we have a good relationship . I Saadi are you not getting enough attention from your gf.\n\nhe didn’t respond to my email .he didn’t really talk to me for months then one day decided to talk again acted like nothing happened. He never apologizes for anything but knows when im upset cause when im not talking to him he would push me or something. the one day i told him he didnt apologize he said grow thicker skin\n\nHe did seem like he had a sad look on his face a few times I was upset though. He looked sad day after email too so the emotion is there it’s just he wants to hide it . His eyes got big and looked sad when I told him I was applying for another job Too.\n\nHe left the job now . I was hoping I would get some answers but prob never will. It’s killing me ny mind won’t rest.  I thought it was twin flames with the nonstop thoughts. I randomly cry off an d on .\n\nDoes this sound like a trauma bond with a narcissist? Or he has feelings but just won’t tell me? I just thought it has to be something cause I saw signs and why would he play games that if I’m married and he’s my boss wouldn’t he want to go after someone else. I mean he did flirt with someone else I think too but not as much as me. Do narcissists really act like they are in love with you if they aren’t? even if the flirting was fake I thought his smile and way he looked at me couldn’t be faked. Or he just loved the attention not me ? Im questioning my whole life I don’t know who I am anymore . do I love my husband . I thought I loved this person . Am I a narcissist like him that liked the attention . why is this happening.\n\n\n",

He replies “don’t, just DON’T”. I say sorry and he replies that I have a major lack of self respect, I am constantly breaking boundaries,  etc. I snap, we argue, I tell him to block me and he does after thanking me for coming over that morning because it helped and made him feel better, and good luck with therapy and he’ll see and talk to me later.",

He started posting his selfies with different women he is hanging out with in Ibiza.  And of course random people sent me and kept messaging me about it since i have a huge following even if i didnt look at his socials or did not even want to know! Some even called him out and messaged him that it is too disrespectful for him to post women he is with a month after our breakup.  \n\nI posted a video on my socials crying just letting my followers know that we have broken up. I felt like i already had to do it to somehow take my power back since he knows social media is a part of my daily for my business and more also because i can no longer take his torture and torment to hurt me mess with me via his social media posts.   I have also been geting messages from random people asking about our relationship and I felt like I owe it to my followers since they followed my journey and i have been open about my life to inspire people. I did not say anything negative about him , just plain and simple we broke up, i walked away from the relationship and him because i had to choose myself since we are not aligned with goals and priorities.  it was a positive video where i focused on healing and lessons and hope despite my heartbreak.  I did wish him well on my video though. \n\nI believe he already saw that video since someone also sent me screenshots of their messages to him telling him how he does not deserve me at all and while i am focused on healing , he is showing off pretend to living it up posting women trying so hard to get attention but deep inside they know he is crumbling. \n\nI felt a little joy in a sense because i did not expect my followers and other friends to support and defend me even without me knowing or asking. \n\nSomehow i want to think that my video and messages from people messed up his ibiza saturday night lol i know i should not think that way but but he was the first one who kept posting on his socials knowing most of his followers are from me, followed him because of our supposed love story. \n\nI hope my video did not blow up his ego! Or he will think he won somehow! I dont want to give him that satisfaction!  Or did it? Huhuhuhuhu \n\nAnyway one thingbis for sure he already talked to his mom about my video and his mom talked to the whole town about it and about me! Lol his mom and his low life drug addict friends are the only ones on his side, a huge part of his family sided with me when he treated me like garbage. \n\n",

He has called him stupid, an idiot, a bonehead, a loser and a follower. Meanwhile, he treats his other son like gold. I have tried to intervene over and over, which usually results in his rage being directed at me.\n\nI was remembering a day when he was 'helping' him with homework. He was 7 at the time and not understanding what my brother was telling him. My brother berated him, yelling \"I know you know how to do this\". I tried to step in and he yelled at me. His wife finally came home and I directed her his way. She heard him yelling at their son and tried to intervene but he yelled at her. She walked away and allowed him to continue with the abuse.\n\nThis has been going on all these years. I have talked to the wife many, many times, pleading with her to get some help. Finally, recently, I thought I had convinced her (after my brother berated my nephew for losing a tennis match) but when I talked to her she said they were 'too busy' and walked away from me. After all this time my kind, laid-back nephew is shutting down and showing signs of his own anger. He doesn't want talk about it and and pretends everything is fine (just like his mom). I don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated.",

        "Text": "\nHi guys, so I went on this overseas exchange 2 years ago as part of college. Met a few friends, formed a friend group. Me and one of the guys had a situationship, and he was predatory as fuck but I didn’t realize it then because I was under the love bombing spell.\nSo fast forward within a day of confessing, he wanted to have sex. I said no and he agreed but was passive aggressive about it. I kept him along and I did develop feelings for him ( it was his manipulation). After the trip (it lasted for a month) he continues to pester me for sex. By then, we had a friend group. When I refused again, he said he had another girl he was interested in. Then he then said he was cutting me off and I basically cut off all contact with him and the friend group after that. \n\nI’m still angry over this, and I do miss my friends. I messaged one of them who I was close to yesterday and she didn’t reply. Ghosted again. \n\nAdvice on how to move on? I feel so much anger towards the man who cut me off and destroyed the whole friend group. He continued to hang out with them and none of them contacted me after he cut me off, so they made it pretty clear who’s side they were on.\nI really need some advice because this keeps bothering me again and again.\nThank you guys so much ",

I once loved a person more than anything, we wanted to marry and grow old together, but a conniving narcissist infiltrated our lives and turned us against each other, convinced us that we weren't meant to be together. Now, five years later, i am finally free of this old, pathetic shithole, but instead i now have to deal with the fact that everything he ever touched, he destroyed. He destroyed my entire life, and not only will I never get to be with this person whom i once loved, for he has married someone else, but the worst part is..\n\nI don't think i am capable of loving another person like that again. I honestly feel incapable of ever letting someone get that close to me again.. it's like, i just don't have the emotional capability, levels of trust and love to ever feel that way about someone again. It's like the narcissist has completely eroded me from the inside out. I used to be kind and loving, but now i just feel dead and hollow inside. Is this normal? Has anyone ever felt like this and gotten better in the long run? I am so sad and devastated right now. All i can think about is getting revenge on the psycopath, since i have nothing left to lose apparently. I want to destroy him, like he destroyed me.",

        "Text": "Did I deal with a Narcissist? Advice needed\n\nMe: 34F (was 33F when we met) - US citizen\nHim: 32M (was 31M when we met) - NOT a US citizen\n\nI met this guy on a dating app 19 months ago. We hit it off real quick. He took me out on several dates. Our dates included: mosque (first date…I know not my idea), dinners, movies, hiking, beaches, boardwalks, etc. He drove me, picked me up, and would not let me pay for anything. He gave me affection (something I never truly fully experienced before). He paid for all the dinners. Mind you ALL photos we took were with HIS phone. He had all photos of us together (which religiously is against our religion to begin with). He also had a lot of info about where I work live who my parents family friends are etc. He was getting his MD PhD at the time and still had time to take me out. I already had my MD and was practicing. He added me to his friends wives group and introduced me to them which I was uncomfortable with (on our second date). He told me he really liked me and could see me as a wife, etc. know he was busy but he was very responsive to texts. (FYI he was married/separated, not yet divorced). \n\nHe fed me all these things about his ex wife and all the trouble she caused him and he is lucky he left her. He basically was saying she was not willing to do what the couples therapist had told them to do and was off. Basically he showed himself in the best light possible and basically described her as his crazy ex (they were married for 3 months before they separated and he puts the blame on her). A little over 3 months after the start of the relationship, he would take forever to reply, leave me on read or do not disturb, take forever to reply. We were both busy but I would always at least respond within a couple hours. He would leave me on read for 2 days AND blame shift. I asked him what was wrong After my last message, he GHOSTED me (I thought it was because he was busy). I felt insecure a low. I also had other things going on. Was I love bombed?\n\nI told my best friend everything that happened and she put me in the red flags group. She posted anonymously him as a red flag (I gave her the green light to do so). Was I wrong to spill everything he privately told me, sure, but I felt played and truly hated someone else would be involved with someone like that. Basically the post had very specific details. Honestly I forgot about the post once it was posted and basically focused on other things and moved on. I totally forgot about this man and what happened. \n\nWe were cordial on instagram and Facebook. He would periodically like my stories. I even congratulated him on his MD PhD. I didn’t think anything of it.\n\nIdk why this happens to me but maybe I am a lover girl at heart. Anyways recently he came back into my life. He asked me out on a date to apologize. We had about 7 dates and he showed me affection and seemed very serious. One of the dates we were hiking down steep place and we got to the end and he said “I can even carry you from here,” I said no, he is supposed to be “religious” so why would he think that, anyways he basically just picked me up WITHOUT MY CONSENT (I don’t let men carry me like that also for personal and religious purposes it’s a boundary) and I asked him to put me down and he did not even apologize (scheme to love bomb me and make me think he’s “all in.” Anyways other dates he basically was being very serious about marriage (it’s like a cultural thing we usually try to get engaged pretty soon after meeting for religious purposes and stuff). Okay, I am stupid for the following but he asked for my parents numbers to ask for my hand and their full names to ask about them (which I stupidly gave, it’s a cultural thing). On our seventh date he asked me all these questions about my expectations of marriage and all that. We seemed to align really well or so I thought.\n\nPlot twist: on our 7th date at night we were in a private area. He asked me to make him cookies and coffee that I specialize in which I did. As we were talking, he basically said I have a question and swear on your life you will say the truth. He said “why did you spam my friends’ wives and friends” I was like wtf he said “Yea I was getting spammed I know it was you.” I had no idea what he was talking about. He then pulled his phone up and showed me a screenshot of the red flags post. I was like oh I totally forgot about that but I told him yes I told my friend about you and got you added to this after ghosting me and lying to me. He said his friends wives in the Facebook group got spam messages about his fiancé etc. I had no idea what he was talking about. But apparently he only told me and no one else and had no other dates about his separation and marriage and apparently only me. He had even told his “friends” that he was “married” and they don’t know anything about the separation and divorce. He basically wanted to preserve an image he was married and was the perfect guy. \n\nAnyways I never reached out to his dumb friends or spammed them with multiple numbers or whatever. I low-key believe he was making it up but even if true it wasn’t me. He said these messages and friends thinking differently of him (basically the liar he is) put him in a deep depression and how I am a psychiatrist and I basically used my field to manipulate him. (His posts on Facebook and instagram did not show he was depressed, he was photographed and videoed with outings with his friends), He told me even if he hurt me it was not proportional to what I did about the post (which apparently led to people spamming him for like a week and that put him in a deep depression for months and how he can’t look his friends in the eye anymore. And he said “you’re a citizen, if I lose my job I would have to go back to my country etc.) and you have nothing to lose because you have your job here.” Idk how his job and life in the US would be affected by a red flag post (or as he claims his friends getting spammed) He admitted to tricking me and getting close to me because he had no other choice as it was the only way he would get me to admit to it and he had ZERO intention of getting with me and marrying me. He also said he got my information because “I know things about him and he doesn’t about me and doesn’t know “what else I am capable of.” \n\nHe said he saw the post maybe 17-18 months ago. I asked him why he didn’t just text me then or ask me then and to delete it if it was through me. He said I wouldn’t have admitted to it, I said you could have asked to “delete it” if it was me to avoid any harm to his reputation and I would have done so he said “nah.” He had to plot for 17-18 months his revenge. He said it was not revenge and he said “I forgive you for the post. I know what I did was worse and I am going to go home and pray and repent for this sin, I knew going into it was a sin and probably worse than what you did to me.” He then started giving me “advise” on to clean my heart and intentions and how I will find the right guy. He said we could have been a potential 19 months ago and now is hard maybe we could be potential in the future but this tainted it. He knew I was NOT dating anyone else for the past 19 months but kept repeating “you just need to not rush it. you are a good person you will find the right guy etc.” I was too tired to be honest so we just ended the “date” and left on “good terms.” He offered to “help me” find a spouse. He even closed on “please forgive me from your heart.” He was basically trying to minimize what he did and deflect to the reason he had to was because “I did.”\n\nReflecting back I despise him. I want to clear things up: 1. My intentions are pure and clean 2. I am in no rush 3. He is evil for what he did and a liar. 4. He has a sister and to watch out for harm (maybe my karma was this for the post that was posted to WARN others) but it was not out of evil or bad intentions. He plotted revenge. I also have some device of his I forgot to give back from 19 months ago. AND tell him I DO not forgive him and will let God deal with him. Should I ask to meet or forget it?\n\nWas I love bombed the first time?\nWas I wrong to post in the group, I mean I know I was, but to what extent?\nWas my post which I guess as he claims led to spamming and his friends thinking differently and finding out he’s divorced and him claiming he was depressed worse than my stupid red flags post (which he is a red flag)?\nDid I deal with a narcissist?\nIs he remaining on “good terms” with me to make sure I don’t retaliate?\n\nI am lost and confused. I feel sick and a fool. I am traumatized now TWICE by him. Second time even worse he played with my emotions INTENTIONALLY to sadistically get to what he wanted (when he could have asked to meet or asked about it 17-18 months ago. I am so disturbed and don’t know what to do. If he wasn’t a red flag then he for sure is now. \n\nI feel utterly more insecure now and have paranoia that all guys are like this. He doesn’t know what he did to me.\n\nDid I deal with a covert narcissist specifically?",

They will clear their schedule to get you right where they want you. \n\nDuring lovebombing, they promised you something. Maybe it was a baby. Maybe it was marriage. Maybe you moved in together, or made a big investment in their business or other affairs. \n\nAs soon as that transaction is complete, you can bet you’re in devaluation.\n\nThe narcissist met you and saw you as better than they. They genuinely believed their obsession was love. But really it was a warped sense of envy wrapped in lust. \n\nNow that the narc has you in the deal, it’s time to destroy you. \n\nNobody can be better than the narc. A peak inside the narcissistic subconscious:\n\n*if I learn everything about them through my obsession, I can possess what I love about them for myself. Once I get all that I need from them, I’m going to break their fuqn back.*\n\nAll of a sudden, you, the caring, sensitive, nurturing person is making dinner. Making breakfast. Picking up dry cleaning. Scrubbing the toilets. \n\nNothing is ever good enough. You don’t get a thank you or any credit. They want your wallet. Your time. Your resources. So you work harder. The harder you work, the more tasks are on your list…\n\nUntil you snap. \n\nThe narc can do these tasks, but the narc is too busy trying to destroy you to do it themselves. \n\nThe narc needs you to meal prep for them. Take care of the baby. Drop off the kids at school. \n\nOnly what you don’t do will be scrutinized. \n\nOnce you explode in exhaustion. You’ll get a bread crumb. \n\nBack on the hamster wheel you go as your narc monkey branches onto the new supply. \n\nYou’re getting tired now. Dull and lifeless. \n\nWho wants to deal with all this arguing you’re doing? \n\nThe narc is a God on earth. Finding someone happy about their psychological enslavement is easy. \n\nRest assured the new supply will be told about the list of things you didn’t do for them. \n\nThey will be caring and nurturing, too. They will cry for the narc as they hear about how terrible of a servant you’ve been. \n\nYou’ll say, “but I was a slave for you!” \n\nThe narc will say “I didn’t tell you to do that, you did that because you wanted to.” \n\n",

        "Text": "After a tumultuous relationship, my (then) partner of \\~5 years unexpectedly moved out of our shared apartment while we were both away visiting our respective families.  She had a dramatic personality change overnight - she became cold, callous, and (seemingly) full of rage/contempt. There were vague hints of this before, but nothing quite like this.  (After the relationship ended, I was diagnosed with a host of C/PTSD, adjustment, anxiety, and depression symptoms, and the professionals think I am likely trauma bonded.  They won't diagnose her, but strongly suspect BPD/vulnerable NPD-like traits, and that my behaviors to her were largely reactive.)\n\nIn her most extreme moments, it felt like she was Jekyll and Hyde - like she changed suddenly and everything about me was wrong. There would be strange accusations (e.g., I was using her - and all men use women - usually for purposes that could not be articulated but sometimes for things like sex), and she expressed resentment for things she previously claimed she wanted to do.  Sometimes this included: threats of self-harm; literally getting on the ground and grabbing onto me while she cried when she thought I was going to leave her (I wanted to get away for a day to cool things down); leaving the apartment to try to sleep outside on a bench; slamming doors/cabinets; blocking doors; yelling at her dog.  But there were also subtler \"episodes\" - she seemed mad at me (facial expressions, changes in tone, stonewalling, slamming) and upset by me (crying, locking herself away). She would suggest that I said or did hurtful things, and I tried to address them, but it often seemed like there was always SOME reason to be upset with me, and it was allegedly never like this prior to our relationship. She used to say she wasn't \"emotional.\" And in the end, she would say I was either perfect or I was terrible.\n\nI told her I didn't want to do this anymore, she would apologize profusely and offer to change - but it was difficult to make changes last.  At times, my ex admitted that she may have been manipulative with her threats, and that she couldn't always remember what things she said, why she said them, or why she felt that way - except a few instances where she stated a fear of abandonment (ironically, I told her that I would never leave her in the middle of the night - I would never abandon her - it was too terrible to even consider).\n\nHere's my real concern: what if it's the other way around?\n\nWhat if instead of \"discarding\" me, she left an abusive/toxic environment?\n\nThe day(s) before she left, we were arguing but she told me she loved me, wanted to see me, she expressed physical intimacy, made joint plans together, reaffirmed commitments - but what if this was something like Stockholm Syndrome?\n\nWhat if I thought I was JADEing (this may not have been helpful, but presumably is not toxic), but I was actually DARVOing?\n\nWhat if every time she seemed like Mr. Hyde, it was a reaction to something terrible I had done?\n\nWhat if I was so controlling and manipulative I broke her, so somehow \"caused\" her to want to threaten to end her life?\n\nMaybe she wasn't idealizing and devaluing me - maybe I was the real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde all along.\n\nMaybe I'm not trauma bonded - maybe she's just my \"supply\" and I'm desperate to control her again, etc.\n\nWhen she needed constant reassurance and validation that I cared about her, to the point I felt hurt and burnt out, I basically demanded that she learn to self-soothe, lean on her support system (e.g., a therapist, other friends, etc.), and engage me with complaints/concerns/negative feelings when she could do some calmly and coherently. Was I being dismissive and invalidating?\n\nWhen I was upset, I thought I was putting up boundaries - that if she failed to take seriously her commitments, especially regarding helping herself and being a good partner, then we would have to change our relationship - but maybe they were \"threats\" to leave?\n\nWhen she said something uncharitable, I used to try to take her seriously - I would go so far as discuss whether I really was, in fact, a monster (a strange conversation to have).  But, eventually, I told her if she really thought I was so terrible - especially for reasons she often couldn't articulate or that seemed to be based on such terrible interpretations - that I couldn't understand why she was with me, and that she should leave.\n\nWhen I thought she was mistaken (or sometimes manipulative), and I tried to get her to see my point of view, what if I was gaslighting her instead of trying to understand her and help her understand?\n\nTo make things more confusing, when we fought, she often BEGGED me to take control - to tell her what to do or help get her to do things she said were valuable. I tried hard to do this - even though it felt paternalistic and I tried to ensure that this was something she REALLY wanted and that she understood that a healthy relationship can't ALWAYS be like this lest it turn into domination rather than a partnership. And she said she wanted it - she literally pleaded for it - but always seemed resentful when I tried to get her to do things or tell her what to do. (FWIW, I was never controlling in the possessive sense - I'm not jealous, I encouraged her to make connections and cultivate friendships, I cared for her when she needed, and was generally supportive of her hobbies, aspirations, relationships, etc.).  But she wanted to engage in activities that were deeply enmeshed (e.g., saving for a home or returning to school together), so these take a lot of joint work - and she claimed she wanted me to help \"make\" her do what needed to be done.\n\nAnd I sometimes talked to her the way she used to talk to me: I would tell her I thought that she hated me (she would accuse me of this earlier). By the end, I was bitter and resentful that it felt one-sided, and that she was neither grateful for my efforts nor truly committed to a partnership. I'm sure I was demanding, insensitive, and angry - she would get mad, and I would raise my voice (but would lower my voice when she noted it). I don't think I meant to be hurtful, but I can be very direct and sometimes I know I sounded harsh. But again, what if this is the story I tell myself - what if I was bitter, resentful, etc. throughout and she snapped because of me.\n\nThe last time we ever spoke, I know I yelled (I stopped when she mentioned it), and interrupted (she literally asked me to stop her from \"looping\" - where she repeats the same thing over and over - but I was too quick that time and basically shut her down in the moment). And I was demanding - that she had to make decisions and fulfill her shared commitments for things to work - that her actions and words needed to be in alignment. But mine weren't in those moments. And maybe I was too demanding - maybe that was controlling instead of boundary-setting.\n\nI feel terrible that she I may have caused her real hurt.  All I want to do is reach out to my ex and tell her I'm sorry for my problematic behaviors, I would do anything to make amends, and I'm developing the tools to have a healthy relationship - if she ever wants one. And if she doesn't, to let her know that I'll support her (by leaving her alone or being apart of her healing journey), and that I genuinely believe in our ability to change together - to create a mutually accommodating space built on respect, kindness, and understanding - if we're both willing to confront our darker sides.\n\nBut that's what abusers do, too, right? They want their person back - they love bomb , promise reform, say they'll do anything. Before I read anything about what happened, my immediate inclination was to write her a hand-written letter pleading for her to take me back, to help me understand I could do better, to send her things that were meaningful to us.\n\n(FWIW, I read most of Bancraft's \"Why Does He Do That\" and, while I worry that some of the behaviors might apply to me - specifically if I was overly sarcastic and if that was belittling - nothing else seems to ring true - though again, maybe I'm in denial. I sometimes felt like I was trying to get control of out-of-control situations that impacted my life - not that I wanted to control my partner as such. But again, maybe that's no different. And I often hear that abusers/narcissists/etc. aren't self-aware enough to question these sorts of things and commit to change, but surely there are exceptions - even the professionals I see indicate that there aren't many exceptions, but they exist.)\n\nThank you for your insights.",

And I've had it myself with my N and the scattered examples of people showing up in groups, wanting to hear something, then screaming and crying about being gaslit and abused over not hearing whatever they wanted.\n\nIt's like you have to walk on snowflakes with people nowadays or you get this never ending crying like they're toddlers who didn't get a candy bar. I used to think this behavior was specific to people like my N who are the rare few that have such cushy lives they've never been told \"no\" before, but now it seems like everyone new you run into can barely handle words they don't want to hear.

        "Text": "I was dating this guy for a few months.\nFirst few months he was extremely dismissive from the beginning held my hand literally on the 5th date was just always making faces. I would try to get close to him and stuff but he was very dismissive of my feelings in general and when I would open up he would just say shit like that's unfortunate or sorry you feel that way. He broke it off with me suddenly out of no where when I expressed him calling me skinny as fuck I was uncomfortable with it and I said it wasn't okay and I brought it up again because I brushed it under the rug. After I expressed how I felt he broke it off with me and said that my potential is unmatched. I was like okay whatever but then 3 months later he drops off a letter to my house saying that I'm the most beautiful girl he met even tho he never complimented me once before and that he let minor inconviences as a excuse to not be with him and he regretted letting me go. He would say weird shit like how he doesn't give compliments to people and how if you don't pray your a bad person. So I gave him another chance and things were going so well I was shocked on the changes he made he was being more open and he was complimenting me often paid for dates asked me everyday how my day was and was being warm and attentive. 1 month in everything was great until we hung out one day and my head was spinning (I'm dealing with a amnesia disorder currently) . I didn't talk to the store employees that was our first encounter of being in stores and i was being off and quiet due to my head spinning. He brought it up 2 weeks after saying my behaviour was rude and that he can't believe how I treat people like that and how I ruined his image and that he felt bad being seen with me and embarrassed he said that I'm using my amnesia as a scapegoat. And I wrote a letter explaining  I can't be with someone who cares about image more and that I feel like he constantly thinks about my flaws and I walk on eggshells. Then he called me with a big scary reaction saying that I'm egotistical, that I go to college and he goes to a better university, that he never should've settled with me, that I'm judgmental because I would talk tea about my friends I'm suddenly judgmental, that I made faces towards a homeless person cause a homeless person got too close to me and (I've been attacked twice but I do typically donate and do good deeds on my own without needing to tell anyone) and that he volunteered at homeless shelters and found me offensive, that he doesn't like a lot of things about me and that he thinks I need therapy.\nI couldn't have any say or any word in the argument i just stood there taking in everything barely processing it all. In the end he gaslighted me and I kept saying sorry for no reason. He didn't say sorry at all and blocked me and went on with his life saying that I fucked him over and that I burned him that he sacrificed so much family time to spend time with me.",

        "Upvotes": 6,
        "Text": "Really struggling emotionally with what my childhood experiences are “labeled”. I know physical abuse, I know emotional abuse. Is this considered sexual abuse? \n\nMy father loved to spank. It was almost like a sport to him, he would literally aim and move his hand in certain ways right before hitting as if he was warming up. He used his hand, but a lot of the times a belt was used. We had a dedicated spanking room in our house. He also loved to humiliate and embarrass.\n\nThis is where it’s very painful. There were times when my father would rip down our pants and underwear or lift up our dress/nightgown to remove underwear. Or sometimes he would order us to do it ourselves. He would use either his hand or a belt on our bare bottoms.\n\nThere was one instance that I remember that was insanely traumatic for me. I was showering with my little sister. I was around 8 years old and I was insanely insecure about my body. I didn’t want anyone seeing my body. All of a sudden we hear my father BANGING on the door screaming in a rage. I wrapped up in a towel and opened the door. He jerked me across the room into the bedroom, ripped the towel off my body, told me to put my hands on the bed (part of his spanking ritual) and beat me while I was completely nude. I remember feeling so confused and absolutely beyond violated and embarrassed. The most heartbreaking part was that I did nothing “wrong”, he was just mad and I was there to take his anger out. I still remember looking over at my little sister, nude with her hands on the bed,  staring into space waiting for her beating. \n\nI also recall another strange incident around the same age. I was showering (glass shower) and all of a sudden I hear “hey Sallie”, I look over and he’s in the corner of the bathroom. I scream and cover my body, and he laughs and leaves.\n\nWhere I struggle is that I know that my father is not a pedophile, he’s a narcissist who was/is hungry for power and control. I know there were zero sexual intentions.\n\nThe effects:\n\nAt this age (8) is when I began to experience issues with my bladder, specifically paruresis (shy bladder syndrome). I could no longer pee in a public restroom if someone was nearby. It got very bad in high school, my mother would have to pick me up from school to pee at home. It got to the point where I still couldn’t pee when I got home, and my mother would have to leave the house in order for me to pee. I began to have other health issues as a teenager, and two doctors asked if I had ever experienced sexual abuse. This is the first time I had questioned my past.\n\nOnce I hit my 20s and moved away from home, I began having nightmares of people trying to remove my clothes, or someone trying to pull a blanket off of me while I’m nude underneath. I always feel like people are looking at my ass. My hips sway forward and I clench my butt cheeks sometimes if someone is standing behind me. I’m now 25, and the years of constantly denying and ignoring my past have officially taken full effect. My abuse is all I think about. I am now in therapy beginning the healing process.",

We share the internet (the account is mine), so I'll have to tell her eventually that I'm cancelling the account. I haven't decided how much notice to give her. She will ask a bunch of questions I don't want to answer.\n\nI plan to hire movers. This is mainly because she is always at the house, and if I do the move myself she will probably come outside and try to talk to me. She might even ask if I'm keeping this or that and can she have it. She has no shame. \n\nI feel like she is trying to worm her way back into my life. She is doing some of the same things she used to do when we were friends: trying to get sympathy from me, texting me stuff she thinks I'll find interesting. I'm not falling for it.\n\nShe has not taken responsibility for what she did, nor does she seem to understand why I don't want to talk to her. \n\nI'll have to be careful about bringing boxes home. She pays way too much attention to other people. There was even a day when she admitted to looking through my car windows.\n\nAnyway, I'm posting this to see if anyone has any tips?

Even though I know it’s irrational but the desire to be treated humanely and with dignity respect felt so hard for me to accept someone can treat someone else like this- one thing he would continually do and say is insist he “cares for me” and when I prove he doesn’t “those are your words. You never heard those words come out of my mouth. Until I tell you I don’t want to talk to you, then assume I do etc. “ but then he goes full discard and silent treatment  and won’t answer at all and this can go on months despite begging . It’s pathetic on my end \n\nAnyways , I finally took a big step. I had the carrier block him - so I can’t manually unblock whenever I feel, and you guys it feels so freeing knowing the choice is made and I can’t just simply undo it in a few seconds . I feel relieved . I feel ready to live my life with that door fully closed behind me not half open like I kept it even unintentionally. \n\nHere’s to hoping I can be brave enough to embrace my future and leave the toxicity and hurtin the past. I know the hurt and pain are still part of me but I can choose to end the torture at least and give myself time to recover instead of reinjecting myself with poison or giving him more opportunities to hurt me.

        "Text": " \n\nWhy does a narcissist have to be right all the time? Why are they bent on having the last word, having the final say, and coercion until submission? \n\nI’m still learning new things. The term for this is “right fighting.” \n\nNarcissists right fight because they perceive being wrong with shame, and ultimately being bad. They are highly protective of their precious image. \n\nWhat victims need to understand is that when someone displays a pattern of right fighting with you, it is a marker of devaluation. It is a sign that reconciliation, compromise, and understanding are less important than your feelings and the health of your relationship. \n\nWhen you dismiss or challenge right fighting, there is no way to be a victor. The narcissist will use other manipulation tactics to ensure victory. Shaming, name calling, sarcasm, subject hopping, or stonewalling to achieve their selfish end. \n\nWhen this begins to occur with greater frequency, you can rest assured the narcissist is growing tired of you, and challenging the narcissists ideas will quickly become draining for them. \n\nThe narcissist is lazy and would rather have you lay prostrate in total submission. \n\nIt is important to note that this is a sign that you aren’t being loved. Right fighting is just one more tool in an emotionally manipulating tool box. \n\nIt is a marker that you are the enemy. Someone that loves you will value your opinion. When you love someone you will want to quickly resolve conflict. When you love someone, winning arguments will not be more important than the health of your relationship.\n\nPeople say “how do you know you were with a narcissist?” \n\nOr people that know my X pwNPD would say “oh they don’t seem that bad.”\n\nThis is how I know. The markers. The tools that were used on me. These tactics are developed and pruned over a lifetime. \n\nI didn’t make her right fight or want to “one up” people. \n\nWhoever is close to her will be treated this way once lovebombing ends. Because the next phase is devaluation. \n\nThat’s how the disorder works. \n\nEnjoy being right, girl ❤️‍🩹",

I don't want to let him change who I am as a person and start hating people, but I feel so hurt. Life is truly unfair.\n  \nIs it really possible for narcs to feel remorse? This situation is so extremely stressful, difficult, and life-altering. Maybe he really feels remorse, guilt, and sadness because of the severity of the situation, right?\n  \nIt's been 2 years, so he could've worked on himself and changed. What do you think? I want to break this trauma bond, but I can't help but romanticize the past still.",

        "Text": "So, i knew this guy for about 2 years and i thought we were friends or something but it seemed very superficial since we would never really hang out but when he would see me in the university library, he would come sit with me and talk. Since it seemed very superficial, i never really tried being friends with him but i was still friendly with him when he would talk to me. When he would talk to me, he would always be bragging about himself and boasting and making him seem like he is so grandiose and superior compared to others that we are acquainted to. \n\nA lot of the times, when i would mention something about me just because of the conversation topics, he would always try to one-up me and make him seem like he was better than everyone in the world. i don't know why but i overlooked those narcissistic traits despite i know quite a bit about narcissists since i have been victims of many narcissists in my life, i guess it is because i was trying to see him in a positive light and i never really tried to analyze his behaviour. \n\nFrom the first time i met him in my 3rd year of university, i was aware that he was a very insecure guy since he was always bragging about his grades and as time went by, recently, i started realizing that h has been lying about his grades since his grades in every test has been the same which is always 98, and it seems to much of a coincidence and i feel like he has been lying about them to seem superior to others because there is no way that he could be getting a 98 in every paper and every class and there is not a single fluctuation in them. Also, he is always trying to diminish other people's accomplishments like he call others stupid and lazy, \n\nQuite a while ago, we were talking about this acquaintance of ours who has been attending dental school for surgery for a year now and he tried to diminish the guy's accomplishment by saying that dentists aren't even real doctors when the acquaintance will become a dental surgeon in the future. Now comes the malice that he has been ding towards beside the one-upping. Since i kind of thought that he was my friend, i was telling him quite a lot about my personal life like my troubles and stuff. In my last year of university, i have been living with a narcissistic roommate for a whole year and whenever i would tell him about her, he would gaslight me by telling me that i'm probably imagining things and he would justify her actions. \n\nOne time i mentioned to him that my narcissistic roommate has been waiting for me at the door every night since i could see her waiting through the window and he was like \"it was probably just a coincidence and you're just imagining things.\" i knew that my roommate has been stalking me since she has been abusing me the. whole time that i was living with her but he always took her side for some reasons. Moreover, he insulted me on multiple occasions and called me schizophrenic and when i called him out and told him that he was hurting me, he was like \"it was just a joke.\" \n\nEvery time we have had a conversation, he called me schizophrenic and played it off as a joke. Another time, i told him about this guy who was following me and seemed like a stalker, he told me that \"You were probably just imaging things. Are you sure you're not schizophrenic?\" and then, i called him out again and he would again play it off as a joke. He also seemed to be very competitive towards me due to his one-upping behaviour all the time and he seemed to resent me for my parents paying for my tuition fees and him having to pay for his own fees and not his parents paying for his since he said some every insulting things like me depending on my parents while he has his own money to pay for his things. I did not say anything after he said that and i just brushed it off. \n\nHe has been gaslighting and insulting me since day one and has always one-upping so he can be seen as better and superior than me. I recently came to the realization that he is a narcissist and that he has been abusing me and using me as supply all this time. \n\nThe question is why has he been doing these things to me while pretending to be my friend like the gaslighting, the jealousy and one-upping?",

        "Text": "I’m struggling to understand if my spouse is a narcissist, selfish or both. Can someone provide clarity? He doesn’t take accountability for anything he is either defending his position or making excuses or turning the situation on to me…but does this make him a narcissist? Empathy nope, compassion not really. Selfish absolutely 💯. But he doesn’t exploit people for his own personal gain, he isn’t that arrogant or entitled. He does walk, bike and hike ahead of everyone always, has no real friends, is impulsive, has a fragile ego, likes his image, likes being the center of attention, is very dramatic, his inclination is to choose his own activities over the group or the good of the family but can be guided to the right choice. Like he might want to make a dinner reservation for 8pm after a day of hiking and full outdoor activities until I remind him we have a toddler and that would be a really long day getting home at 10pm …he’ll agree but doesn’t ever think of reason over his own desires first…ever. His family is the same way…I’m constantly reminding them we have a young one who needs food at reasonable times and rest and that overstimulation isn’t wise if we want a happy child and life 😆. I have also had 3 surgeries in the past 3 years due to the birth of our child none of which he helped me with and two of those I could barely walk and really needed help…and I’m not wimpy…I can take a lot of pain and I’m typically very healthy and fit. The last one after returning from the hospital he helped me get to the couch after I asked and then left me there for 3 hrs while he went on back to back conference calls. He is the boss he literally should not have scheduled that many calls knowing I couldn’t walk, get food, get dressed, get out of bed, shower, go to the bathroom. I needed assistance doing everything. I tried to walk to the bathroom on my own after 3 hrs and got stuck on the stairs in pain (crazy pain) I had to scream for him to get off his call. I was so embarrassed that someone he works with heard me but I had no option, I tried texted him and he never responded. It was the first time in my life I seriously thought I’m absolutely screwed if I get old with this guy…I’ll have to hire help or I’ll die 😟😩. Again not sure if that is just pure selflessness, narcissistic or both. I’m made a full recovery and I’m back to working out 🏋️ and running 🏃‍♀️ 5 days a week but it was really, really rough. I called my girlfriend crying and I never cry. 😭. What do you think? What are some key differences between a selfish person and a narcissistic one? ",

        "Text": "Hi everyone. \n\nYesterday I spent 5 hours reading old text messages from my ex narc. It was the X year anniversary of when we broke up, and this always makes me remember him. Sometimes when I think about him, I don’t exactly remember the horrible things he used to say to me. It feels like my brain has been deep fried from being in that relationship for XX years.\n\nI read about a specific argument that genuinely went on for 3 months. At the time, Covid had just hit and due to some circumstances we ended up being in a long distance relationship without a chance to see each other. This argument was about that he finally, after MANY years, wanted to get married to me. We are both from a culture where marriage was the only way we could stay together and I had fought for years for this to happen, however I was never good enough for him to commit to me. I changed myself maybe a thousand times, but each time was never good enough. \n\nBeing apart during Covid made me realize how unhappy I was, and how little I wanted to be in this relationship, but due to past experiences it was impossible to leave. So when he wanted to get married, I told him that I would get married to him if he promised to treat me better. I told him: if you can speak to me respectfully, not be annoyed and angry at me every day, not patronize me and call me names, listen to me when I’m upset, try to understand my feelings even if you don’t agree with me, compromise and speak to me respectfully then I would be happy to get married to him. These very basic wishes became an argument lasted that 3 months, ending with me giving up.\n\nThat argument was also about another thing, there is a feature about me that he used to dislike. One that I couldn’t change. Think about a feature you are born with and physically you can’t do anything about. He used to taunt me and say that he didn’t like women who are of this feature and that wasn’t his preference, and that I should do my best to change this feature. This always resulted in me never ever enjoying our outings cause I was in pain ALWAYS and he could see that, but he really did not care as long as I did what he wished. Him talking about my feature for so many years made my self esteem go rock bottom, and I mean rock bottom. He would always say that he’s not attracted to me, because of many reasons, and I could not take it anymore. I told him if he wanted to marry me, he can’t talk about my looks like that anymore. Long story short? He asked if I’m on crazy medication because clearly I was not right in the head for asking this of him.\n\nAfter years and years, I mentally broke down and needed to get away. It took all my strength, the help of SEVERAL family members and friends, and months and months of anxiety and depression to finally get out.\n\nYou might wonder why I had 5 hours to read those messages? Because after years out from that relationship, I had a 5 hours train journey back home to MY HUSBAND, after spending the weekend visiting my parents. My amazing husband who is the kindest man I have ever met. Who is loving and sweet and makes me feel amazing about myself every single day. Who lifts me up when I am down, makes me laugh and smile from my heart. Who can kindly disagree with me, but compromise and understand my point of view. \n\nWho respects me. And everything I am.\nIt feels SO GOOD TO BE MYSELF AGAIN!\n\nI was once unhappy, thinking happiness isn’t in the divine plan for me. I was wrong. For everyone who feels the same? You are wrong ❤️ you deserve happiness.\n\n\n",

It really helps me to vent my frustration. \n\nI have one lingering question I haven’t seem to find the answer to. Maybe you guys can help me out. \n\nAfter my painful discard, or during the discard, I was still living with my X pwNPD. She bought a house because she had made that promise during lovebombing and of course she had to destroy that shared fantasy. \n\nSo, after she cheated on me during our vacation we had planned for months, I didn’t know that she cheated on me yet. We flew home together and she pretended to let me try to “work things out” for a few weeks. During this time, she started to be nicer again. We started cuddling again, we went out on a few dates, and did the grown folks activity a few times as well. She kept texting me “baby,” and “I love you.” \n\nAfter it was more apparent that she had secured things up with her recycled supply which is her on again off again lady of the evening/coke saleswoman, she started becoming more nervous and more erratic. \n\nMy lingering question is why did she continue to call and text once this occurred? \n\nI understand that the discard is actually an illusion. Narcissists leave a big mess, on purpose. That’s part of the cycle. \n\nWe had the explosion, the drama, the perfect setup for her to garner more sympathy from her recycled manipulation-ship. \n\nI just can’t understand why she continued to call and text me the meanest things on Earth after all the drama was complete. \n\nI even asked her. Why are you still texting me? You got your blown out passed around cheater back. Why are you still texting me? \n\nI have a theory that the people in her life were telling her how she did me is messed up. Everyone that knows her knows that I did a lot of moving for her and I showed up for her. \n\nI have a theory that she lost control of the narrative which pissed her off.\n\nShe never quit being an asshole and eventually I had to block her. \n\nI have a very hard time understanding why after she got what she claimed to want, which is me gone and to get back with her coked out booty hole sales person why she would feel the need to stay in contact. \n\nNegative supply, I have read, but my mind would like it elucidated beyond “negative supply.” Why was she so angry during her own lovebombing? \n\nWhen she lovebombed me, she was smiling ear to ear all day long. She didn’t talk crap about her X really. We talked about getting married and having a baby all day every day. \n\nWhy did she need to text me things like “I wasn’t attracted to you, can’t stand to hear you talk” after she ripped out my heart and pureed it? \n\nI put my heart and soul into that relationship and she knows very well how much she was loved. \n\nWhy did she need to twist the knife for two agonizing months after getting her raggedy beat up looking recycled supply back? \n\nAs I was packing my things to go, she asked me for a set of crystal door pulls I bought. \n\nI told her “why don’t you ask stripperbitch?” And she legit looked like she hadn’t thought of it!\n\nShe kept repeating “our relationship wasn’t that long. This is my shortest relationship ever. I didn’t love you. Whatever we were doing here.” \n\nEven after 6 months it’s still pretty confusing.",

        "Text": "My birthday is coming up and I’ve been thinking a lot about last year. I had a lot of fun because it’s easy for me to block out negativity. My X pwNPD actually did put in considerable effort into my birthday. She rented an Airbnb so I could take a bubble bath. There was lots of Cava from Spain, my favorite. We went to the spa and got seaweed wraps. She took me to see West Side Story with a live orchestra. Beautiful! For dinner we went to a North African/Latin fusion restaurant. It was divine. \n\nI don’t want to diminish what she did. She spent her time, effort, and money on me and I am thankful that she had desire to do that. \n\nI can’t stop thinking about her faces. \n\nShe was extremely argumentative the entire weekend of my birthday. She was meaner than I’d ever seen her. \n\nI’ve seen a lot of videos since that time on how narcs ruin special events. It’s crazy to me. Why put in all this work and then be an asshole? \n\nIn retrospect I believe the obsession and infatuation had ended at that point. She barely smiled all weekend. It was like she was doing a chore. It was like it was bothering her. \n\nI had asked her just prior to that about if she was infatuated with me and if it had ended. \n\nOne night we were rolling around in the bed and she whispered in my ears “I can’t let you go.” I never asked her to elaborate on that. \n\nI knew what it meant. \n\nI remember going into the bathroom at that fusion restaurant and crying my eyes out. I already knew I was in devaluation, I just didn’t have the terminology or framing then. \n\nThe heartbreak from a year ago feels fresh. The relationship went on for much longer, but I think my birthday was when I knew I wasn’t being loved. \n\nI feel that moment really acutely. The moment where I figured out that not only was I not being loved, I was beginning to feel attacked. \n\nI was so deep in love, so deep in trauma, I didn’t know what to do. \n\nI was frustrated, so disappointed. So very hurt. \n\nI splashed some cool water on my eyes, and went back out to the table. \n\nShe didn’t notice. I knew she wouldn’t. \n\nAs we left the theater, a random visitor apoeared. It looked like an older masc woman came up to my X pwNPD and said “wow. Her coat. Her shoes, you sure are lucky.” \n\nI looked at my abusers face. \n\nGrowl, scowl, crossed arms. \n\nI should have known it would only get worse from there. \n\nI really wish I had walked away then. \n\nFor my ignorance I suffered greatly at the hands of my heartless and shallow abuser.

(quite a bit, might I add) \n\nGuess who blocked me and went radio silent after I showed him the receipts? He also claimed I like drama before all that but I wasn't the one who intentionally drew out something into a year long ongoing problem where I got told over and over that I owed him and I needed to change in order to \"get back in a relationship.\" \n\nWhat used to be a carrot he dangled now just seems so unappealing and gross. I'm sad I got to such a low level to where I thought it was an appealing offer, but I don't blame myself for it. I had low self esteem, I was at a low point, and he knew how to push my buttons. \n\nHonestly this mentally reassures me that I will NEVER find him attractive again and that no amount of convincing or lies will prove he has changed. His last pathetic and desperate attempt to get me is honestly making it easier and easier to realize his true intentions. It's much easier now for me to move on and nothing he says is going to actually reflect the truth, so therefore it won't get me like it used to. I don't have a guilt response or shameful feelings after seeing his true nature. It's kind of like my eyes have been opened and I gained a superpower of shielding myself from him and his bullshit. \n\n\nHis actions look pathetic, he's grasping at straws and doing mental gymnastics to justify himself, I've figured it out. I've seen him truly for what he is: pathetic and hopeless. Hopeless and pathetic. \n\n\nHowever, I wouldn't advise keeping in contact with your narc and exposing yourself to the mental and emotional torture of them finding every way to wriggle and worm out of taking responsibility. It's exhausting and only provides more evidence for something you already know but it's hard to accept. \n\nA better approach would be to write everything down and take inventory to help rationalize and center yourself in the truth, block and delete them and don't even think about getting justice or whatever it is you feel you need for closure because they won't ever change or take responsibility for their actions. I learned that both before and after I stubbornly interacted with him, giving him the benefit of the doubt each time and being disappointed every time by the same responses. \n\nThey don't change. Even if it looks like it, they just got better at hiding it.\n\nTruly hopeless and pathetic.",

That was what made distancing myself a bit difficult, don’t come for me.\n\nBut this solidified that I needed to get the fuck away from him. I’m going to try to make this short, but I probably won’t be successful at it. \n\nSO! We were sitting outside the job. We were silent until he said, “I don’t like women wearing wigs. I like women who wear their natural hair.” I just so happened to be wearing a wig, so I ignored his comment. He continued, “You need to stop wearing wigs. And the lens of your glasses are so big, no one can see your eyes. That would bolster your self-esteem.” \n\nLike, what?????\n\nI told him I don’t really care about what he thought about my wigs or my glasses and all he replied with was that he was just trying to help since I had low self-esteem and that I was mad for no reason or some shit. I wasn’t, by the way, as I said, I will wear what I want and be happy with myself. He tried to analyze my body language and tone of voice. Then his ride was summoned, but before he left he told me to “use my natural hair more often,” like I had such disdain for my hair. Ugggh!\n\nI was upset at that point. When I got home I texted him. Looking back, I had no NEED to explain myself but hindsight is 20/20, yeah? I texted him and here’s how it went.\n\nMe: sorry, but your “advice” wasn’t helpful. I don’t even get my hair done sometimes cause it’s expensive.\n\nHim: you could literally braid your hair for free if you have a good friend\n\nMe (a day later): and I’m happy with how I look\n\nHim: …. Good for you\n\nHim: you caring about what I think is utterly wild to me\n\nMe: I’m happy you went to “help” me but your unsolicited advice was not needed\n\nThe next few days or so, I did not speak to him at all. There were brief interactions. I even gave a way an extra soda for him, but other than that, nothing. He tried acting like we were cool, but I didn’t buy into it. I gave away that soda because I wanted to show him that I could be a good friend but keep playing with me, and I’m gone. Looking back now, that was weird. \n\nAfter about for or five drafts I finally decided to post this so….what do you think???! Comment below!\n\n",

I understand he has to feel like he as 'won' the break up and is out to hurt me as much as he can.   But it all still sucks.  I'm emotionally detached.  And emotionally numb.

        "Text": "\nSo my girl best friend also received messages from him, including screenshots of our private conversations, when he was trying to defend himself and tell his side of the story. She defended me and told him that kicking me out of his house in the middle of the night and treating me like garbage was so wrong, cruel, and inhumane. She also pointed out all the things he should have done instead so I did not get upset. She justified why I slapped him and even said any woman would do that after being called a whore and mentally ill.\n\nMy ex got mad and told her all lies defending his bad behavior, bringing up past fights and arguments we had. He blamed everything on me as if he never did anything wrong or never triggered me, and he claimed I have hit him many times.\n\nHe finished his messages by saying my bestfriend shouldn’t contact him anymore because he is so hurt and cannot take it anymore. He said he was sorry and never really wanted to let go of me, that I will always be precious to him, that he will never get over me, and that he is so broken and his life is in ruins and he is hitting rock bottom.\n\nI felt sympathetic after my best friend sent me his messages, mixed with anger, frustration, sympathy, and confusion. I wondered again if those things were all true.\n\nWhy blame me and defend himself again and then tell people he still loves me? Or whatever sadness he is going through?\n\nWhy can't he just take accountability for his behaviors and apologize properly?\n\nSomehow it felt good reading the last part of his message, and I was hoping he would truly say it to me directly. Are thise words even true? Did he mean ot? Is he really hitting rock bottom? \n\nI've been in no contact since May 13 and he is blocked everywhere. We broke up on May 4.",

        "Text": "Hello. I wanted to make a post because I'm not quite sure if my ex is a narcissist. He exhibits some behavior that aligns with narcissism, but I can't tell if the empathy and emotion that I'm seeing is part of an act or if it's real. Sorry this is a long one, bear with me.\n\nFor context, I am neurodivergent so it is difficult for me to identify certain feelings within myself and also to be able to identify if someone is lying to me. It took a long time to even admit to myself that what was happening was indeed abuse and not just a matter of circumstance. \n\n1) He has ridiculed my interests and appearance. For the duration of our relationship, he has made me feel bad about my hobbies, my interests, my fashion choices, my music, and he does it in very subtle and unassuming ways so I just started believing overtime that I was weird, and started feeling self conscious. When I would point it out, he would apologize and feel bad, but then it would slowly creep its way back into our conversations. In the car he'd find ways to tell me my music was bad or that the TV show I picked was childish. \n2) He has made me feel like an accessory in his life. Often times I've felt like I was a background character and he was the main character - where his interests and his life was more important, and mine remained on the back burner. When I listened to my music after we broke up... A bunch of his songs were in there, many I had memorized. When I look at the shows I watch, I would adopt his interests and he barely knew a thing about mine. He wouldn't have any of my songs in his playlists or any obsessions with the things I liked.\n3) He had a constant aura of irritation and anger around him, especially in our last months together. He would insist on seeing me despite ignoring my texts and attempts to communicate through memes or tiktok or anything. He would show very little interest in what I had to say and he would break out in arguments when we would finally see each other. At some point I said \"why am I even here? It's like you don't even want me here.\" And he would deny it and say it was because of something I did. And I would stay for a few days- and by the last day he would butter me up and make me miss him again, only to be discarded and ignored over text. \n4) He was manipulative, intentional or not. There were many times where I felt like I was going crazy or that my mind wasn't fully there or I shouldn't trust myself because he convinced me not to.\n5) I tried to break up three times. He convinced me every single time to stay with him again, convincing me that he was going through a rough time, that he would change. He would cry and tell me how much he loved me, how much I meant to him, and how he intended on changing. But we would always end up back in the situation where he is constantly angry with me and I'm walking on eggshells so he's not angry. \n6) Once I started focusing on myself, he started focusing more attention on me. In the months before our breakup, I had started going out more, detaching myself from the relationship, because being with him made me feel so drained and riddled with anxiety. Going out for nature walks, investing in my hobbies ... Listening to music alone, watching shows alone. When we finally broke up, he initiated the breakup, saying it was because of our incompatiblities. I started to begin the process of grieving and collecting myself as a person and all the things he's done to break down my self esteem. However when he saw that we were actually broken up, he began to panic, and made me a playlist (something he hasn't done since the start of our relationship) themed to one of my favorite shows of all time. He made a slideshow explaining each song and begging to have me back. I had to send pages and pages of texts explaining my feelings and why I couldn't be in a relationship anymore.\n7) Once I insisted on not being in a relationship with him anymore, he suggested we be friends. I was fine with this idea, but it quickly turned into something I didn't want. He would send me romantically coded memes, try to text me 24/7 as if we were in a relationship, and then when he got high, he accidentally started calling me pet names/complimenting me romantically. I got very uncomfortable and then eventually when he asked to hang out I said that I didn't want to/I wasn't ready yet (because I wasn't sure if he would uphold boundaries). He had a sort of anxiety attack, texting me nonstop that night, saying that he had been preparing this day for us to hang out (it had been my birthday that week and I didn't see him) and he was very disappointed and didn't know what to do with his feelings. He also admitted to me that he doesn't know what to do with this breakup and \"can't just turn his feelings off\".\n\nAfter that point, seeing any kind of message from him made me queasy and made me feel like I was going to throw up. The constant push of boundaries, the reminders of our relationship, the urge to get back together, the codependency that lingers between us... It all became too much.\n\nI told him today that I can't be friends with him after a week of requested silence. I'm not sure if he's going to uphold that boundary, but I just feel so queasy about the whole thing and I feel unbelievably alone. \n\nDoes this sound familiar? Or is this a different kind of abuse entirely? Please let me know your thoughts- I know this is no replacement to a professional opinion, but I have been through the wringer with mind games and manipulation so I just need some clarity I guess. Thank you for reading.",

        "Text": "So basically long story short I was in a relationship w a guy when I was 18 and he was 32. He wanted me to do many things I didn’t want to, including anal and threesomes. The threesomes were the worst, I said a million times I didn’t wanna do them until I said yes. I cried after our first one and he got upset at me for ruining his “threesome virginity.” He told me not to say anything negative, so I learned to lie to him, and eventually I would say that I was happy with the threesomes. (Of course I was not, and after the breakup he got upset at me for lying about it….but he had kind of trained me to lie by telling me not to say anything negative??)\n\nBeing an idiot, I cheated on him to get back at him — I slept with one guy (not 12 as he told everyone) and had very short text convos with several others, went on a few dates where no physical contact happened… all told there were 12 guys involved but most of them were literally just two text messages on an app saying “how are you”. \n\nAnyway when he found out about the cheating he was ofc very upset, as cheating is a horrible thing to do to anyone. He was heartbroken. He also beat me very badly with a belt and with his fists (we had had a BDSM relationship so it was consensual) and made me drink his pee, had me sleep covered in pee, took humiliating sexual photos of me to use as potential blackmail later, also wanted me to get tattoos of his name and even suggested a FGM surgery to close up my vag so i could only have anal sex with him from then on, to punish me. (I think he put the S in BDSM). I didn’t do the surgery. But I did—and accepted—everything else as I knew I was horrible for cheating on him and I felt immense amounts of guilt.\n\nAnyway this was many years ago but I had a dream about my ex recently and I talked about it with my therapist. \n\nMy therapist disagrees that my ex is lacking of empathy and he says that **he may indeed feel remorse**. I never saw any evidence of this. After I cheated on him I felt so much remorse I tried to end my life, but I truly don’t think my ex ever felt remorse for pushing me into threesomes, let alone for all the punishments he did to me after he found out about the cheating. \n\nShortly after the breakup I found a text written by him on a random forum, which he didn’t know I could see. He is lying in the text or maybe just remembered wrongly  because of all the trauma I caused him - for example, I didn’t cheat “since the beginning.” \n\n(I think he is referring to the time I slept with 2 guys over the course of the summer **before we became exclusive.** and he did the exact same thing— he slept with two girls, also separately, over the course of the same summer. The only difference is, he told me when I asked later, and when he asked me if I’d been with anyone else, I lied. Of course lying is very bad but does it make what I did cheating in retrospect? My ex seems to think it does).\n\nAlso, I didn’t go to sleep with the guy the day after I said goodbye to my ex at the airport — I had done that a few weeks before we even went on that trip, and then I self harmed immediately after cheating, but anyway, besides those details I think my ex’s devastation comes across clear in that text. He was CLEARLY shaken and hurt by how I lied to him and betrayed him.  I was always his “perfect object and slave” and he trusted me and then I blew that open.\n\nHere is the text post - https://imgur.com/a/IbinTJh\n\nMy therapist said that in that text, my ex is taking responsibility for his part in the relationship. Because he’s taking responsibility for having trusted me. And, because of this, it’s not a strong leap to assume that he may indeed be capable of remorse and of regretting the things he did to me.\n\nBUT. I doubt he is. Because, 6 years after we broke up, we did have a video call (which he threatened me into by threatening to release my nudes) and **I asked him if he remembered the violent beatings and what he did to punish me after I cheated. He had no memory of it.**\n\nNone. No memory of it at all. \n\nSo I disagree with my therapist. I don’t think that text shows ANY evidence of a capability of remorse or “taking responsibility.” To me — and of course I am very biased — it seems like he’s making himself the complete victim in that text. There’s no “oh but I also made her do these threesomes which I knew she hated” or anything. I don’t see someone who is capable of remorse or reflection, in that text. I see someone who is immensely hurt (understandably so!) and thinks he is the ultimate victim. \n\nPlease please tell me if I’m wrong. I don’t mind being told that. I just struggle to understand. \n\nMy second question is, I wonder if his new pattern of going after young girls (he seems to seek out 17-20 year olds now; he is in his forties) is actually a **trauma response to what I did to him**. You know how you can subconsciously recreate a traumatic experience and try to do it over again in an attempt to heal a damage that was done in early childhood? (Learned this from Dr Ramani) \n\nWell, what if his pattern of going after young girls (who look like I did then and have similar patterns like eating disorders, etc) is actually a trauma response where he’s trying to “do over” our relationship but get it right this time?",

If he had told me he rode a unicorn to work, I would not have doubted that happened even for a second. The point is, I think I have a pretty good bullshit detector and I was completely fooled for three years. (In retrospect, there were clues for months that stuff wasnt right, but nothing that prepared me for what was about to happen.)\n\nSo, the discard happens and it is brutal. Unfortunately, still not aware of what I’m dealing with, I play right into it. I apologize for everything, I cry, I BEG him to take me back, all of it. Only a few weeks ago (he discarded me at end of November) did I stumble across something that described Narc discard which made the pieces fall into place. His behavior was textbook. From grooming new partner, silent treatment, gaslighting, all of it. \n\nFast forward to now, we both moved to same new city. Lo and behold, i find out last week his house is two blocks from mine.  I can literally see his house from the deck because I live on the hill above him.\n\nI met someone last week who i hit it off well with, but now i’m wondering is this another one? Am I being love bombed again? Am i doomed to doubt the motives of every new person I meet? I mean, it took me three years last time to know and only when I was basically force fed the answer. \n\n",

        "Text": "The covert narcissist is a collapsed grandiose narcissist. The covert narcissist is sometimes characterized as a “quiet narcissist,” or a “vulnerable narcissist.” I am of the opinion these should be held as nuances of a covert. But make no mistake. I heard an expert call a covert narcissist “all four horseman of the apocalypse.” Experts on narcissistic abuse look legitimately afraid of coverts because hidden in the fray of their collapse are psychopathic, dark tendencies. While inside of a narcissist is nothing, the right elixir can transform a covert narcissist into a sight that legitimately strikes terror in the heart of therapists.\n\nIt took about two months before I started saying “I love drunk Squidward (my X pwNPDs childhood nickname due to her big ass head, nose, and terrible attitude).” I noticed very quickly that the covert mask dropped and that substances pulled out who Squidward really wants to be, a grandiose, full fledged, full of oneself superhero. \n\nIt is here where the childish splitting mechanism hurts the covert. Because people are either incredible or horrible, alcohol gives the covert wings. It’s because of the reasons of which you are aware. Alcohol lowers inhibition, long term memory. It also acts on your hippocampus, and your empathy centers. The narcissist already lacks empathy. In a drunken or drug fueled state, the covert will believe its own BS. Yes, I am grandiose! Yes, I can pull any person into my bed! \n\nThe covert is a lame. The covert is a goofy. The covert battles insecurity, envy, feelings of failure, body shame, and self loathing. The narcissist is by nature an addict. They are addicted to praise, narcissistic supply, and attention. The covert seeks this supply and unlike the grandiose, doesn’t fool themselves using their superiority complex into thinking they don’t need supply. Coverts deal with an inferiority complex and feign humility to trick people into believing they aren’t treading in a pool of cognitive dissonance. Even if a covert lacks self awareness, they know they are bound to supply because of their collapsed state. They know they don’t have the charm or charisma to round up supply naturally.\n\nThat’s where the drinks come in. You thought it was just your covert that drinks a lot and used drugs? \n\nWhen a covert drinks, that “I’m a dusty weirdo” that is their daily inner monologue subsides. The covert is constantly wrestling and at war with itself. The covert is constantly denying oneself and as such has a very poorly organized personality. In other words, they struggle with their sense of self daily. They say the covert likes random hookups because they provide a quick hit of supply. A fast boost. A fast reassurance that they aren’t the childlike failure they actually are. The covert gets plausible deniability from being drunk and gets to experience a temporary pause in that sickening, nagging “holy shit I’m a fucking loser” they fight with every day. \n\nAn addict by nature, coupled with a reprieve from their natural defense mechanism, plus the fun of being the grandiose they wish they were? How could they avoid drinking? If you were always struggling in the way a covert does and alcohol, a little blow, a little edible would stop it, would you abstain? \n\nMy Dad used to tell a joke. It goes:\n\nA man says to his best friend  *’you know why I drink? It’s because I hate myself. Why do you drink?’*\n\nHis friend replies *’the same reason you drink.’*\n\nThe man says *’oh, you hate yourself?*\n\nHis friend replies *’no I love myself. I hate you, too.**",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, so I went no contact with 2 of my friends who I think have been quite selfish over the years. I sent letters recently to officially end the friendships. \n\nI didn't really go too personal with what my gripes were to them. I'm still figuring everything out that I'm mad at. As for the friend that has emailed me, I felt I was under his thumb, he was more overtly abusive when we were younger, mean pranks, making fun of me in front of people, taking photos of me while I was naked (changing, showering etc), stealing from me plus more. Recently it's been more covert narcissist type stuff, it's hard for me to even say what it is, I just don't feel good when I'm around. It doesn't help that we gambled together and got addicted, I'm in Gambler's Anonymous now and starting to get better, I'm not supposed to associate with other gamblers anyway.\n\nHere is the email titled \"letter received\", I've redacted personal info. I just want to know what, if any, red flags you notice. I'll explain more in the comments if needed. The people he talks about losing aren't dead, they are an ex friend and ex fiance that chose to end the relationships as well. Here it is:\n\n\nHi James\n\nI received your letter this morning and honestly, I feel very sick and upset about it and I do deserve a chance to respond. As I’m sure you understand I have questions.\n\nFirstly, a response to how you think I’ve gone about things in the wrong way… the password resets were not a way of getting in touch I was genuinely surprised I couldn’t get in to Disney and thought I was putting it in wrong, it was only on the second time I realised what you had done. But of course you never communicated that to me. I was not ‘involving’ your family. You have to remember that we’re all sitting here for a very long time with no answers wondering how our friend is getting on and keen to see him, but being blocked with no explanation forces me to reach out to your mum and ask how you’re doing, I think about you all the time. So then after your mum said what she said I was thinking ‘ahh he’s really down, what can I do without seeing him?’ So I just sent some money and was saying ‘get a takeaway on me’. It was just a kind gesture from a friend to try and boost morale, because obviously I’m thinking what your mum is saying is true. So I don’t think the way you have gone about things during this time has also been that great, it’s been very confusing and unfair.\n\n\nNow, I don’t think just saying you don’t want to be friends with me anymore and that you think our relationship is toxic, and then not going on to say any of the reasons why, is so unfair. And that’s what’s made me feel quite uneasy tbh, what a huge blow to the gut. Toxic means very harmful or unpleasant, and so that’s what our friendship is to you? I’ve seen you have these types of friendships and never thought in a million years i would be on the receiving end of it. So, yes I would like a much better explanation than the one in your letter, I thought we had much more mutual respect and understanding. So what have I done? And what have I done so suddenly on wrestlemania week that triggered all of this? Because in my opinion, I think our relationship is very much on the opposite side of toxic, I find that all we do is laugh pretty much and that hanging out with you definitely takes the edge off a stressful or bad day and it’s something I look forward to. And I also think I keep you away somewhat from real toxic shit like drugs, and get you doing the things that you’re really good at. I do what I can to help always, you’re my best and oldest friend. And yes, you feeling like this a while without saying anything and feeling obligated to keep the friendship going definitely makes me feel sick. There was no need to be fake when you can just speak up. I’m definitely sorry that I’ve made you feel any of this. You can come to me about anything, like always, and the same from me to you.\n\nMy main concern will always be us, that we’re happy and healthy and having a good time.\n\nWe’ve been together our entire lives and have such a catalog of memories, saying goodbye to all this is really the biggest shame and would make me very sad. And therefore, I’m really hoping that you can reconsider? I mean, absolutely have whatever space you need but I do urge you to reconsider on throwing away 30 years of everything. From the bottom of my heart I do apologise for ANY wrongdoing that I have done in the last couple of years and just know nothing has been with intent or malice. I just don’t want to throw this away when it’s salvageable. When a relationship breaks down or has issues, you open up and talk about them, you iron them out and you move past it. And clearly that hasn’t happened here before chucking it away. So please reconsider and open up to me, I would of course make whatever changes I can in the friendship to save it. We can change what we do, where we go, how we act, how often etc. I honestly don’t mind, I’m just unaware what the issues are at the moment, but I would very much like to move forward and past this. While you do have a right to be left alone, I also have a right to fight for what I believe in and what I don’t want to lose and that’s what I intend to do, albeit in the right ways.\n\nObviously I have had a very tough year in losing a friend in (name) and losing (name) and I really don’t need to lose my best friend too. So please if there’s anything I can do, I need you. I love you man.\n\nTake care\n(name) \n",

I think my mum is narcissistic and abusive. \n\nSince I was 4, I've been hit with the hand/slapped or multiple random objects, yelled at, locked in dark rooms, been chased with a burning hot item to get burnt, been chased with an electric bat, had my shoes and clothes thrown out of the house, would get hit more because my mum claimed her hand hurt when she hit me, made to drink milk with ants, are among the physical harm I remember. \n\nShe'd often be nasty when I score a 17/20 instead of 19, call parents of guys in my class who were extremely violent and make a systematic plan to scare tf out of me, would call parents of children who'd fail and cry about how much of a failure I am, call the parents of top scorers and ask them what did they do differently to make their child score better, plan to drop me at my uncle's place (my uncle is extremely physically abusive and has almost beat his child to death) she'd plan to drop me there so that I get abused too, she'd cry and yell when I'd not draw or colour, sing, dance or play as well as my cousin, humiliate me infront of guests, expect me to thank her everytime she gave me food, milk or water I'd get yelled at or hit if I would forget, list goes on ngl. \n\nWhen I was around 10, I was forced into this music class and for pressured into taking part in reality shows. Both my mum and the music teacher were abusive and when my music teacher humiliated me, my mum would feel humiliated and abuse my physically and psychologically at home. I've never been allowed to go out and play as a child because I was always supposed to study or do co curriculars. \n\nWhile the physical abuse continued for 8-10 years, (edit: 14 years. Not 8-10. My bad) the emotional abuse extended post the same. I'm 21 rn and I'm not allowed to go out with my friends for more than a couple of hours once a week, not allowed for sleep overs, none of my friends are allowed to come home etc. The constant abuse led me develop a phobia towards anything competitive including exams. Even looking at a question paper makes me want to puke. I feel like fainting while studying. I've survived 7 ODs including one which almost took me to a state of coma a couple of months ago and God knows how many SH attempts since I was an 8 yo. I used to be a deans list student until 2 years ago but after that, something snapped. My anxiety makes me puke and faint before exams and i end up missing them. I ended up missing 19 exams over the past couple of years. All of which I should give before i graduate next year. I'm under 5 pills for severe anxiety, depression and OCD which make me physically exhausted. \n\nYesterday in the midst of a fight, among a plethora of things my mum yelled a couple of them went like, \"I wish you and your grand mum died\", you make me want to commit suicide. \"I will commit suicide just so you regret not loving me and to prove that something bad can happen to me too\" \"you are the one who's ruined your life. You don't have the audacity to take responsibility for it, which is why you blame me\". \n\nWhile I've told my father and sister about the abuse, nobody seems mad at her because she'd do it when I'm alone. And honestly since the time I left home for University, my sister is not the same person I once could confide in. My mum constantly cries and victimises herself infront of my sister giving her an impression of me doing something bad to my mum and making her feel the necessity to protect her. I genuinely feel lonely and I don't know whom to confide in. I don't think therapy is taking me anywhere and my partner gets very aggressive when I tell them and says they hope my mum dies. That's not what I want to hear. I probably need a bit of gentleness and acknowledgement because that's precisely what I've never received. \n\nI have an exam day after tomorrow and I'm just stuck with what she said yesterday. She doesn't even let me use the word abuse and starts crying endlessly the moment I confront her. But tbh I really don't think she has any remorse. I'm so worried that my bad academic record might get me stuck with her and the thought makes me sick to my gut and want to puke and pass away. I really don't know how I can help myself atp when even getting out of bed feels heavy and like a chore. Is this normal? Am I overreacting or something? Any words or suggestions would help. This is probably the tip of the ice berg. I don't think I can type out each and everything here. Is this all my life is/will be? Also, if I go no contact with her my dad and sister will probably go no contact with me and i genuinely love them. ",

        "Text": "I’m trying to wrap my head around what is going on but right now nothing makes sense, I feel like my reality is shattered. \n\nLast Sunday was the last time we spoke. He had just left my house. We were intimate. He told me his work schedule and that he was going to see me next week. For almost 10 years we had grown into adults, working on being better individuals and to each other, working on our traumas to trust each other. \n\nI vocalized over and over and over how if I he was talking to someone else, I was out of his life forever. He always said no. And that when we are together, laughing and joking and being intimate, that’s what reality was.\n\n I was not always perfect, but I was always honest. \n\nWe had a soul tie. We said we built up a strong connection over time, and within the last few years we said we loved each other. It felt like he could look right into my eyes and could read my mind just by a glance. I’ve never, ever, experienced this.\n\nSunday evening I get a call, and there is a girl on the other end. You can guess what our conversation entailed. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t speak, none of this made sense to me. He had been lying to me the entire time. We were long distance, and this broke my heart. \n\nI looked past the passive aggressiveness, self loathing, and took his suicidal ideations at face value because of how dark his childhood was. I knew he was insecure about his face, his body.. i know he hates himself. I knew he had anxiety, I knew he had depression, I knew he had ulcers from drinking so much. And now I know the reasons why.  Covert-Vulnerable..\n \nI gave him one night to explain to me, to saying anything to make me understand how he could just be at my home, in my bed, hours before this. To just absolutely obliterate everything we worked towards, everything we were..\n\nHe did not answer my text. I waited 24 hours and gave him a final call. My voicemail was not screaming, or crying, but I was harsh. He never sees me treat him that way.. I told him that he spins a web of lies and infects everyone around him. That he has to go to sleep at night knowing he is a coward. That I deserve closer, but he’s not a man, not an adult, not a person that can make a decision to save his life… that he said he loved me.\n\nThe videos, the pictures, the thousands of text messages just spin around my head. I do not understand how you can say you love someone and not only do something so cruel, but to completely ignore that person after. We promised each other we would never fight and disappear.\n\nIt makes me feel like he chose her. It makes me feel like I am not good enough. It makes me feel like none of this was real. How can you not even apologize.\n\nThe silence is louder than any words he could ever speak, and that is what hurts so badly. \n",

His stuff are 2 old shirts, 1 shorts and 1 underwear and 1 JBL speaker worth 180 dollars! And he even said weeks ago we can just throw it away.\n\nI mean, are you kidding me?

        "Upvotes": 36,
        "Text": " I made a post entitled “The Narc is Still A Damn Fool” where I briefly touched on the subject of how you know the new supply will get no better than you. \n\nThe narcissists image of themselves may be equally as important as the supply they get. I would argue that since supply is interchangeable for them but their image is the only thing they’ve built in their psychological and emotional landscape, it’s the most important thing to them. \n\nThe discard is an illusion. The narcissist wants you to believe that they hate you, they’re never coming back, and it’s all your fault. In most cases, all three of those things are false. Yet, the narcissist carefully plans their discard, carefully crafts the narrative, and enlists the new supply in the battle to destroy you, leaving you reeling and hurting. This pain allows you to accept culpability that doesn’t belong to you and primes you to believe the new supply is getting better treatment than you. \n\nDuring lovebombing, this is absolutely true. You’ve had your spiritual beating by both of them. Now you’re blast with stories from flying monkeys and social media images of them smiling. Revisiting your special places, doing all the things you talked about but did not yet do.\n\nHow in the world could you believe those aren’t hand crafted to hurt you? Yes, the narc is thinking about you. The narcissist is compelled by their disorder to destroy everything they get close to. Like a reverse Midas touch. Everything they are close to for any length of time will suffer. They are duty bound to tear up everything because their disorder will force them to. \n\nWhy? \n\nThe narcissists deficits are a defense mechanism for a disorder rooted in fear of abandonment. On top of that layer is shame, and guilt. These emotions are very harmful to a narcissists nature. That’s why narcissists need supply. They need good energy to use and fill those voids. \n\nAt some point in a narcissists life they realize they are not like everyone else. That realization is an injury they want to ward off. They need supply that is vibrant, whole, and good. They need a personality and an identity to co-opt because they lack their own. Unfortunately for the narc, they lack object constancy and whole object relations. They can’t see the nuance in anything and they can never be consistent. Everything is all good or all bad including themselves, and as soon as bad things happen, the offender is all bad. As soon as they are accused of anything bad, they feel all bad.\n\nThis is the etiology of their erratic, inconsistent behavior. It can happen quietly in a covert, or out loud in a grandiose. \n\nThat is the disorder. That is how you know your narc can do no better for the new supply. That is how you know that what you witnessed the narc doing to you: devaluing you, triangulating you, punishing you, the silent treatment, the hot and cold, the blame shifting, the requests for endless servitude, financial abuse…everything the narc has done to you is their defense mechanism against the childhood abuse and/or neglect.\n\nI know it hurts to see that Snapchat of them kissing on the beach. \n\nI know it hurts to see them eating that 150 dollar prime rib at STK. \n\nJust like the cherry blossoms inside STK, it is an illusion. It isn’t real. It doesn’t reflect real life.\n\nThe new supply will get no better than what you got. \n\nWhy would you be envious of an abuser? \n\nWhy would you be jealous of someone who treats others like shit? \n\nThe narcissist lacks empathy but the narc still knows nobody is jealous of that. They want you and their flying monkeys to believe that you were the problem and the new supply is the great love that is the answer to those problems.\n\nit’s not real!\n\nYou know the narc is a damn fool.\n\nEventually that narc is gonna narc.\n\nThe disorder will compel the narc to destroy it all,\n\nJust like they did with you. \n\nThen they will get a new supply that will be the love of their life,\n\nOr recycle an old supply who they’ve realized is the actual love of their life. \n\nSomebody is always the love of their life\n\nThey will be destroyed just like you were \n\nNew supply.\n\nThis cycle will go on \n\nUntil they are pushing daisies.\n\nThe end.

He had this crazy ability to make me feel so special/wanted but also fucking crazy. I used to go so mad for his love and he knew it. I’ve been through a lot of trauma growing up and have co dependency issues, he really latched on to this. This relationship had been going on and off for a year and a half, I forgot to mention he was my manager. \n\nAnyways, you all know how narcissistic behaviour works. When all of this came to light, it took me to the darkest place I’ve ever been, luckily I moved to a new office (same company) but completely separate from him. I couldn’t get my head around the versions of him he showed me, and the lies that he told me and my best friend throughout that time, still five months on I find it so hard to believe/process. When it was fresh I called him, I was the lowest and desperate. He was a different man, he told me this was all my fault and how I could get fired and people would hate me for ever telling anyone what HES done. Which sounds nonsense typing it but I really believed him, I tried ending my life that night. A week later I sent him an email admitting it was all me and I got myself into this terrible space, and that was the last contact in January. I’ve gone through so many phases of hating him, missing him, all of it. I can’t stop thinking about him, and finding it insane how any of this is real, I shouldn’t miss him. Because he did abuse me, and he took me for a ride and I hate it. \n\nI guess - I’m asking, how did you stop thinking about them? How do you start seeing them for who they really are? Not all the perfect memories? Not blame yourself for all the pain. Because I’m in that space at the moment, he’s all I think about and I want to break contact. I can’t for several reasons, I know I won’t but I’m constantly fighting that urge. I’ve been seeing a therapist which has been helpful, but I’m at a point where I need coping mechanisms or someone to tell me that eventually I won’t feel this way anymore. \n\nThank you for anyone who’s listened, and can help ",

I know I fucked up bad. \n\nI work as an assistant at a law firm and he is one of the lawyers. We work together many hours a week. I fell for him pretty quickly. He is a very classic narcissist and made me feel so good, would do special things for me and gift me with things he knew I would like. I am very nice and giving and I have always pumped up the ego of people I work for as I feel it’s part of my job, which I think made me an easy target for him. Months of emotional cheating, never physical as he is married as well, but dreams of us being together and me being delusional that he is the one I need to be with and the life I need to live. I fell hard and became addicted to him. \n\nA couple months ago a new assistant started. And everything shifted. He tossed me aside like I never mattered to him. Would tell me how much he liked this new girl and how she is completely his type (complete opposite from me in every way..). All the things that were once directed at me are now directed at her. He has even started gaslighting me and emotionally fucking with me intentionally. He ‘forgot my birthday’ after talking about it many times and he always does a big show with cakes for peoples in the offices birthday. I messed up by confronting him about it and asking him if he even cared about me. He said he did but I feel like that was a vulnerable mistake that gave him more power. \n\nAnyway. I can’t quit, this job is great for my career. I am around him 40-60 hours a week and I don’t know how to get over him when he’s right there. And the jealousy towards this new girl is hurting and adding so much more mental anguish. Any advice? ",

He knows what's best for her, he monitors her texts, spends every second with her...you know the drill.\n\nAnyway, this guy is a firm believer in the \"you can't have friends of the opposite sex in a real relationship.\" Well, back in January/February, I saw on his Facebook page that he had a new friend. A female friend. I thought maybe she might be the new supply. She's a few years younger, follows his \"professional\" Instagram page, etc. Then, at the beginning of May, my friend added this new girl on Facebook. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but if he has control of her phone I wouldn't be surprised if HE added her.\n\nDoes this sound like triangulation? If it is, what should be expected next?

        "Text": "Hello, I'll try to keep this brief but feeling that It might not be. So i met a friend a few months ago at work who i grew pretty close with and considered a best friend. We would hangout a lot and we live very close by. We formed a small friend group from work and I learned that she's heavily addicted to drugs. She would tell me very depressing stories and events in her life and bring it up almost every time we hangout as if it was a constant reminder.\n\nI've grown really attached to them and she is someone I considered a sister until later on. There's been a few chaotic instances when we hanged out that she say or do cruel and heartless things, some will say that it's the drugs but there's a growing pattern with her behavior. She would downplay other people's feelings or traumatic events, talk badly about our other friends calling them ugly, always acting as if she's the victim in every scenario or blame others for things that are entirely in her control. Sometimes even make excuses for certain things or lie just so she could either get drugs or a ride somewhere. Most of the time whenever I wanted to hangout or if she wanted to, she would ask me to take her somewhere first.\n\nThere's been several instances where she put my life on the line with her erratic behavior, some being death or imprisonment. She got mad one day and instantly cut ties with two of our friends from the group saying all this hateful stuff about them which she refused to apologize or acknowledge when i told her that they never said anything bad. She did a line of code in my car once and even in public with cops right by us, i brought this up stating that I'm not ok with this and she somehow switched it on me and trying to make me feel guilty.\n\nWe have shared traumatic experiences yet she keeps downplaying everything what me or others went through and always acting she went through hell and back. Even the smallest thing would set her off, it's constant eggshells around her. One of her ex-close friends stated that she's a \"master manipulation\" which I took with a grain of salt since he constantly stole and lied to others.\n\nI kept trying to stand up for her in the past trying to make excuses for her actions even though I should be furious with all the crazy stuff she put me and others through. Despite it all, i still love and care about her which is messed up. I keep reading that having these attached feelings could be trauma bonding which a lot of it does make sense. I keep wanting to help her with the addicting and have stayed over for hours whether it be at night or day making sure she ok or going through withdrawal. She's the first person in a long time who I share a lot of interests and humor with but I'm not sure who they are anymore. Almost as if they were just masquerading a false identity just to lure me in and use me.\n\nI keep wanting to help her and be a good friend, she ignored my last text where I'm just checking up on her and she's frequently posting on other social medias. All this chaos has took a toll on my mental health and even physical, I'm going to therapy soon but any feedback on this would be appreciated.",

        "Text": "Hi everyone, I need some advice please (my english is not very good because I m not a native speaker). \nI have dated a covert narcissist for a few months. I lived through the whole cycle and have been discarded. I went no contact but the problem is that he is lins of my « neighbour ». He owns the appartment he lives in and I also own an appartment in the same building,  but I rent it and i sometimes have to go there. So the probability of seeing him is high but not as high if I would live there. He also has his flying monkeys who live in the same building and they clearly hate me. \nThe main issue for which I am asking advice is that all the owners in the building are in a whatssap group ( to share info on the building). The narcissist and myself are in the group.\n\nThe relationship ended 3 months ago and he hoovered for a few weeks then stopped and tried again. I havent heard from him for a few weeks but I notice that it triggers me and I get angry everytime I see him on the whatssap group acting like the friendly neighbour. It annoys me more than it should 😔\n\nShould I leave the whatssap group. Or would it make him think that he won? \nAnd it would also make me miss out on possible important information regarding the building …\n\n",

        "Text": "The narcissist teaches you how to destroy yourself. Now that the narcissist is out of your life, you’re still hurting yourself using the illusions and dreams the narcissist has put into your mind. Into your heart. \n\nI’m not an exception. Even though I write about triumph, I still have hard days. \n\nMy ex pwNPD taught me how to hurt myself. How to beat myself up. She taught me how to break my own heart, and now I have to unlearn that. \n\nIt’s been a journey for me. It’s something I still struggle with in the aftermath of all this. Sometimes I think about holding my X pwNPD. About being the big spoon. Sometimes I miss her hugs. Then I let that go into getting angry about being abruptly replaced. Sometimes, both my good and bad memories of her lead to the memories of the painful discard. \n\nI know it’s an illusion. I understand the narcissistic cycle and everything. So what to do about my broken heart? \n\nI just remind myself that I was never loved. All the time she was nervous and trembling weren’t for me. It wasn’t cute or sweet. She was nervous about not getting her supply. She was nervous about how crazy she looked for dumping her ex before me abruptly. She was anxious about how she looked.\n\nIt’s been an important part of my healing process. \n\nOn the nights when I want to idealize her, or think about how much I loved her,\n\nTo remind myself that I was never loved. \n\nIt was all a ruse. A farce. And that I was used. \n\nWhen you see the narcissist rubbing the new supply in your face, when you get a hoover, when the narcissist shows up to pull on your heart strings,\n\nRemind yourself that none of what they do is authentic. None of it is real. None of it is genuine. Anything positive is done out of necessity. It’s all a means to an end.\n\nIt’s so sick. It’s so hurtful. It’s so vile. \n\nThat’s how I’m teaching myself how to unlearn the behavior of allowing my mind of drifting to some romantic place I was always in alone. \n\nWhen she started telling me she never loved me despite saying the exact opposite a week earlier, I chose to believe it. I have to remind myself of that. \n\nShe did acknowledge that she used me and that it was wrong. \n\nDon’t ever let them tell you they don’t know what they’re doing! \n\nI have to choose not to remain in a state of confusion and not hurt myself with hope or trying to decipher what she really meant. \n\nAccepting that the entire relationship was with a fake person incapable of loving anyone: \n\nThat is the version I am etching in my memory. \n\nI take a little solace in knowing that her recycled supply has been described to me by her and those around her as a horrible, volatile, unstable, angry person. She’s never done right by my X pwNPD or her family. Everyone with any knowledge of the situation knows that’s going to end terribly. Even she said herself \n\n“If it fails, it fails, but I have to try.”\n\nSo what about me? The only one of the three of us who is actually in love? \n\nMy best friend told me it was wrong of me to encourage her to go back to her recycled supply. \n\nThe petty in me did get a tickle out of it, but I always encourage anyone who hasn’t had enough abuse to go back until they’ve had enough (as long as they aren’t unsafe). \n\nI will remember the monster. I will remember the selfish asshole. I will remember the nights I cried before the discard. I will remember the time she was in our room telling me how she’s not a therapist and she shouldn’t have to ask about my feelings. I will remember that as I cried, the cat also cried with me.\n\nI will remember the robotic monstrosity with less empathy than a cat. ",

He told me not to contact his friends and family as per him I lost that privilege. \n\nI did not have any choice but to contact his relatives who live 4 hours from his hometown as i already felt unsafe. I asked them not to tell him or his mom and they respected my requests. They took care of me and ensured I was able to rebook my flight and was home  safe. When I told them the story they got so upset with my ex and literally ashamed of what he did to me. Thankfully they already met me a couple of times and know that Im a good woman and has her life  and business together before my ex. They hated the fact he kicked me out and disrespected me and treated me like trash. His uncle and relatives who took care of me are pretty much the most powerful in their family and his uncle is also one of my investors in my business. The only one siding my ex is his mom. Who knew what happened but let her son disrespect me and did not help me out in the cold.  His mom and my ex also never asked if I was safe when i left their town to travel 4 hours to the city knowing I had nothing by the way. Never checked on me which also made their relatives upset. \n\nI went back to my own country and after a few days my ex found out that i stayed with his relatives. He immediately called his uncle and asked what I told them, his uncle said nothing negative and still all good words about him. He just said we broke up because i hit him. Nothing more. \n\nOf course they already know the truth so they just told him to let me be since its over. \n\nHe sent me angry emails stating I am dividing his family with my lies whatsoever so they feel sorry for me and threatened me with so many things. I did not react to it. He then proceeded to send random messages to my family and friends. We thought thats done and he will stop and keep quiet after. \n\nDays after he randomly sent screenshots of our conversations to all his family and friends and my family defending himself, telling his own version telling them to stop attacking him as he still loves me and we were both wrong blah blah blah , nobody responded to the group chat  he even included a cafe manager in the group chat he just saw in a photo with me. His uncle just privately told him what he is doing is wrong and he needs ro stop bothering me.\n\nOf course the screenshots only solidified my narrative and my concerns and issues why I was upset with him that lead to the ugly fight. \n\nThe point of his Family and my family was regardless of the fight he should have atleast secured my trip back to my own country or atleast take me to the airport or train station. They said inviting me to his country then kicking me out like that is unacceptable. Even if the worst scenario is i cheated on him he could’ve at least have the decency to let me leave properly. They also said that him telling his side is too little too late and will not justify what he did.\n\n\nNow that he has an idea that his family knows what he did to me what will he do next? What is he thinking now? Will that make him realize things? Will he continue to plot against me? Is he mad at me? Will he continue to\n\nSorry I have so many questions. i am new to this and it happened only 3 weeks ago, May 4. So everything is still a blur for me.",

        "Text": "\n\nHi everyone. Sorry, I'm not sure about the flair, I'll change it if it's a wrong one\n\nFor context, I'm 27F, my mother has very heavy narc traits. She divorced my biological father and I grew up mostly with her and my stepfather. They also have a kid together who's now in his early teens. \n\nMy stepfather told me he witnessed emotional abuse from her on my little brother. What he describes is exactly what I've been through, but fortunately without the pretty serious physical abuse. My brother has been having some behavioural issues that I had too at his age and it's a consequence of what he's being put through. \n\nWe agreed to meet outside of their home to talk about this. It will be our first honest / deep conversation like this, my mother always got in a way of us developing a close relationship. Obviously the starting point is to make sure my brother is safe, but it's not all. \n\nMy stepfather has been emotionally abused since the start of this marriage. He might not realise it (it's a generational / gender thing, he was raised in a relatively patriarchal context), but my mother constantly humiliated, gaslit and took advantage of him. She always refused to work, she's 100% dependent on him. BTW, even if he's a really great father and loves his son, my little brother is the result of a baby trap (I know because I was like 15 and forced to be her emotional support in this decision). \n\nThe right decision for him would be a divorce. He doesn't deserve any of this. But obviously, on the practical side: mother didn't work for the last 15+ years, she has no practical skills, no qualification, no personal finances. When it comes to child custody, the courts are heavily biased against men and God forbid my little brother ends up stuck with her. It would be an extremely difficult decision, with a lot of guilt and very harsh consequences for my mother. She did it to herself, but it took me a lot of therapy and personal work to realise and accept that it's not my problem, my stepfather still feels responsible for her. \n\nDo you have any advice on how to approach this conversation? I know the question is vague, but am I missing anything that's specific to this kind of situation? If nothing comes to mind, feel free to share anything that might be even remotely relevant (also, just rant if you need to 😅) ",

        "Text": "Am I losing my damn mind? \n\nI figured I’d come straight to the source and gain insight and feedback that I may not have. I believe the person I’m dating employs a lot of narcissistic behavior on the regular… when questioned about a certain friendship that seems deliberately left out of certain conversations, his actions have led me to doubt that nothing exists in that friendship. \n\nThis person is a so called friend of the opposite sex who has been around over years and has recently been living overseas and returned last month.. the person I’m seeing discloses just about everything but had not mentioned that but, coincidentally, they had also made vague plans to go to his hometown where she currently is currently but had not told me about it… I just happen to have found out from overseeing him texting a friend that he was planning to go in May. \n\nA good friend of his ended up in the hospital recently which expedited said trip to his hometown (understandable) but while there, made the rounds of seeing everyone he knew.. the female friend included. \n\nHe mentioned the names of just about everyone else they saw but it was like pulling teeth for them to say that he saw her and minimized it as much as possible… which I don’t mind or care in the least that he saw her but I can’t let go of the fact that they didn’t mention it and there has to be a reason why. I tried to ask about the motives as to why he didn’t mention it and that led to shutdown and deflection, insults and then trying to steer the conversation onto me and “needing help” and if I’ve “lied” or “been unfaithful”.\n\nWhich I haven’t… what prompted the entire discussion is that I called him Thursday night after not seeing a text he sent me while he was in the hospital visiting his friend and when he responded, after 5 calls, he was short, not very communicative, hung up, and started prodding and what felt like he was picking a fight and acting as if he wasn’t by asking if I’d been drinking or anything to get me to pop off… I had just left dinner consoling a friend who lost her mom before I called him and found it strange that he wouldn’t answer and that the warmth from earlier was gone and dry. \n\nI started to wonder if that wasn’t a distancing behavior so that he could be unbothered while he was… doing whatever was convenient to him at the time and didn’t want me cramping his style.\n\nIt’s typical for us to snap each other before bed but on this particular day, he ignored mine and didn’t snap me back until the next day while he was in the car, but not while he was at the place he said he was.. which made me then wonder what it was that he didn’t want me to know or see. He claims he was with his friend and the friends girlfriend.. which could be true but there’s no documented proof or pictures to back it up. \n\nWhen he was visiting the female friend, he withheld that he was at her house and it’s up in the air whether the guy friend was even with him at all but I wasn’t doubtful about that to begin with, but I did begin to question later on why he didn’t mention being at her house in the first place because it’s behavior he would normally do.\n\nThe lengths to which he went to call me crazy, told me that I needed help, that I had trust issues, that I needed medication and to talk to my therapist… led me to believe he is hiding the truth about their relationship or his feelings for her and reasons for going to his hometown even more (aside from the other friend being in the hospital. \n\nWhen he reflected back to me what he thought I assumed, he said that nothing has ever happened between them and he wasn’t there to visit her or to try to date her or anything.. which were never words I said, but I did interpret his choice of words as the truth slipping and then I started to feel like I’m being used emotionally, a rebound and now he wants back because maybe things didn’t go according to plan and she wants nothing to do with him. \n\nI find the whole thing childish and dumb because I can accept that maybe he had feelings for other people before me but although I can work through that and understand it, I feel like knowing the truth is important here because if there was a slight chance that the day he was hanging up and villainizing me, what if something sexual was involved? I fear turning a blind eye could potentially expose me to a sexually transmitted disease, and I feel as if I need to be cautious and look out for my health because he didn’t seem above using my being open and supportive about mental health against me, and that behavior doesn’t lead me to feel that he would make my health a priority and protect it if it was a hinderance to him getting what he wanted (which could’ve been sex with her or anyone else).\n\nHe claims I question him about every single friend he has… which is false. I’ve asked about two of his friends.. one is male and a little flamboyant and is the one in the hospital, and the other one is her… I think that both the male friends had girlfriends at the same time and were possibly hiding a more involved relationship from the both of them simultaneously… which is totally f*cked but that’s besides the point.\n\nHe is prescribed mirtazapine (by the way) but claims he doesn’t know what kind of doctor he sees that prescribes him that medication and more or less acts dumb and says it’s only to help him maintain his appetite, not that he seeks help to maintain his mental health.\n\nHe shares his location with me and while telling me about his trip, mentioned he had no service randomly and would have to turn his cellular data off to connect to WiFi.. which isn’t required for wifi but I never asked about it any of it. I found it interesting that he mentioned it without me bringing it up and read into it as an attempt to nip any questions at the bud if there were going to be any about why his location wasn’t showing live for extended periods of time.\n\nMy description of all of this seems logical to me… he’s saying it isn’t and that I have issues and now wants to have a discussion to fix thing AFTER he had the entire night to himself, without responding to me and ignored me and is unbelievably hurt and upset currently because i read his actions as him not wanting to hear from me and now he says I’m “ignoring” him… does the sequence of event sound like he’s gaslighting me and just trying to find a way to get away with it? He has nothing to back up his story of who he was with, he cleared his phone of any trace there might’ve been and just wants me to “fix” things and accept that he has nothing to show me and that all I have is his word…. Which is inconsistent and unreliable a lot of times and he purposely hides things and accuses me of behavior that he says his family has done, which was an invasion of his privacy and it’s almost as if it’s beyond his comprehension that the facts of the situation at hand, do not fit the narrative he’s trying to portray and it feels abusive as fuck to me.\n\nI love him but I’m not sure I love him that much because I don’t feel he would even extend a fraction of the same consideration to me if I ever did something like that.\n\nI had a bad day the other day, I was very low and almost didn’t want to see another day and told him I needed him and his support and his response to me was distance, aloofness, pushing me away, refusing any sort of affection and when I mentioned how it made me feel, it turned into a heated conversation where he said “I’m not your f*cking momma, I’m not going to tell you what you want to hear. You had a bad day and making a problem isn’t going to make it any better. You’re the one that’s got the problem, not me, I’m fine. Idgaf if you want to pout and act like a child, deal with your own feelings and talk about it like an adult”… all of those are things I did. He invited me over to get a hug and stay the night… it was a 10 second hug and staying the night was me laying on one side of a bed with a barrier of pillows between us and minimal affection until he woke up and wanted to get off\n\nThere’s a night and day difference in how i interact and respond to him and his interactions with me… especially when we are resolving a conflict. It’s marvelous when we’re good, but as soon as he cu*ms, sometimes, it’s like I don’t even exist and my physical touch in a loving (not intimate) way is rejected repeatedly and everything I do is criticized to the point that I shut down and then his demeanor changes and he starts trying to be sweet again and then accuses me of wanting to create a conflict for not going along with the peace once he realized he was being a d*ck and has taken it to the point where I was being affected by it .. \n\nWhat is your take on this as an outsider looking in? I feel like he’s mentally abusing me, perhaps not maliciously but to maintain connection while he gets a pass to meet his needs in whichever way he feels entitled to. \n\nI have never gone MIA on him over phone while we were apart in distance..he on the other hand, did. And I just asked if he could help put me at ease by showing me proof he was where he said he was and with who he was and his response was “let me see your phone!”, before the questions of whether I was lying or been unfaithful or anything else along those lines started coming up.\n\nMind you, I’ve been his favorite person according to him… the minute the favorite person had questions now he wants to see my phone? It makes no sense. \n\nI’m standing my ground and obviously can’t count on him for validation so I figured I’d ask the group who could be honest and maybe provide insight based on your personal experiences of having gone through it or maybe having acted in similar ways, while providing insight into the motives and the desired outcome so that I may better understand where I stand in this “relationship” and if, flat out, this mf is playing me?",

        "Text": "I live in a duplex, and the upstairs neighbour has been a nightmare to deal with. I talked about her a few months ago in another post. She was trying to make me throw out her garbage for her. I now suspect she's a narcissist, or least really high on the scale. She has other stuff going on too that might be worsening it.\n\nI have spent the past few months ignoring her as much as possible. She, on the other hand, has been doing things to deliberately antagonize me. She will do things, then deny it when I confront her. She'll tell me to \"stop making things up.\" She will give a version of events that's clearly untrue. At first I thought she was lying. Now I'm pretty sure this is dissociation and confabulation.\n\nThings escalated to a point where she banged on my door while swearing at me. Then she threw a melon at my door. I have this all on security footage. Then she went inside and banged on the common wall while swearing. Then sent me some nasty text messages.\n\nI called the police. Then I emailed my landlord to tell him what happened. \n\nA couple days later, my neighbour texted me to ask if it was true that I called the police. She said she was sorry, blah blah. I didn't respond. \n\nNow she is trying to act all nice. Left me an apology note, which I appreciate. But she has been bugging me to talk to her. I have told her several times I don't want to talk right now. She claims she wants to keep things civil. But then she said \"you are dangerous for me because you push me.\" Which I think is bullshit. I am not responsible for her behaviour. All I am doing is standing up for myself.\n\nI got mad today because she keeps pushing me to talk when I said I don't want to. And told me she thinks I make things up in my head and that it scares her. That the neighbours think I'm weird. Projecting like crazy onto me.\n\nThen she talks about herself as if she is me. For example, she said she's been holding off on going to the police or to our landlord. Which makes no sense. She has been harassing me!!! And she also allowed her garbage to pile up on purpose, even though our landlord has told her not to do that. He has tried to evict her several times already. What on earth would she go to him for??\n\nOh, he gave her an eviction notice last week. I don't know why, but she showed it to me. And the notice lists all these things she has done. Stuff that makes her look really bad. But she didn't seem to understand how it made her look bad? Or I guess she thought they were all lies?\n\nI am looking into moving, but unfortunately there aren't many rentals available here. And it's hard to evict people here, so she might not leave.\n\nSorry this is so long. I just don't know how to deal with someone who constantly gaslights me, projects onto me, does weird stuff and denies it, and just doesn't make any sense. \n\nETA: she won't acknowledge what she did the night I called the police. She doesn't understand why I don't want to answer her questions. I told her I do not feel safe talking to her. She told me she feels the same way. Well then why does she keep messaging me asking me to talk?? \n\nThe police referred my neighbour to the mobile mental health crisis unit. They haven't called me back with an update  yet.",

I think initially I was blindsided by “growth from trauma” and “just trying to do what’s best for me and my kid” but that just seems like a fucking cop out to me. I only know one side of her story and her baby daddy “got strung out on meth” and dipped. I’m just really struggling with this because it feels genuine but sometimes feelings are too good to be true and I know I’m smarter than that. It’s a hard realization to come to man. Holy fuck. It sucks because I show her how I want to be loved and it’s just not reciprocated. I’m getting closer and closer to just snapping this line entirely.

        "Text": "Hi, I’m kind of at a loss so I wanted to get some advice on what to do. My best friend has been seeing this guy for about 6 months but these past 2 months roughly it’s been awful to witness and I truly believe he’s a narcissist.\n\nI thought he was a great guy in the beginning but then all of a sudden she began gradually venting about more and more concerning things he’s doing and it’s reached a frightening point. They’ve been on and off with him ending things abruptly blaming her for things he did wrong and manipulating her before blocking her saying things like “to think I was going to ask you to be my girlfriend tomorrow”. \n\nIt’s horrifying all of the things he’s done to see her go back to him each time since it pains me to see her settle for him. It feels awful since my sister was in a similar relationship a couple years ago and I was very vocal with her too about my displeasure of the significant other and how they should leave. I’m kicking myself though for being so pushy about him. He reads through her phone without permission and gets angry about what I say. So now she doesn’t want to talk about him at all with me and won’t keep me in the loop.\n\nI know I messed up and I should have just listened instead of giving advice but it’s so painful to watch my best friend go back to him every time. Now that she doesn’t want to talk to me I’m at a loss. It doesn’t help that her other close friend from college will go along with whatever she says so I know she’s telling her there’s nothing wrong with going back to him. I just don’t know what to do or how to help her anymore.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, I just hate being in this position having to wait for her to leave on her own since she deserves so much better",

        "Text": "Do me a favor and set aside your emotions for a moment. Consider the facts, reality. We dated someone who relied on manipulation to achieve their goals of securing narcissistic supply. When I was going through my discard, I wish I had someone tell me...\n\nTHEY CHOSE YOU BECAUSE YOU POSSESS QUALITIES THEY LACK AND DESPERATELY COVET. You're empathetic, kind, you're a light, positive, you exude love, emotional intelligence, healing energy... all attributes that are not only foreign to them, but also serve as a complete contrast to their own emotional emptiness- and it makes their deficiencies even more apparent. They crave the admiration and validation that naturally gravitate towards empathetic and kind-hearted folks like yourself. Your strengths and positive qualities became a source of supply for them, feeding their need for constant validation and superiority. Reality is THEY NEED YOU. Never the other way around. They do not naturally experience these attributes themselves. \n\nTHEY DO NOT CHANGE. NO MATTER WHAT IMAGE THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO THE WORLD. They will go great lengths to portray themselves as changed, reformed individuals, especially when they are with a new supply. They meticulously curate this image and broadcast it across social media for several reasons. The validation and admiration they so desperately crave. The likes and positive comments on social media feed their need for external validation. This façade they've created hides their true nature. By showcasing their supposedly transformed selves, they aim to deceive both their new partner and their audience into believing that they are capable of genuine change and healthy relationships. This façade helps them avoid accountability for their past behavior and maintains their image as this \"desirable\" partner. Punishing you is also entirely on brand for them. Narcissists often want their exes to see how WELL they're doing with someone new. They are going to flaunt their perfect new relationship all over social media to provoke feelings of jealousy, inadequacy, and regret in you. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS: New supply does not mean better, babes. Rather than changing themselves, they change people. This need to prove themselves to the world and ex-partners stems from THEIR insecurities. The new supply has not won some prize. YOU KNOW THE REAL THEM. They will put on a show as long as they think they have an audience. IT IS AN ACT. \n\nDEVALUATION-DISCARD. Narcissists are very black and white in their thinking. *Splitting* is an ego defense mechanism. It's a way for a narcissist to preserve their self-esteem. They do not have a developed stable sense of self. They view themselves as upright and admirable and view others as monsters if they do not conform to their will. YOU didn't conform. There’s good and bad in the world and narcissists believe they can’t overlap. Healthy people, you, understand that good and bad can coexist in a person. Narcissists can’t bring good and bad into a cohesive whole and that’s where splitting happens. People either stay on the good side, or they’re on the bad side, but they can’t exist at the same time. When you are being devalued, you’re seen as completely flawed by a narcissist. They have this way of making you believe you are the problem. Breaking you down. I'm here to remind you- IT WASN'T YOU. They have to devalue you as a person to feel better about themselves. It is an ongoing internal battle with themselves- a perpetual war with their own insecurities and desires. They are at war with themselves. I know, Discard hurts. But please understand this: The arrival of New supply does not signify an upgrade from you. It merely indicates someone easier to control and manipulate. Narcissists will always opt for the path of least resistance. You've unveiled their true nature, becoming less susceptible to their manipulation tactics. Understand that their insatiable hunger for validation and control means they will never be satisfied. It's crucial to realize: IT WAS NEVER ABOUT YOU. \n\nTheir dysfunction drives them to seek supply relentlessly, perpetuating the cycle of abuse. You escaped, thank God. It's not in the divine nature to deceive, confuse, control, and ultimately destroy others. Such actions align with a darker force's intentions, seeking to undermine YOUR light and worth. But you've defied those efforts. You deserve a love that pushes you closer to the Creator, uplifts, and ENRICHES rather than depletes your soul. May you discover the profound peace and genuine love you so truly deserve <3",

        "Upvotes": 26,
        "Text": "\nI am hoping that once you realize what it will take to keep the narc around, you will come to the decision that it’s too tall of an order and too much of a sacrifice to your well being. \n\nI was figuring it out real time. Once the initial shock passed and I had time to recalibrate, I was just like hell no, this woman is absolutely not worth me even trying this. I see now why she hates me so much, and now I even get a little kick out of the fact that she hates me. It means I turned into poor supply. \n\nThis is what it takes to be Grade A supply for a narc. Even doing all this won’t keep you from a discard, but you might be one of those who spends many years with the narc before they discard. \n\n1. Have no boundaries. You must say yes when expected to. The narc must be your master, ruler, and your overlord. \n2. Make the narc your leader. You respect the general like you’ll get court marshaled if you don’t. What the narc says goes, no push back, no pressure. \n3. Be an endless giver: the narc is a user. The narc is a taker. Allow yourself to be used. Let the narc be the potter and you be the clay. If the narc wants breakfast and coffee, make the best recipes you have. If the narc wants special things in the bedroom, give the narc that. But only when asked. If the narc wants your money open up your coffers, if the narc wants to vent about how unfair the world is, listen and nod only. \n4. Don’t offer intimacy: the narc has a personality disorder which makes being loved deeply, which requires empathy, a threat. The narc wants to be in control of his internal object and you can’t threaten it with a bunch of “I Love Yous” and “Why aren’t we Boinking?” Allow the narc to decide how intimate you’re going to be and when (this will result in your emotional starvation, but you say you want this narc and this is what it takes).\n5. Provide your narc with side supplies: look past cheating. Look past flirting, infidelity, and slights. Encourage the narc to do what comes naturally to a narc. Be the best side supply you can be. Don’t challenge the other supplies (friends, coworkers, etc). Step aside when they slurp up other supply. \n6. Never criticize the narc: the narc is perfect. The narc is never wrong, the narc hates to be criticized. Criticism is like a narcs kryptonite. They can’t stand it and this is a common reason for the ensuing of devaluation. Tell them they are always right, don’t ever challenge them, even if they are dead wrong. \n7. Accept that you aren’t a person: in the narcs delusional world, the narc is perfect. The narc is the most beautiful and the only good object. Everyone else is bad, out to get the narc, out to challenge the narc. If you’re being idealized, it’s because you are an extension of the narc in their mind. The narc’s inner landscape is very envious, and the narc likes the qualities you have. As long as you idealize the narc and pump the narc up, you’ll remain an extension of the narc. But that means you aren’t autonomous. You aren’t independent. You are essentially an extension program in  another body, but also the narc him/herself. When you criticize the narc, disagree with the narc, you break down the fantasy that shields them against the real world where they are boring lame ass losers. Keep the fantasy going for the narc where the narc is perfect and God like.\n\nIn order to be Grade AAA supply, you’ve got to minimize yourself and allow the narc’s delusions of him/herself become your religion. You don’t question your God or go against your job. You don’t say “I think you should…” who are you? The subordinate. You don’t know anything unless the narc says you do. \n\nSounds extreme? Anyone who is close to the narc and is a supply of the narc is following these rules because this is what the narc requires. The narc is nudging you towards total submission. When you push back, that’s where the fights occur and then you become the enemy the narc hates and wants to destroy. \n\nYou can slow the process down by becoming a complete zealot of the narc and total enabler. \n\nThe narc may marry you and keep you as the main supply for many years. As long as you don’t respect anything in return, you’re good to go…until you’re not. \n\nYou’ll still be discarded at some point, but at least you lived life with someone amazing, right? \n",

        "Text": "Part 1\n\nHi! Im kinda new to Reddit and I hope I can convey this story as well as possible. I worked with this narc I’m about to mention. We worked alongside 10 other employees at the warehouse part of a newspaper company. From the start, I should have been aware the type of person he was. So, I’m about to briefly share all of my experiences with this person.\n\nI was kind of having a difficult time at the job. I admit I was moving slow, not stacking papers right on the pallet jack. For me, on a job it takes a bit of time for me to do the job if I want to do it right. So, this guy rudely got in front of me right as I was about to lower the pallet jack, and I told him, “Sorry for being a bit slow, but that was rude of you to do.” I told him that it was a bit hard on the job today. He apologized and said he would be able to help me since he was a quick learner and I wasn’t. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks later, we exchanged phone numbers. I discovered he was a gamer, just like me and we talked about the games we like to play. We goofed around at work sometimes. He helped me with getting my job done. One thing he told me was that he was a bit self-absorbed and sometimes people call him a narcissist. That was a red flag that I should’ve seen coming. We were talking one day and he asked me what I thought about him. And I offered up positive things about him as a person. \n\n“No, I meant physically, what was your first impression of me?” he asked. I found it odd that he would ask me that, but I told him he was a good looking dude. I made the mistake of noticing some prominent aspects of his physicality though. \n\nI got too comfortable and said, “The one thing I noticed was your teeth. They looked a bit funny.” He wanted me to elaborate. “Oh, no, I didn’t mean it in a bad way. They aren’t raggedy or anything. They are perfectly straight, but the rows are different.”\n\nI tend to notice physical things about people, good or bad and maybe this time I put my foot in my lotus with this. I didn’t realize it until the next day. \n\nWe greeted each other normally and began working. I counted the papers and stacked them on the conveyer belt and he stacked them on the pallet jack. We talked as normal. But then, he brought up the fact that I said his teeth looked funny. \n\n“You have no right saying anything about my teeth!” he shouted. “With how you’re dressed. You don’t even take care of yourself.” He said many other things that I can’t remember but he  had me upset. One thing he told me that stood out was he told me I talked like a child. \n\nIn my head, I thought, Normal people wouldn’t react like this. They would tell me right away if I said anything to offend them and not make like things were good. They would stop me right in my tracks because I know I can say some offensive stuff that I thought was harmless. \n\nThis is part 1. What do you think so far??",

        "Text": "I've been seeing so much misinformation online lately, and I'm sick of influencers with NPD saying crap like \"narcissistic abuse is ableist\" etc.\n\nMuch of this \"debate\" (there really is none in psychological circles) I feel stems from a narcissist's tendencies to advertise themselves. Rather than admit fault, they simply claim that they're too mentally unwell to be decent, using their \"charm\" and \"charisma.\" (Especially when it comes to social media and younger generations.) They are so shameless about it that people think, \"yeah, it really must not be their fault!\"\n\n(This is just the dunning-kruger effect at work. Uneducated people believe themselves to know more about a subject, causing unfounded confidence, confusing others into believing they are more competent than they really are.)\n\nThe research shows that narcissistic people are capable of cognitive empathy, and rather than use it to be a decent person, they instead use it for manipulation.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10097942/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10097942/)\n\nThey are *not* stupid. They just know that pretending to be incapable of understanding and redirecting blame onto you works. They willingly choose when to empathize to breadcrumb you into staying.\n\nIf you are the one who's constantly blaming yourself, constantly brainstorming ways you might have been wrong, you are not the one at fault! That's their manipulation at work. Whether it's intentional or not doesn't matter. Harm is harm. If they have a habit of *accidently* running people over every time they drive a car, maybe they should stop driving! \n\nMoral of the story- don't listen to anyone who tries to claim that \"narcissistic abuse is ableist\" etc. They are uneducated and honestly embarrassing themselves! The fact that they choose to ignore victim's feelings on the matter says everything I need to know about them.",

Escalates to an ugly fight. He calls me names and verbally abuses me, calls me a pyscho and mentally ill, i slapped him , it became a super toxic fight he doesn’t want to let me out, pushed me around, i kept defending myself, trying to get out of the room so you i breathe and stay away, he threw and broke my phone and all my stuff all over the room, he got so mad when i slapped him\n\nthen He kicked me out of his house at 1am wearing almost nothing  at 8 degrees temp. It was freezing windy cold. I had no jacket. And i wandered around unsafe like a homeless person for hours almost harassed by a stranger with literally nothing on me. I had to get warm from a stranger’s car. After hours i went back to his place and pack my stuff , he was sleeping and then woke uo and was asking me to get out of his room. I packed whatever stuff i can and left. His mom also did not help me immediately. \n\nDays before our fight i saw white powder whatever substance that was with straw and his card on a pl-te. He drinks too much too like a lot frequently. \n\nThe minute i left he immediately messaged me said the he was sorry it ended like that but what i did was unforgivable and unacceptable. Etc \nHe was portraying me like this psycho person that just hit him slapped him and abused him out of nowhere and he was absolutely doing nothing. He said i have my demons blah blah that..\n\nI am traumatized and started reading and researching about the red flags and his behaviors the past 11 months. The lovebombing, the excessive drinking, the manipulation, gaslighting, going out on his own to drink until morning with random people leaving me to myself esp when im upset, using my weaknesses and past trauma against me, his weird relationship with his mother like the literally talk almost everyday for hours and whatever topic., the lies, the push and pull, the no change in behavior no matter how many times i tell him what makes me upset, the fairytale promises, the erratic behaviors, thought he was being generous but only when it benefits him, lacks empathy, he intentionally triggers me, does not respect my boundaries, or when i need my soace ,  \n\nPrior to me visiting him in Europe, i remember breaking up with him back in Feb and March because i keep telling him I can no longer take the no charge in behavior and he keeps doing the things I hate or not doing what I ask him to do as simple as call me first before he goes out w his friends but he said sorry and said he will change and that’s I went to him to also make up for everything and try to save our relationship. \n\nToday is the second week since I left his house, and i got a message from him letting me know he will send a box of my stuff next week.  (clothes, books, etc i left and didn’t get to pack) . He also asked when he should expect his stuff sent as well. His stuff were intentionally left him like his old xbox , jbl speaker, super old laptop, thats it. Should I respond to him? How do I recover from this?

        "Text": "So I've (35m) been with my partner (31NB) for about 10 months now (we've known each other for close to 8 years), and besides the first month or so it's been very unstable. I've never been in a relationship where I've experienced any kind of instability and constant arguing like this before, and when it's happening it's extremely confusing and exhausting. I should also say that I have had self esteem issues most of my life despite being kinda above average in appearance, and often have a hard time speaking up for myself.\n\nThat most common pattern I've noticed is arguments will frequently happen because I believe they are speaking to me in a way that a parent or teacher would scold a kid, and they believe that they aren't speaking in any kind of way at all \"just asking questions\" is often what they will say, or they'll accuse me of requiring a \"female bodied person\" of needing to speak to me with a cherry demeanour all the time. They call me names like nobody has ever called me before \"fucking stupid\" is a popular one, they have also told me that they hate me on several occasions, and when I tell them I don't like it they tell me that they don't feel bad about it and have also excused it by telling me that I made them mad. \n\nThey'll berate me like a child if I make a mistake doing chores, and if I take issue with any thing that they say while they are insulting me, mind you it would be to tell them that they are hurting my feelings in a very meek way, the argument escalates very quickly so I've learned not to say anything. I feel like I'm losing more of myself everyday, they need me to wait on them constantly, rub their feet, their back, make them lattes, bring their water etc. I'm naturally a very nurturing person, so I don't usually mind, but any time I want say like a foot rub, they seem to make it a point to give me as little attention as possible, they'll keep one hand on their phone and continue scrolling while like absent mindedly rubbing my feet for a minute or two before they go back to scrolling. But they demand my full attention and will get fussy with me if I don't get massage oil and give them all of my attention and effort for every massage. \n\nI often feel very touch starved and emotionally abandoned with them, they'll spend hours on their phone every night and I have to beg them to give me attention and again it's always extremely one sided (I have to cuddle them if I want to cuddle, it's never them touching me when I ask), if I tell them I'm lonely they'll just say \"me too\". I've caught them flirting with other people on IG and asked them about it and they told me \"It's just 'homie flirting\" and I didn't know what that meant, and they explained to me that it's very normal to make sexual comments and \"jokes\" about having sex with each other \"but never acting on it, so it's okay!\" because they live far apart. They kinda love bombed me at the beginning of our relationship and it felt good so I went along with it, but it's been months since we've been in a phase where they show me affection a lot, it used to be every couple weeks they would be obsessed with me for a couple days. Just tonight I was asking for some attention and asked if they wanted to cuddle and they said \"If *you* want\" and I said, \"Well I want to know if you want to cuddle\" and they said \"Ok\" and then got upset when I didn't cuddle with them, it seems like they can't even admit to me that they want my affection even if they do, it feels like that even the admission that they like my touch is them ceding control to me in some bizarre way that they can't verbalize or aren't aware of. They also were very pressuring about us getting engaged (that's not to say that I regret it or don't want to marry them now), and constantly \"forget\" to wear their ring to work, and I know if I said it hurt my feelings it would cause an argument, I can already hear them \"do you know how fucking stupid that sounds Matthew?\"\n\nThings haven't been good lately, but there was a stretch of time for a few months where things were stable, but even during our little arguments they get this voice that they claim is just them speaking, but I have not heard them use with any other person before, and it's very intimidating and belittling, and I can feel my heart race and my anxiety goes through the roof. But they claim I'm imagining it and just traumatized, and I really start to believe it really is my fault and that I'm crazy and a bad person for thinking they were upset with me. \n\nThey also say really out of pocket things to me that they tell me are jokes, but wouldn't be funny to literally anyone on the planet, and honestly I think if there was an audience to them they would feel embarrassed to have heard it. A couple of weeks ago we were getting ready to go somewhere and asked which hat I liked best, and I picked the \"boring\" one, so they said \"You look milquetoast.\" with a straight face, no mirth whatsoever, and when I reacted they told me it was a joke. It's like I insulted them somehow by not picking the slightly different hat they preferred as on option, so they had to take a dig at me. They do this every couple weeks, making little needling remarks when we're otherwise okay that do way more to erode my self worth than anything they've said to me in anger. \n\nSometimes I truly believe they fabricate an argument in the morning, and I can't figure out why. We go to work at the same time, and they'll wake up in some kind of way and just nitpick every little thing I do. So much so that it feels like even breathing around them is upsetting. Last week they literally yelled at me for saying \"babe, did you grab your croissant\" as we were leaving the cafe in the morning. Sometimes it truly feels as if they loathe me and every move I make is seen as ungraceful and annoying (something they've also said to me), my voice is grating, etc. It makes me feel so devalued, especially when my feelings and demeanor towards them is so consistent and only deviates at all when we are actively arguing. \nThese morning spats will continue after we've both left for work with them sending me a barrage of texts calling me names, insulting me, blaming me for everything, etc but as long as I drop it and let them tire themselves out, by the time lunch rolls around they want me too stop by their work for a kiss and a cigarette break. \n\nI feel so sad, unloved, valueless, and like a different person from when me starting dating. My sadness and fears when expressed to my partner without deviation will always start an argument, it seems no matter what way I gently try to bring them up, and by the end of the discussion I invariably realize that I was just being selfish for sharing my anxietys with my partner. They do this thing in every argument where they grossly misrepresent what I'm saying in a way that makes my intentions seem very malignant, and I find it very hard to believe that they genuinely think that what they are saying is what they believe. \n\nI know the solution is to leave, but I honestly am not in any financial position to be able to, I would have to quit my job and move halfway across the state to live with family. I guess I just need someone here to tell me that I'm not crazy and worthy of love. It's so hard right now. \n\n(Deleted and reposted this on a throwaway account)",

Done in a very clever and also quite subtle way which is why it took me so long to understand. My narc is a psychotherapist. You can imagine that made it very difficult for me to have discussions and arguments with him. I was gaslit, manipulated so badly. \n\nThe more I educated myself on this topic and spoke with my therapist, more and more moments from the beginning of the relationship to the end flash into my mind and it all resonates so much. I am certain that this was emotional abuse, I am certain he has this disorder. It’s so strange, I really think he did it all subconsciously, there’s a big part of me that thinks he actually means well? He lives in a distorted reality. That’s why when I had the realization after back and fourth emails of me trying to tell him to leave me alone along with some reactive abuse from my side which I of course felt guilty about later and always get made out to be the one with an anger problem.\n\n I felt the need to send him the most diplomatic email I could, explaining to him that I think he has this disorder and named all the patterns etc etc. He of course came back with a cool, calm and collected response weeks later that was laced with more blame shifting, gaslighting, guilting me,  etc etc. Making me out to be crazy and heartbroken and saying that I need to make him out to be evil to make myself cope with the breakup and the fact that he moved on instantly. He told me, the disorder doesn’t exist anymore and that I’m being discriminatory to people with mental illnesses.\n\nNow when I see an email from him I delete it straight away. I have a full body anxiety reaction and then stir over and over all day. I have a broken spirit, I feel like I don’t enjoy anything anymore, I want to feel like my normal carefree and happy self, for the past two years that happy carefree person has slowly deteriorated. \n\nI can not forgive him for this and won’t. At the same time, there is a part of me that is desperately wanting him to realize and get help. I want the acknowledgment, I don’t want him doing this to someone else. Is it crazy of me to think that I could maybe get through to him by calling him out and following through with no contact? ",

This is my first time dealing with one, I’ve only met the obvious kind. This is also my first time being in a relationship with one.

Everything is perfect in their home then, right? \n\nWrong. \n\nDo you remember how you gave your all to the narc, and once you started being devalued, you heard about their ex until you were ready to explode? \n\nTriangulation isn’t only to coerce you and to demean you, although it’s for that as well. The narcissist is lazy. If they have a multi pronged weapon that’s like catnip for them. \n\nThe narcissist has an obsessive nature. No matter the subtype, they have a constant battle within. Am I good enough? Am I failing? How do people see me? Do I have friends? What do they think of me? What do people think of my gf/bf? \n\nThat is why you saw the post of the toe ring the narc bought the new supply from volcano divers in Hawaii. \n\nIt’s to maintain their image, so they don’t look nuts given the fact that they had a messy discard, and to hurt you. \n\nFor a narcissist, each of their exes they’ve completed their full cycle on goes on a shelf. Kind of like an Emmy for an actor. \n\nEach Emmy is very meaningful. The narcissist loves the clout they get from talking about how they won the Emmy. They love to puff their chest out and name drop when it suits them, or zoom out and trivialize them to self aggrandize when it suits them. \n\nWhen you cut the narc off, when you go no contact, when it’s clear you no longer GAF, the narc feels like a burglar has crept into their glass trophy case and stolen one of their Emmy’s. \n\nThey do think about it. They do want that Emmy back on their shelf,\n\nBut if they can’t get it back up on the shelf, \n \nIt’s okay. They have more on the shelf.\n\nThey act so damn well,\n\nThey are sure to win more next awards season. \n\nAt the next Emmy Awards, they’ll brag about how many they won. How fun it was. \n\nSo when I say they think about you, it may not be in the way you want. You are objectified, and stripped down to your qualities. You’re reduced to what you can do for the narcissist. \n\nIf they don’t win at their narc-ing, they will go back to their trophy case and hoover the one that has what they want at that time. \n\nI’d honestly rather just be forgotten. \n",

        "Text": "I've been out of my narc relationship for several months (half a year!) now, and am still having minor flashbacks to things that I feel I should have seen as signs. I'm not blaming myself in an unhealthy way, but I think having the thought of \"I should have noticed that\" is pretty common. Anyway, I've been dwelling on one element and I just asked good old ChatGPT: \n\nIs this a potential sign of narcissisms; increasing emotional dysregulation when faced with flat emotion? Example, if one person is raging about some issue, and they are met with a calm, even demeanor, and so they attack that demeanor as \"not caring\" \n\nAnd received this response: \n\n  \nYes, the situation you described can be indicative of narcissistic tendencies, particularly in the context of emotional regulation and interpersonal interactions. Here’s a breakdown of the dynamics involved:\n\n1. **Emotional Dysregulation**: Individuals with narcissistic traits often have difficulty regulating their emotions. They might experience intense emotional reactions and struggle to manage these feelings effectively.\n2. **Need for Validation**: Narcissists often seek validation and affirmation from others. When they express strong emotions, they expect a corresponding reaction that acknowledges their feelings and perhaps validates their perspective.\n3. **Perception of Indifference as a Threat**: When someone responds to their intense emotions with a calm or flat demeanor, it can be perceived as indifference or dismissal. For a narcissistic individual, this lack of emotional mirroring can feel invalidating and provoke a heightened emotional response.\n4. **Attacking the Calm Demeanor**: In response to perceived indifference, a narcissistic person might escalate their behavior, attacking the calm demeanor as \"not caring.\" This can be a defense mechanism to assert control and force the other person to engage on their terms.\n5. **Projection and Manipulation**: The narcissistic individual might project their feelings of insecurity and inadequacy onto the other person, accusing them of being unfeeling or indifferent to manipulate the interaction and regain a sense of control.\n\nI'm posting this here because it came up in my former relationship, and didn't dawn on me as an abnormal response to composure until I had a client (I'm a counselor) do the same thing, which made me realize how genuinely strange it is to have someone become more agitated and upset when faced with a composed demeanor.  So hey, if this is happening to you - take it as a sign! ",

        "Text": "Unfortunately my no contact with Nex was rudely interrupted once I completed one month mark. I have blocked all his accounts. Unfortunately he found a way to call me using No Caller Id that surpasses his blocked number. He went on talking, apologizing, crying, blaming me, asking me to keep talking to him atleast once per day. I felt bad. But I remained strict. I told him to see therapist, tell his friends his emotional state and about the breakup which he hasn’t done still. The only reason that I’m getting these calls after 1 month mark is because now he’s back to living alone in his apartment as his friend who was staying there just left 2 days ago. It makes sense.\n He’s calls go from. “Tell me everything that I did wrong” to “Please stop blaming me I can’t take it anymore”, then from “you were right about everything like him being emotionally manipulative“ to “because of me you have made such progress” then “please keep talking to me because I’m not able to sleep” “support me to get over you by talking to you because you have done it so well”. Well I know, it’s my bad to have talked to him for so long. \nLiterally talking to him and his manipulative words takes my progress backwards. I have told him that for my own sake of mental wellbeing I will not be picking his calls and please reach out to his friends and therapist instead. Of course he wouldn’t respect this. I found a way to silence the No caller Id calls but not block yet. So I see the missed calls. It’s seriously disturbing. I feel guilt and bad for him too. Because he doesn’t have capacity to process emotions. I know it’s not my responsibility either, after all that’s happened. Somewhere I’m scared how he’ll be able to deal with all this especially living alone. But I know I would only go more into the pit if i keep letting him get to my head.\n\n Unfortunately every single word from his mouth affects me and I have to keep him blocked.  Conversation with him leaves my brain foggy. It really hurts to leave someone you loved in this condition, after all the moments we have shared, promises made and some of the good stuff he’s done for me. But There’s just no way for this one. Hope I’m not the AH to ignore his calls which could be potential pleas for help and redemption in order to protect my peace.  \n\nI feel like how can we block another human out like this as if they were an insect. Then I feel that insect is a poisonous scorpion. And this is a true test of my selflove and self preservation to decide will I let the Scorpio bite me piece by piece until i m no more or will I never let that Scorpio near me. ",

        "Upvotes": 18,
        "Text": "There are myriad reasons a narcissist doesn’t offer closure. I will go over two of them but there are many others. Each subtype is unique as well and may offer more nuances than are outlined here. \n\nThe discard is one of the four parts of the narcissistic abuse cycle: lovebombing, devaluation, discard, and hoover/reidealization. The discard is very hard for most victims to wrap their mind around. You’ve been cheated on. You’ve been hurt. You have found out the person you thought was the love of your life and everything you’d been waiting on isn’t even a quarter of that. You’re bewildered that someone you love to pieces and would do anything for has abruptly disappeared from your life or treated you so bad that you have no choice but to. \n\nSo now what? Will (s)he leave me forever now that they have their new supply and have told you how much they’ve despised you and everything you stand for? \n\nOf course not. Not without playing the discard out. \n\nThe narcissist leaves you in a painful way. Sometimes they let the mask fully slip and cheat on you openly. Sometimes they ghost you and run off blocking you. \n\nEither way it occurs, it’s based in the narcissists need for control and aversion to shame. \n\nShame is one of the few things that hurt the narcissist. Controlling the narrative gives them the sense that they are in control. So if they lose control during the discard, that’s when things will get scary. Protecting their precious image of themselves and others is of the utmost importance to them. \n\nThe narcissist, depending on the supply, may need that window open should they want to return. This is especially for those who have already been with the narcissist in the past and been discarded in the past. It is important for the sake of the cycle that you believe in the discard. Your pain, your hurt, this is negative supply. Your reaction fuels the narcissist. Your tears are like Gatorade for the narcissist who is going through hell and high water to hurt you. \n\nIt’s a delicate balance because the narcissist has to hurt you in vacuum like conditions. The narcissist isn’t going to berate you and show the world the psychotic demon within, no. The narcissist has many faces (s)he needs to protect and everyone can’t see how cruel and hurtful (s)he truly is. The narcissist has carefully curated each of their circles, home, work, school, clubs, and friends. Only you and the narcissist’s other victims will see the final form of contempt and emotional violence. \n\nNow that the narcissist has you believing that it’s all your fault, that you are less than, and have blamed it all on you, now it’s time to rub salt in the wound. The more drama, the better. The more they can twist the knife, the better. If they know just up and leaving you will cause maximum injury, you may just get that. As long as they believe you’re hurting. \n\nWhen they begin to re-idealize you, their confabulation will literally replace their memory of what they have done. As their new supply begins to call them out for their BS like you did, begins to anger at their deplorable actions the way you have done, boom. All of a sudden you aren’t so bad anymore. \n\nThe way they leave keeps your mind spinning. It keeps you stuck in the fog. It keeps you ready to accept any level of misdeed just to have the narcissist back in your life. So when they call you out of the blue 3 years later, you’ve done no healing. You don’t care if the narcissist is monkey branching and you’re ready to accept even bigger lies than the last time you took them back in your life. They look you in your eyes and explain that they didn’t mean what they said during the discard. They really mean it, because they’ve forgotten it. \n\nThey’re hoping you’ve forgotten who they really are, too. ",

        "Upvotes": 4,
        "Text": "Hello, sorry if I'm posting in the wrong thread but I don't have anywhere else to go. I don't know if I'm reading the situation wrong/if I'm the crazy exaggerator so here I wanted an outside opinion. \n\nFor context, me and my sister were raised by my single mom, who is also an immigrant. My sister has classified my mom as a narcissist and an abuser, and I would definitely agree that she has narcissistic tendencies, they're pretty much in line with the \"immigrant parent\" experience and although the abuse has lessened with age. \n\nMy sister was pretty much the scapegoat and I was the golden child 80% of the time; the only time I was \"the problem\" was when social issues were involved as I was very much autistic+ADD and had no idea how to relate to others, so I was bullied and blamed for it. My sister has ADHD and was terrible at school, which is where a lot of my mom's anger towards her came from. She's very bitter about the majority of our childhood, which I understand; there are things that happened that I will also simply never recover from, even with therapy. \n\nMy sister is bubbly, charismatic, and very empathetic. I can't stress that enough; everyone loves her. She's friends with random people in our neighborhood, she talks to and befriends homeless people, and is training to be a social worker. She has many close friends and talks to them all day and night. Our relationship was pretty rocky when we were kids, and I can't say that we're as close as some siblings are, but I always thought our relationship was okay. My mom would sometimes complain that we were against her, but I think she was just frustrated that we wouldn't turn on each other easily. However, I did start to notice a few things about my sisters behavior that is concerning me.\n\n- She has a victim complex/hard time doing anything important by herself, but only when I'm available to help/do it for her.\n\nI think this is a consequence of her never being trusted to do things as a child, but I thought she would attempt to get better with age. Nope. She would ask me to fill out her student loan and passport forms, saying that she was scared to get things wrong. When I would try to get her to do it herself, she would get upset with me and call me selfish. She says that this is because she feels that she is not smart enough to do anything bc of her childhood; fair, but she's 22 now, so I think she should try to help herself out and try to build confidence. She now pays her friends to fill out forms for her; one of them is actually being paid to apply for graduate programs for her. Any mention of this makes her talk about how badly she was treated as a kid and how its lead to her being so scared of doing anything, so OF COURSE she needs help 24/7.\n\nBut at the same time, she goes out of her way to help other people with their paperwork; she even helped a coworker get into grant/loan program for university, and that paperwork was 10 times harder than what she has to fill out. It's very confusing, it makes me feel like she does these things so people like her.\n\n- She hates responsibility.\n\n I feel like this is her being self aware that she's sort of useless. For example; she doesn't have a credit card, and just uses my moms/mine and pays us back at the end of the month. Recently, I asked her to stop using my credit card since she kept forgetting to pay me the right amount. She also had this habit of using my card as a form of revenge against me if I forgot to pick up her things during my grocery run (she can't drive). She would also threaten to use my card if I didn't do things for her (she said it was a joke, but it rubbed me the wrong way). Anyway, she got upset and said she needed my card for emergencies. I asked why she didn't just apply for a credit card. She said she was unsure if she would be responsible enough to manage a credit cards and make payments on time. But...she felt comfortable using MY card? The one that I have to manage and make sure payments are made on time? I explained how worrisome that was and she just told me I was crazy and controlling. \n\nThis has also steeped into how she approaches things like deadlines. She missed a deadline for a grant she really needed (twice) and spent an entire week emailing the grant team asking them to accept her application, and then emailing their bosses when they refused. Whenever she's rejected from graduate programs she's always confused and says she should've gotten in, even though there are some clear deficits in her applications.\n\n- She is always telling me how bad of a person I am when I don't do as she says. Like, morally. \n\nA good example I can think of is that she asked me to chip in $23 for her friends birthday; I was confused why I had to pay since the girl wasn't MY friend. My sister argued that since I had talked to her and liked her, this made us friends, and friends contribute to birthdays. She also said if I backed out then she would have to split my part over other people who I would consider to be my friends and that those friends were in tight financial situations, so I would be a shitty person for making them pay extra. I still refused to pay; this really had nothing to do with me. She just looked at me and said that she was surprised that I was such a shitty person.  There are similar stories to this; whenever she wants me to do something and I refuse, she makes me out to be a horrible person. Not in a yelling/screaming way; she just comments \"oh, never knew you were that shitty\" and keeps it up for however long it is until I do the thing she asked for. for some reason I never really saw them as weird until I brought it up with some friends and they said that was messed up.\n\n- She makes fun of/belittles me in front of her friends constantly, but gets upset when I do it back.\n\n^pretty self explanatory. a lot of my sisters friends really like me; I think they see me as a big sister, and a lot of them are in similar situations/career paths as me. They're all very nice. My sister and I are very snarky towards each other, but she is especially mean to me in front of her friends. I'm not 100% sure what she says either; she tries her best to make sure I'm not around much when she's talking to her friends, going out of her way to make sure to exclude me from any plans she makes even when her friends want me to come. She also enjoys rubbing the fact she has friends/plans that I can't join in my face. I'm usually quite busy so it doesn't bother me much, but I have noticed it. she also tends to try and be mean to me in front of them as a joke, but if I snap back I can tell that she gets upset about it. She's asked me to not call her things like stupid in front of her friends (fair, she can be super sensitive about that), but has told many of them about my ASD without my permission (she only asked when they let it slip that they knew). So that's weird. \n\n- she is always switching up the narrative.\n\nthis is the thing that makes me feel INSANE. she is always telling me how horrible she has it at home and how much our mom hates her, and how I will never understand how it feels to be her so it's unfair when I call her out on things like not doing chores (like she does to me) because she will always be scolded more harshly than I will be. that's fine, a little grace is fine, but then she'll just outright lie about how \"great\" she is. For example, in the summer my mother was gone, so we split the chores in the house. I work a lot on weekdays, so she was to take care of general upkeep, and I would do the heavy chores (taking laundry to the laundromat, cooking in bulk for the week, mopping and vacuuming the apartment) on the weekend. I noticed that she would often not be the best at this, but as long as I could fix it on the weekend it was fine. But if I ever messed up, she would be merciless; she refused to wash the dishes for a whole week because I couldn't do them on Sunday since I had extra errands to run that weekend. I brought this up to her and she said we split the chores and that was that. I pointed out that she wasn't keeping her end of the bargain either, but she told me she was simply too busy to keep up with all the work she was being given and that the chore split was unfair anyway. I didn't really know how to deal with that so I dropped it.\n\n\n- She sets boundaries, but I can't.\n\nThere are more issues but I will leave it at this one for last. She has always been very vocal about setting boundaries with me and my mom. For example, we can't give her chores last minute or it messes up her schedule (even if she's doing nothing). She's also really big on talking issues out, but usually the talk just keeps going until we agree with whatever she's saying. Personally, I am the type of person who gets really short and petty when I'm angry, so its not a good idea to talk to me. She will INSIST on talking to me even when I want to shut the conversation down and say my refusal to talk is just proof that she's right and I'm wrong. But if I talk, the conversation will just repeat itself until she gets the answer she wants out of me. She's very good with therapy-speech as well; to be honest, she always sounds condescending when she argues with me or my mom even though she says I'm just projecting. I could be, but I don't hear it when she's arguing with her friends or in online classes.\n\n\nI'm probably being very one sided here, but whenever I think about some of these issues it just reminds me of my mom in a way. I've survived my mom by just nodding along and waiting for the storm to blow over, but my sisters actions are much more annoying to me for some reason. If anyone has any input it would be appreciated. I don't want to think I'm living with 2 narcissists; maybe I'm actually the problem. because of my ASD I find it very hard to communicate my feelings and I tend to shut up or become very mean and short at random times. I try my best but I do need to work on using my words and making sure they can't be used against me.",

        "Text": "First: posting from my backup acct that I use to make extra-vulnerable comments/posts such as this one, so please rest assured that this is not the only thing I think or post about.  \n\nSecond: the following is not an attempt to diagnose or villainize - just pattern recognition, the (relatively recent) hunches that have accompanied it since dating a covert narcissist, and a lil curiosity as to whether I’m the only one with this take after Reddit searches keep coming up empty. \n\nThird: [here’s](https://www.regain.us/advice/general/how-to-identify-covert-narcissism-in-relationships/) what I mean by “covert narcissist” throughout - not the most rigorous site, but info about this is kind of all over the place/hit or miss, and this seems to hit a lot of important points imo.\n\nOk so: I’m wrapping up “Baby Reindeer” and canNOT shake the observation that the director/main character has a lot of traits that point to covert narcissism, and make me very wary of accepting his framing of the story wholesale. While I 100% believe that he was abused, struggled with his sexual identity and mental health, and so on - his self-loathing, constant self-flagellation, centering of his own experience and trauma (doesn’t seem to give two shits about the sustained trauma Teri alludes to), sexual objectification and use of others (even if as a means of processing his own trauma), easy/self-justified lying, and suffocating need for validation and admiration (among other things) are such a specific combo of red flags that are *so* hard to unsee once you’ve encountered them, even when you’re just trying to chill tf out and watch some Netflix. With that (maybe off-base) framing, it’s especially unsettling to see how he’s created this whole vulnerable series about his perspective and trauma (and the oodles of money and praise he’s getting for all that vulnerability) all while he hangs out an also-vulnerable and clearly unwell woman to dry re: the public. \n\nMaybe this is pure projection of my own experience, but it also mirrors that of so many others: my covert narc ex was depressed/self-isolated, felt stuck in life, was hypersexual/a self-described slut but also dealt with ED (also told me he’d been SAed in his twenties, which I believed and still believe - cycles of abuse be complicated), kept mentioning how he suspected people had “crushes” on him, constantly talked about a “stalker” he had in the past (who ended up being a secret girlfriend he had been hiding from his then-partner), low-key hid his bisexuality (did/do not care, am also bi), had that weird combo of self-loathing + “I’m a very special boy who’s just misunderstood” syndrome…\n\nAnyway! Again, not trying to diagnose or villainize or victim-blame - the above is 100% based on my own experience + overlap with a bunch of other personal stories I’ve heard, and was just wondering if anyone else had those alarm bells go off. Dealing with the fallout of having been with a covert narcissist has been incredibly isolating, mostly because 1. he was very discreet, self-deprecating, and quietly charming, and 2. the actual abuse was a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of situation that would take too long to contextualize to someone trying to understand. Those who *have* been with a covert narcissist (and gone down all the info rabbitholes in the aftermath) come to recognize patterns of behavior that we never would have *dreamed* of before coming into contact with them. Like, had I seen this show a year ago, I would have had endless, unconditional empathy for the main character! Hate that that part of me has withered a bit.\n\nNot sure how to wrap this up other than to ask “is it just me??”\n\nEdit: dang, thanks so much for all these thoughtful responses! A lot to think about. ",

How do I become strong enough to just simply walk away?\n\nMy I guess now ex went away and didn’t tell me where, who with and didn’t share any flight details. This was an annoyance and I feel a game because he said I did all those things to him when I was on a work trip - that’s not true btw, I shared every detail imaginable. \n\nAnyway now he’s back and before he came back I sent a note saying I wanted the thousands he owed me, he then proceeded to say that I disgust him because all I care about is money. This guy has borrowed so much from me promising to pay me back just never has. \n\nAnyway, I rang him and without saying anything he told me to go burn in hell because I’ve ignored HIM this entire time of him being away, that’s again not true it’s the other way around. \n\nI said his mom would be ashamed of him and how he’s turned out so he then said my dads a cabbage (he was in a coma and suffered a severe car crash but is now on the mend) and as am I as I’ve had multiple heart surgeries. \n\nI’m doing better but he has no idea about that, he didn’t care to ask. Instead he told me to “just turn over and die” \n\nI feel sick. How can someone who claims to love you be THIS CRUEL??\n\nI hate hate hate that he’ll have a new supply in days if he doesn’t have one already. ",

Sell those dreams. Fake that future. \n\nHave you ever stopped to think about what it’s like to tell every romantic partner you have these things? \n\nA narcissist knows they are manipulating you. \n\nEven if they don’t, they know they’ve got a history of having intense feels that evaporate quickly. \n\nThat’s why a narcissist insists on moving quickly. \n\nThey make big asks like “move in with me,” “marry me,” “move far away with me,” “let’s have a baby.”\n\nThose of us who are broken, looking for a sense of belonging, caring for others instead of ourselves: it’s all we’ve ever wanted. It’s everything we want to hear.\n\nWe don’t stop to think that maybe this is a script. Maybe I’m the 6th “love of their life.”\n\nAfter the hoover comes re-idealization. \n\n“I’ve never been so sorry.” \n\n“Don’t leave me, you’re the only person that understands me.” \n\n“I’ll do better this time.”\n\nTo avoid manipulation, you need to ask yourself and this person questions. What is your idea of love? Why are you in a rush? If you’re sorry you left me, can you walk me through what you did wrong? What evidence do you have of your growth? \n\nRefuse gifts. Refuse trips. Refuse quick transactions. \n\n“No thank you, I don’t need a Gucci bracelet.”\n\nThink back to how different things would have gone if you said no during lovebombing. \n\nSaying “no” is good for real love, and bad for manipulation.

        "Text": "Hey all, \n\nSo earlier there was a post about the social media patterns of narcs. And it just so happened to coincide with a thought and question I now have.\n\nI suspect my friend's boyfriend is a narc. He does things that throw up a lot of red flags. Anyway, he created a Facebook page with a fake name just before the relationship started and she was his only friend. Three months into their relationship, he adds a new, younger girl. This, after he made a big stink about not having friends of the opposite sex in a \"real\" relationship. I figured this was possibly his new supply. But now my friend has added this new girl four months later. He's had control of her phone quite a bit, so I thought maybe he added her himself for some reason.\n\nMaybe I'm reading too much into this. But would a narc really introduce their new supply to the current one? Has anyone ever seen this or been involved in a situation like this? I know narcissists are cruel, but this sounds downright sadistic. But again, maybe it's just me. Any thoughts/input are, as always, appreciated.",

I have come to the conclusion that maybe we put too much thought to the mysticism instead of being rooted in reality since in reality it doesn’t make sense that a person would stay with someone who is literally hurting them… its like I in a way do blame me staying longer than usual on my fantasy beliefs such as twin flame and happily ever after. It has been sometime now and I can say I am in a much better place mentally and emotionally even spirtually. Did any of you experience my situation and you also like me feel that it may have had contributed to you overstaying with the narcissit? ",

I caught her cheating and she was devaluing me constantly and disrespecting me and it went to such an extent that even though I loved her so much I told her on her face that she will never be happy and the one whom she is with will die or leave her soon and she will be miserable again. \n\nAfter that I blocked her and she blocked me everywhere. It was a really hard time I cried my eyes out and I begged in front of God to take away the pain but it took me 4 months atleast to get out of it and it was all because of my friends and parents. Slowly I started forgetting about her. There were some bad days and there were some truly amazing days when she wasn't even once on my mind but they were quite rare. Still I do think about her sometimes but there's no pain.\n\nNow even when I visit the places that I avoided as it pulled me in her thoughts because of the time spent with her on those places it doesn't trigger me. I was really unsure about reaching to this point as I have had breakups before and I know that how troublesome narcissistic abuse is as compared to breakup.  \n\nI just want to tell all of you to soon get out of relationship with a narcissist if you are with one as it will give you nothing but pain only. And if you leave them then also you will be in pain but soon you will see the things that you can't see now and one day you will be happy that you got out of it. Life is really beautiful without the vampires whom we know as narcissists. \n\nHate them or love them but don't be with them as if will be miserable for you but when you leave them there's no doubt only the miserable one's will be the narcissists not you.

        "Text": "I'm gonna keep this post really short so I don't have to relive most things that happened, but.. I met him when I was 17 and he was 25. I was with him on and off for almost two to three years. I went through a lot with him. He used to feed me alcohol until I wanted to puke to either get sex out of me or ask me if \"we\" could get another girlfriend. He used to give me money and then throw it back at me to hold it over my head. He used to get jealous when I mentioned any other male, but if he mentioned a female, it was a fair game. Because I am pansexual, he thought it would be okay to ask me to bring us home another girl for him to fuck, even if I was monogamous. This and a plethora of other things happened and it completely traumatized me with relationships. His mom tried to warn me..\n\nAt the end of our relationship, in front of my 16 year old sister, he put his hands on me, sat on my chest, and tried to choke me out of this life.. I didn't fight back, I was in disbelief. My middle sister called my mom, and my mom and youngest sister (10 at the time)  showed up only for him to put his hands on them too when they tried to intervene. He pulled a sword on us and tried slicing at us. He was off an eight ball of cocaine, puking drunk, while also high as hell from weed. It was the worst night of my life. My mom called the cops and I left after that and never went back. \n\nIt's been two years since this, and pressing charges have been slow. He's gotten into more trouble since then: he's put hands on the other women he cheated on me with through the entirety of our years together. He ran from the cops after being caught DWI- TWICE. He's in jail right now for a bail of about $5,000. I'm thinking about dropping my charges against him so I don't have to deal with seeing his lying, manipulative face ever again. But the other females he's assaulted don't want me to drop the charges. I don't really want to, but I don't know if I can ever see him again and be okay. I don't want to see him. Or hear the voice that used to tell me he loved me and call me \"darlin.\" I loved him so much and stayed through it all because I thought I needed him to survive. What do I do? \n\nEdit: I guess I should mention that I am a black female and he is a white male. The justice system most likely won't side with the right person in my case. ",

        "Text": "I am 20F college going. Last year at my Uni I met a girl who introduced me to a guy. We three became really close. The guy was very flirty but I played it off. She kept insisting that he was a great guy and that he's \"different\" with me and we look good together. I started liking him but was scared of dating. He told me it's great to date but I denied. He said he respects women and was sweet at first. \nAfter a while though, he started repetitively coercing for sexual favours which I denied and asked him to stop. I told him I was very uncomfortable (and had a fight later) and he did stop for a while and I thought he was a nice person after all. Big mistake. He ruined the finals of a subject when I scored better, constant gaslighting, stonewalling, abusive, bringing down my self esteem, isolating me from others, tried to shatter my confidence to the core and brought my anxiety up. \nOnce when we were travelling in a group he got me alone and tried to forcibly kiss me. He touched my breast and made it seem \"accidental\". And he began coercing again.\n\nAnd the worst part? He knew I had severe sexual trauma. He pretended to be supportive at the time.\nWhenever I tried to leave him, the girl threatened saying she would stop talking to me and to everyone ( was suicidal) and I felt responsible. She insisted he was just playing around and was a good guy. \nMy mind was fucked up. On one side, he was making me feel inadequate to leave. I was trauma bonding and my anxiety was high up. He told me that I couldn't cross him, I couldn't tell people. He said he would make my life miserable and he may not do it quick but he won't let it go. I was scared tbh even though we were \"friends\". I wanted to leave but didn't know how. He knew that I liked him. I didn't like that I liked him. He again started asking for sexual favours and was always staring at my body. Then he tried to get me to ask him out, practically forced. Eventually, I was about to. But thankfully I took the other route as I realised the issues. I stopped talking to him as much to slowly cut off (same friend group).\n\nThen began another episode. He tried to isolate me, staring, spread rumours, create divide, brought down my mental health so much. I tried to talk to him to stop everything but it was the most fucked up conversation. He laughed and said \"I know\" when I told him anybody in my position would have hit him. I completely cut him off but the issues escalated. Tried to help her get away from him till I got to know she was helping him in many ways. Then cut them both off. Everyone in my friend group got to know and they too took my side.\nHe didn't truly back off. The narcissistic abuse plus the sexual abuse and targeting my existing trauma, it all got too much.\nI was genuinely tired. I got sick often, really sick. My mind was racing. I became overly sensitive, fearful. It was terrible. The time with him was the hell he promised if I crossed him. I didn't have to \"cross him\" to know hell. The fact that he would do it to other people possibly without consequences really broke the ceiling. I didn't care. I got over the fear and reported him. \n\nThe Uni authorities were the least supportive but they were scared I would go to the police (I made it very clear that if they suppress it, it'll get worse) and so they wanted to take some action. By this time a lot of students got to know a rumour which wasn't in favour of me so my friends cleared my name and told them the actual story. A lot of them turned against him and some didn't want to openly support to protect their own image. It became terrible for him to stay. So from the university and his side, they both wanted out and transferred him to another campus. \n(I have to mention that two faculties were there for me throughout the entire thing.)\n\nI feel like he's not done though. My friends thought I might just be paranoid. I didn't think so but I didn't want to waste more time on him and I concentrated on myself and studies. But yesterday I found out he was stalking my socials. In group chats. I don't know if he is doing anything more. I don't know what to do about that. Can't he just grow up for once. \n\nP.S. he did something terrible (possible SA) to a girl (another city, past) and when she tried to take action, he ruined her education. Another girl was threatened to leave. His parent is highly influential espc in that city. I got to know this recently. \n\nI guess I'm just venting because I think he's gonna come back at some point. Perfect candidate for dark triad. I don't regret reporting him or any of the consequences he faced. I didn't do it to hurt him but rather to protect myself and because I have a lot of empathy for people he will affect. I always avoided hurting him unnecessarily. There were times when I was so angry that if I said something it would break his fragile self image and cause further injury. I knew enough to make it hurt. But I didn't want to. It wasn't about winning but he won't understand any of this... And idk... \n\nWhat do you all think? Am I just overthinking this? ",

I've got many MANY stories of situations with her. She likes to shock people so in high school she \"got pregnant\" from one time but now that she's married she \"keeps miscarrying\". It's odd and ironic. And people keep giving her money and gifts. Her then best friend even had a GoFundMe going for her for IVF but then suddenly the GFM disappeared and they were no longer friends. But that's not the only time she's received money for her miscarriages. \n\nShe also likes to \"Coincidentally\" copy and claim other people's struggles as her own. But she's so good at these stories that everyone believes her! It's so annoying! I had lost a baby in my 2nd trimester and ended up hospitalized and sure enough, she posts a story a few months later nearly identical to mine. Many things in her story don't add up. I just need to see I'm not the icky one that sees through her and how awful it is to use this terrible experience to gloat and get attention. I've copied her story from Facebook which will make this post a novel, but it's worth it, I promise. \n\nAlso note, she can't keep a job, her husband doesn't work and they have no insurance and live rent free under the roof of her husband's parents second house. His family has a little money but not a ton. How is she even affording any of this? \n\nHere it is:\n\n“This is going to be a multiple parts post. As this story is long and word limit sucks. \n\nThis past year with IVF and life in general has been one of the most stressful trying times in my life. \n\nBack in 2019 my husband and I suffered our 6th miscarriage. The miscarriage happened in such a way that even though the fetus stopped growing at 6 weeks 3 days, my body still thought that I was pregnant. \n\nWe found out in January shortly after my Grandfather Gary lost his 20+ year long battle to cancer. We had so many miscarriages by this point that I was scared to be happy. So I made an appointment with an OBGYN. At our first ultrasound the tech said she found the gestational sac but no fetus. The doctor then came in and told me to get ready to miscarry. \n\nI then went up to UofU for a 2nd ultrasound. There they had better tech and they might be able to tell me what's wrong. They found a small fetus inside the gestational sac that measured 5 weeks. So we just thought that I got my dates off by a week. We went home with happy hearts. \n\nA week later I returned to UofU for a 3rd ultrasound. They couldn't detect a heartbeat. They told me to get ready to miscarry. I was devastated just last week I went through this. And I thought we had overcome it. We went home with heavy hearts.\n\nA week passed and there were no signs of me starting to miscarry the pregnancy so I returned to UofU they did a 4th ultrasound and nothing had changed. The baby measured at 6 weeks but no heartbeat detected. They told me to return 3 days later for a D&C.\n\n3 days later I went back up to UofU for a 4th time this time to have my baby removed from my uterus. But as they were putting me under for the procedure I heard \"WAIT THERE IS A HEARTBEAT!\" \n\nI came a little while later and the doctor told me that she found a heartbeat and didn't do the procedure. She said the baby's heart rate was 101 which was slower than normal but still there. She sent me home with instructions to rest. \n\nCont. In post part 2 miscarriage\n\nPart 2 cont.\n\nAfter sending me home with instructions to rest I returned a week later and a different Dr did my ultrasound. He told me that the heart rate had dropped to 60 beats per minute.  He told me that the pregnancy was dying and that I should just do the D&C now. But in my heart the baby was alive as it had a heartbeat so I would wait until we were sure that the baby was dead in all aspects.\n\nIt took 2 weeks for the heart to finally stop. When I should have been around 13 weeks on April 5th I went in and had the D&C done. They did not put me under this time. They just lightly sedated me. Worst. Experience. Of. My. Life. I remember every agonizing moment. Every cramp. Every pull. I blacked out a few times from the amount of pain I was in.\n\nThey sent the fetus to be tested with the hope we could find out why I had 6 miscarriages with 0 living children over my 7 years of marriage. I can say we were finally able to find answers. Just in the worst way possible. I suffer from a condition where my body contributes to many chromosomes to the fetus. This is called trisomy. Sometimes babies can live with this. Like trisomy 21 is downs syndrome. But my body did 16 which is not viable with life. \n\nAfter the consultation with my OB and the genetasist we came to the conclusion that IVF with embryo testing called PTG-A would be our best best to be able to have a healthy pregnancy with hopefully minimal hardships. \n\nI was worried about the financial and physical consequences of IVF but I came to find out that my Grandfather (who helped raise me from age 7 to 14)  left me an inheritance that was just enough to cover the cost. \n\nSummer 2022 came and the last of my inheritance from the sale of my grandparents house allowed me to pay for the IVF and we started the process. \n\nCont. In post 3\n\nPart 3 comes with a TW\n\nThe summer of 2022 we started the IVF process\n\nTo start with we had to get my body ready for the egg retrieval. To do this I had to do 6 weeks of twice daily injection in my lower stomach along with taking oral hormones. \n\nThe day of egg retrieval itself was relatively easy as they put me under general anesthesia. So I was OUT. they were able to retrieve 11 eggs. The aftermath of the retrieval? BRUTAL I felt like I was in labor or something similar for the next 3 days. I couldn't walk around without doubling over and having to lamaz breath to get through the pain and cramps. It was awful and I pray that I never have to do the egg retrieval process again as I do not want to go through that again. The thought makes me wanna cry. \n\nThe day of the egg retrieval they did assisted fetus hatching. This gave us 9 fertilized embryos from the 11 eggs retrieved. They then scraped the outer part of the embryos then flash froze them and sent the scrapings off to be genetically tested. \n\nTangent: during this time other things in my personal life imploded and I'm still having to clean up that mess. And the stress from the implosion probably contributed to what happened next...\n\nAt the beginning of December we got the results back. Out of the 9 embryos 2 were genetically viable both were little girl embryos. Shortly after Christmas I started a new set of injection hormones. This time to get ready to transfer one of the embryos in January. The transfer itself was the easiest part of this whole process!! I went in laid down they inserted a clear catheter got the embro out thawed it and plopped it into my uterus and then began the 2 week wait. Which sucked as I was on bedrest and the cabin fever was REAL.\n\nThe transfer was successful as 2 weeks later I got that much hoped for double pink line and my HCG levels were perfect 💜 \nThe ultrasound pictured was taken when I was around 5 weeks gestation and I couldn't have been happier!\n\nBut it wasn't to last.... Cont. In post 4\n\nPart 4 \n\nAfter confirming my pregnancy we couldn't have been more excited to meet our little girl. We started thinking about names and talking about future plans. \n\nI went in for my 7 weeks ultrasound and the universe in its ever sarcastic sardonic dumb dumbness hit the \"repeat 2019 miscarriage\"button. There was a gestational sac but no fetus. Get ready to miscarry. \n\nA week passed and no signs of miscarriage (see where this is going yet?) Then one night around 9 pm I started hemorrhaging but thank goodness I had a best friend who wasn't squeamish because she drove me to the ER at midnight and proceeded to help me though one of the most traumatic experiences I've been thru bearable. She made sure to make me laugh and was a true friend. \n\nA few days after the ER visit I went back to UofU and met with my Dr where I found out that there was still pregnancy tissue. So she had me take a pill to re-induce the miscarriage to get everything out. With my luck. It. Didn't. Work. So my last option? Another D&C. Yay. Me. \n\nI told the Dr that this time I needed to go into the OR and be put under. She was understanding and that is what we did. So here I am 1 year into the process and preparing to start the transfer process for a second time. This time? I'm bringing y'all with me.”\n\nI just needed to vent. And the story doesn't add up. Please let me know what you think. Thank you! ",

        "Text": "So here's the story.\n\nI started seeing a therapist six months ago, because I had boundary issues with my diagnosed BPD mother. So far, therapy worked pretty well.\n\nHowever, I have recently been discarded by my husband of nine years who started an emotional affair around 3 months ago with his new supply and tried to put all the blame on me for his behavior.\n\nSince he had me convinced for most of our relationship that I was the entire problem, the realization of what he actually was only developed slowly, after the discard. Only now do I see more clearly the manipulation, the plausible denial, the gaslighting, the disrespect, etc.\n\nWhen I started talking about this to my therapist, at first they plainly said that they could not diagnose my husband a narcissist, because it would not be a professional thing to do. I fully understand, however, at the end of the session, they still said that they thought I was right about the narcissism.\n\nStill, because I was at the very beginning of the process of realizing the truth about what had happened to me for the past decade of my life, I said to the therapist that I would only go back to my husband if he started seeing a therapist (now I did an 180 turn around to LC). And my psychologist then replied: \"Yes, of course. In any relationship now, you will need to start on a blank slate regarding your boundaries, standards, what you are ready to accept from the other person, etc. Be it with your husband or a new person.\"\n\nBut after spending some time on this sub and going through a very cruel discard (that my therapist knows about), it seems that she should just have told me to go NC, run, and hide from my husband right away.\n\nSo, to cut the story short, I was happy with my therapist until my real problems surfaced and now I am wondering if I should change for a psychologist who knows a little bit better about NPD. My main problem is that, in my country, therapists only seem to deal with \"narcissistic perverts\", whereas my husband is definitely a covert narcissist.\n\nAny advice appreciated.",

We started talking and we never stopped talking…until she discarded me.\n\nAfter that happened the rumination began. It consumed me. I couldn’t get her off my mind. It took about 3 months before I stopped crying. Now at about five months out I can finally breathe again, laugh again, and actually have fun without her memories haunting me. \n\nIn my opinion, obsession is in the tool kit of rumination overall. You love the idealized version of them in your head as well. It’s called a “shared fantasy” because you’re there as well. \n\nObsessions are your minds attempt at controlling a situation that your body has not. Your mind wants to propel your body to get back on course, to get back on track.\n\nIn addition to using my method of answering my own questions I’ll never get answers to from my ex pwNPD, I remind myself that I’m not in control and that’s okay.\n\nI also struggle with hoarding and OCD, so it’s extra tough for me. \n\nI write about what I want to control over, remind myself that I’m powerless over that, and I will spend 10 minutes in silence meditating on it. Silently reminding myself. For example:\n\n*I want to see the moment when everyone finds out she is a fraud and a narcissist.*\n\nIt doesn’t matter if they find out. She doesn’t belong to you anymore, and she never really did. Her family is trapped in the fog just like you were, and you have to let all of them go. \n\n*I want to play out my revenge fantasies on her. I want to lodge 3 wine keys in her tires because with 3 your insurance won’t pay out*\n\n\nAll that would do is reinforce her narrative, give her a bonding event with her new supply, and make you look crazy. Channeling this energy and putting it elsewhere is best. The numbers say she is hurting financially. Hurting her is not who I am, I want her to be well so she can stay away. \n\nIt is perfectly normal to be upset, angry, petty, all of that. \n\nWhen you get there, guide yourself back to reality. You’re not in control of that situation. Let go. Once you tell yourself enough that you are not in control, it will help you to diminish your obsession. \n",

And I get  mad, like he says it’s an apology and that he has not even mentioned my name publicly as to not blame me but then included my photos ironically. \n\n2nd nightmare was worse, he checks my social media to find I’ve accepted requests of people he forced me to block. He storms my messages with different numbers and each time I block him. Some messages are sweet like “please talk to me my love”. And others are bad, like “this is what you do once we breakup”. This is also based on similar incidents happened in past. Then he comes to my place and I was expecting it so I hide. My friends tell him I’m not here. He goes looking for me.

He kept trying to be better and show me he changed and only wanted me but obv I was hesitate and hurt. I denied being with someone for a while and then finally told him months later. So yes, I lied about that and was wrong. Iv also lied about minor little stupid things mostly due to fear of how he’d respond which always backfired on me anyways. I lost either way. So, after a while and trying to move forward ..things died down & he would begin to again  give me the silent treatment, ignore me , be mean, start telling me when I would cry they are fake tears and I’ll be fine, I’ll be with someone else next week, being mean you know bc I was with someone after when we weren’t together yet he dated someone for months while dating me to. \n\n\nSo, my reactive abuse I started to vent to people and I wasn’t trying to air out my dirty laundry but, just wnated to be heard. I asked his friend to please tell him to call me back, please tell him to stop ignoring me. I shouldn’t have to right, and he would get more more at me bc I reached out to his friend. I talked to his friend gf bc she’s been around and I was cool with her and it got back to him so that backfired in my face. I asked random girls I was in a group chat with if they knew him , that got back to him. So overall I look crazy, corny and immature as he said. And.. I do. But I’m sad bc that’s not who I am and I wish I never responded in certain ways . Now “ he doesn’t want to associate with someone like me “ . \n\nI’m hurt because, my reactive responses are being held against me and he’s saying he doesn’t trust me and I withhold the truth a lot and he has to always press me about things to get answers. N sometimes those have been true but he never talks about how him ignoring me when Iv asked so much please stop doing that affects me.

He let me go through his phone, and I saw everything. It was disgusting, so I left. \n\nNow, the entire relationship was the equivalent of him sticking me in a jar with no way out, shaking the jar violently and then acting like I was the aggressor when I expressed my anger at being shaken. Since the breakup, he has sent me an email approximately every three weeks or so, telling me that he’s already started telling people in our hometown, where he lives but I no longer do, that I am an abuser, and that he’ll make sure that every single person he encounters knows “the truth” about me. I have a suspicion that he’s doing this because he wants to discredit me in case I decided to tell anyone about what I found on his phone. So that anyone I could possibly tell would come from a starting point of thinking I’m crazy and abusive. \n\nAnd, of course, you may be wondering why it matters what people from my hometown think about me if I’m no longer living there. I want to settle down there permanently once I graduate with my PhD in 3 years. Living there but commuting to a job in a different town isn’t really an option, as I want to teach at a community college, and the nearest one that isn’t in my town is an hour and a half away. \n\nSo, my question is: has anyone ever had the smear campaign go so far as to harm your job prospects? Anyone from a tiny town where word travels fast and your narcissist has a powerful and influential social sphere that they like to leverage? What did you do? What should I do?

I hated this feeling of being used, but I stuck around hoping he cared for me on some level - after all, he’d constantly talk to me daily for hours then would suddenly stop talking to me saying that he was busy with life stuff and then would hit me up out of the blue weeks later, as if nothing happened. Every message feels like dopamine… I was always there whenever he felt bored or had lost a loved one. He admitted to one of his ex-best friends that he was messing with me on purpose two months ago because he thinks that I’m “toxic” and that he was “saving everyone from me” and I haven’t recovered since. He claims that he thinks that he had a perfect childhood and has either BPD or bipolar (undiagnosed) but I 100% believe that he is a narc. All my friends have always despised this guy because of the way that he’s treated me, they’re mad about how many chances that I’ve given him but I can’t even say anything about it since we’ve never officially dated. It was just a “situationship”.\n\nI drew so much art for him that he still uses as an icon and I wish that I had never made it for him. It hurts. I’m glad he’s spending more time away from me than usual since it’s helping me feel less addicted to him, but I still struggle with having to eventually to cut him off. It really sucks loving people that only see you as nothing a toy…",

I have healed a lot and the occasional triggers are the only thing that harasses me but slowly and gradually I have started losing thier frequency as well.\n\nThe only thing that harasses me is the thought that she didn't hoover. It makes me feel like shit and unworthy. I don't know how to overcome this one issue and will it decrease with time or no. It hurts me sometimes like hell and I ain't able to adjust to it. It took me so much time to heal and they are posting updates with someone else on social media to hurt me more but even this I know is a narcissistic technique to pour more fuel over the fire. This also has no effect on me now but only one thing that they didn't contact me back. I did so much and I didn't even receive the respect worth even 1 percent of it.\n\nDoes anyone else suffer from this and how do you overcome this one issue. ",

I keep blocking and unblocking my ex narc. I’m so sick and twisted. why can’t I move on from him.11 years of mind games I know he doesn’t care I feel all this stuff is all on me now. I know he’s a narcissst I know he isn’t capable of treating me right. I know now what I experienced is/was abuse.  \n\n\nThen on top of all those feelings I lost my biggest support.  It’s like a I repel anything good in my life as soon as I get close to it. My best friend the biggest support in my life is being so distant after she set up a nice birthday for me yesterday. I’ve been apologizing and trying anything to get her to tell me what is wrong bc I drank too much and don’t remember but I know\nAt one point she was upset bc I was showing gratitude to everyone but her but I was over compensating and I didn’t get to her yet. The truth is I love her so much that I maybe I was afraid I’d say too much. She’s the best thing in my life and I’m terrified of losing her and i guess I push people away i am afraid of losing. Idk what happened. I haven’t drank like that in over 10 months and now I remember why . The shame and anxiety and I’ve been thru it before but everytime my best friend reassured me and provided me comfort and now I can’t get any reassurance. It’s not her fault I am too codependent I can’t self soothe. I feel useless and worthless and horrible. \n\nI have so much to do but I can’t motivate myself to do it. I feel so down and suicidal. I feel so hopeless. Without my best friend and support I realize I am nothing. \n\nShe won’t talk to me about it. Idk what to do . I feel so low. Never felt this close to just ending it all. I feel so alone and like such a burden. To everyone. It was a mistake I was even born. \n\nI know they say feelings don’t last but this feeling is heavy in my throat and gut. How do I hold on ",

Everyone does something different. Kind of like a startup.\n\nWhen there was no one to fill up my position, this colleague did it for a couple of weeks.\nSince our boss doesn’t know my work either, he cannot evaluate me, so this colleague has been chosen, as there is no one else who could check my work while I am on probation!... \n\nI have never received any feedback from him directly. He just gives his opinion directly to my boss on Zoom meetings and I know nothing about it until I hear about it from my boss. \n\nI am not in a good situation right now. I might loose my job. I have already asked this colleague to give me some feedback to try and have a conversation with him, but he hasn’t replied to me. I just have told my boss about this today.\n\nMy boss seems to be sorry for me but he is embarrassed. The organization cannot change. There isn’t anyone competent anyway. He doesn’t understand the situation about the fact this colleague is manipulative and toxic. He just doesn’t get it. He is just too nice. He doesn’t see the bad in people. He is blind.\n\nI have taken the opportunity to tell my boss that I had never gotten any feedback from this colleague. He says to me: ‘’ok. We are going to deal with this by training you.’’ So I have one month left to see how they are going to manage this. My colleague probably won’t accept the situation well, as he doesn’t like to be confronted, all he does is to be critical and hasn’t replied to me when I had asked him about his feedback. doesn’t accept my own feedback.\n\nIt would be better if he stopped trusting unlegitimate colleagues. I am just baffled at the absurdity of the situation.\n\nI have been told twice by my boss that I had to improve because this colleague wasn’t happy about my work, and now I have only one month left until I end my probation ends. \n\nI don’t need training from this colleague. I am a certified professional and I do not understand why this narcissistic colleague does this… Why lying about my work? Maybe because he knows I am more competent than him? (I am more experienced. I am older.) We aren’t in the same field of work but somehow he wants power. He wants to keep the first place. He used to be a manager in another company.\n\nMy boss loves kind people so getting angry wouldn’t be efficient. And this colleague is very toxic so any confrontation would make things worse. ",

He will call me names, degrade me and dismiss my feelings. He has little empathy for me when I try to share insecurities, fears or feelings in general. I told him I was worried about pregnancy, given that I recovered from an eating disorder. He said to \"get over it you’re of child bearing age.\" I also injured my knee while training for a marathon. I did a training run before our camping/hiking trip and was upset that it hurt and he said, \"You're so selfish, don't ruin my vacation.\" He will say things like \"you're getting older, no one else will want you\" or \"you're worthless, you do nothing for me\" etc. It turned physical with grabbing, pushing, and holding me against a wall with his hand around my neck. I've since left the relationship and am reflecting on whether or not this man is just abusive or is also narcissistic. He said to me once something to the extent of, \" I just have to get you pregnant and then I'll be done w you.\" I'm thinking maybe this meant he would discard me or use me to fuel his narcissism after I was trapped. We were really close to getting engaged and buying a house. What do others think? Was he trying to trap me? Was this thing said in jest evidence of his intentions? Is this narcissistic behavior or is he just an abusive asshole?",

She was never the problem.\n\n-we try to gaslight and manipulate you whenever you call her out on her wrong doing\n\n-always asking for other peoples validation, severely insecure, claiming she had body dysmorphia\n\n-every time she was around a certain group of people she would come back and tell her friends that people were talking about them. Then when you wanted to confront them, she would say no don’t say anything. They’re not gonna tell me anything else.\n\n-always bringing her friends back mess and rumors only to find out she was the one bringing up your name around certain people, knowing they were going to say something negative about you because she knew they didn’t like you\n\n-always wanting to know every detail of your life as if you were obligated to share with her then we get mad and try to guilt trip you using the we’re best friends line. Literally wanted to know your every move.\n\n-Always had her friends boyfriend or husband’s number and side texting them inappropriately \n\n-Still acting like we’re in high school.

        "Text": "So I don't even know where to start.  I guess this is all a big bad choice on my part because my nex quite clearly informed me that she had relationship and attachment problems.\n\nWe dated for almost a year and sometimes I could see the cracks but they were almost always aimed at other people like her mom so it was easy for me to agree and not get caught in the crossfire.  She told me all these horrible things her exes had done and always made it out to be she is the victim.  I noticed often she would even accuse her friends, exes, and parents of narcissism... and it seemed to be constant, *everybody else* was a narcissist.  She was never really warm with me.  No hugging, no kissing.  Only sex at prescribed times in a very weirdly \"ritualistic\" way.  But she wasn't really too bad to me either.  We did things together and we had fun.\n\nDuring the end of October she had some sort of episode and started accusing me of a bunch of random things constantly like looking at her wrong.  She said I was making her feel ugly with the way I was looking at her, which I told her I don't even know what that means and she said I was gaslighting her and doing it on purpose.  I thought if I ignored it it would just stop... and it did for a few weeks... flash forward to Christmas Eve and she had a meltdown at dinner with her family.    \n  \nHer mom asked her some question about her work and she stared saying her mom was trying to sabotage my relationship with her because I guess she hadn't been working for a bit and didn't want to tell me yet.  When I asked her what it was all about, her first reaction was to accuse me of trying to control her and \"know everything about her all the time\" and invade her privacy... as if I didn't just sit their for a super awkward family fight that didn't need to happen.  The drive home was terrible and she accused me of ruining her Christmas even though I spent so much money, time, and genuine effort trying to give her a good one... 4 hours stuck in that car as she just stayed silent and mad at me after chewing me out and making me feel awful.\n\nChristmas day was when things got batty.  I baked some cookies for us and she seemed to enjoy them... only two hours later the entire plate of cookies was in the bin... the entire plate, still cling wrapped... just didn't want them anymore she said.  Then when I asked why she told me to leave for starting fights.  It was at this point I Knew I was dealin with real touble.  LIterally kicked out on xmas day over nothing.  The next week I didn't go back and she started trying to contact me in a bunch of ways so I kept blockin her\n\nWe broke up on New Years eve because she was sending me text messages from a bunch of phone numbers calling me an abuser and crazy, saying I'm a narcissisit trying to control her life and make her question her reality.  She told me she threw out all the gifts I bought her because they were just \"tools of manipulation.\"  I don't even know what kind of person talks like this and takes themselves seriously...I blocked her because I realized she was just too far gone.  I don't know how somebody could change so dramatically in 2 weeks... I guess me finding out about the job thing exposed a big secret?  It wasn't even my fault I found out.\n\nAnyway, on New Years day (less than 24hrs after breakup) she sends me an e-mail... yeah, a friggin actual e-mail, telling me that she is FOUR MONTHS pregnant with my child and will be pursuing full custody... and to me she didn't look it... plus I just bought pads for her the month before?  But I guess whatever, I consider the potential.  I'm absolutely in a panic now.  We start talking again and immediately she starts making more fights with me when I'm just trying to figure out what the plan is.  She keeps saying she isn't going to give her kid up, so I don't fight her on it.  She keeps calling me names and saying I won't take care of my kid so she'll have to make sure I never see them.\n\nEvery few weeks since then she is sending \"updates\" on the pregnancy and what doctors are apparently saying.  Now one thing making me mad is she kept saying I wouldn't take her to the doctor, but I offered... but she insists I'm too much of an abuser?  So basically every single update she is slipping in insults, all the while I respond as business casual as I can.  It just boggles the mind to say I didn't offer help when I did.  So it's like, really?  You're just making your own problem.  Anyway, I still have gotten these e-mails, even one as recent as last week claiming she spoke to a midwife and that everything was looking great or some completely made up bollocks.\n\nAnyway this week was the revelation.  I saw my nex at the store with her new boyfriend.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity so I asked her, \"how's the pregnancy going, everything good?\"  This made her scramble.  She told her bf right then and there that I'm the stalker ex she was talking about and that I'm just making it up for drama, without even answering me directly... it was instant damage control mode.  This poor dude didn't really have much to say and just seemed stunned.  I just said, \"whatever you say, x\" and walked away.  Keep in mind... if she was really 4 MONTHS in January 1st, she'd be at 8 almost 9 months now.... ready to pop...  She would absolutely be showing.  She's a very slim girl.  Clearly she made a big lie to mess with me for months on end.  In hindsight I should have asked for any proof at all... although I'm sure she'd make that up too.\n\nIt's just crazy that somebody can be so self absorbed and keep trying to make themselves a victim while they do the most awful things.  I can't imagine lacking a soul, but I'm pretty sure that's what the problem with narcs is.  I hope this new guy can deal with it.  Like this whole lie was an anchor to keep me in the fight.\n\nThis has all left me feeling terrible because I thought I was going to have to have my first born child with somebody who is basically inhuman and just wants to cause pain.  I deleted all my socials and I'm considering moving to a new town, because after finding out this big lie, I'm afraid she's going to find a way to come after me again.  These narcs don't seem to know the idea of stopping.",

        "Text": "The narcissist is a transactional being by nature. The process by which the narcissist and other cluster B personalities detach on a dime is called decathexis. Definitely worth a Google. Everyone engages in this behavior in this life, but the difference for a narcissist is that virtually all their romantic partners will experience this, even if they don’t get discarded physically.\n\nThe narcissist is looking for 4s: safety, sex, supply, services. If someone comes into the narcissist’s life offering a superior level of these things the narcissist doesn’t consider how much they love you (ha!), care for you, or how many years you’ve been together. The narcissist will give you no credit for the things you’ve done. The only thing that may stand in their way is the management of their image. They know they are not like the rest of the world. Don’t ever let a narc convince you they don’t know what they’re doing. \n\nTrue to the narc’s transactional nature, they will simply make a business decision. Which option is going to give me the most potent source of supply? They will make a decision. Decathexis will ensue. It won’t be a long drawn out process for them. They don’t need to have discussions, therapy, or closure. They will simply make that choice. In the blink of an eye, with the snap of a finger, with one beat of your heart, they have disconnected themselves COMPLETELY. Just like that. Boom. Over. \n\nOne of the most common questions I see on this subreddit is “how can they do this to me?” You want to know how it’s so easy for them to leave. That’s an indication that you don’t understand the narcissist. \n\nThe narcissist is devoid of love. The narcissist lacks empathy. Some greater narcs have very little to zero empathy. That means they can never fall in love with you. They aren’t pair bonded: there is no attachment to break. They aren’t neurotypical. They aren’t like you. That’s how.\n\nThey are inherent users. They see qualities in you that will supply them. So they use you. They reassess if the supply worth the cost often like a business owner. If you cost too much, they’ll cut the loss. Business must keep flowing, so they will get another supplier lined up before cutting you. \n\nI wish it were more complicated than that, but the narcissist is extremely predictable and very simple.\n\nI read often that the narcissist spent money. Maxed out credit cards. Cleaned out bank accounts. Then left.\n\nHow could they? \n\nTransaction complete. Your supply ran out. What they were using in you ran out.\n\nAnd so did they. \n\nA narcissist in decathexis is very irritable. Even a vulnerable narc will rage and become more overt. There is no type constancy with a narc. This is where you will see a side of the narc you didn’t know was there.\n\nI really need you to remember as the weeks, months, and years go on, and the narcissist is hoping you forget…\n\nThe narcissist you see during the discard. The narcissist you see disconnected and unhinged because you haven’t left after they’ve finished their meal of you and are now ready to leave your life…\n\nThat was them all along \n\nThey knew who they were all along \n\nThey’ve done this their whole lives \n\nThey will do it again really soon \n\nIf you let them re-enter your life, they will do it to you again. \n\nLastly and chiefly, don’t attack yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. You are just as wonderful as your narc thought you were in the beginning. There is nothing you could have done to stop it, except give them supply until you become a skeleton. There is only thing that keeps a narc happy.\n\nMore supply. More bodies. More attention. More than one person can give, \n\nSo they have multiple. \n\nWhen they are ready to cut one off, it’s like cutting off a light switch. \n\nGoodbye, you. \n\nHello, new. \n\n",

        "Upvotes": 0,
        "Text": "My wife and I are going through this right now.  We have not seen our 23 y/o son now for over a year.  He lives here in the same city.  I am a therapist, an LCSW.  It is difficult to find people trained in this work.   \n\nI just wrote this.  If you have any thoughts or advice please.\n\nParent Alienation when their son is dating a narcissist/borderline\n\nThis information is transcribed by myself from a podcast by Teal Swan discussing the alienation that a parent will do to their child’s other parent.   I am substituting the names of the subjects to refer to the alienation of a boyfriend from his parents by his girlfriend.   \n\nBF alienation by a narcissist GF—what can his parents do?\n\nAlienation of the BF turns that child against his parents, because it serves her, the GF’s personal agenda to do so.  What you want to strive for in a relationship, is supporting your partner in ALL their relationships—with his family and his friends.  That can only broaden your boyfriend and his life, and both your lives together.  It is terrible for a son to be caught in the middle between his girlfriend and his parents.   This happens by the GF talking negatively to the BF about his parents, or withholding that BF from his parents.   It is extremely damaging to that BF.  His parents mean a lot to him his whole life, with their love and support.\n\nShe is taking away what he has identified himself with for his whole life.   This is who he is.  It can put the child at war with himself.  Who he loved and believed in is not who he thought they were.  It cuts him down emotionally.  Who he was attached to and who he depended upon gets degraded.  \n\nIt can be an unconscious dynamic—complaining about the BF parents, complaining about her own parents, how parents can be bad or be controlling.   There can be a dynamic of the GF saying her parents are bad and abusive, so the BF must try to “save” the GF from her parents.  She cuts off the ability for him to share her parents with him—because she has made them out to be bad and not trusted also.\n\nShe projects her own attachment wounds and power struggle with her own parents onto her BF.  She portrays to him that she cannot live without him and only he can save her.  \n\nThis is a sophisticated abuse process.   It is carefully disguised.   The BF rejects and abandons his relationship with his own parents, and any friends or other support that he has.\n\nThis comes out of the GF’s attachment wounds in which she adapted and used triangulation to get her needs met in childhood.   GF is enmeshed with Mom, and Dad is “bad”, Mom needs to leave Dad.  That was the objective she took on from her attachment wounding.  \n\nGF continues to use the triangulation skills with BF.   She stays enmeshed with Mom, keeps Dad out and “is the bad guy”  , BF is in role to protect GF from Dad.   Though GF will not let BF have a relationship with Mom either, because any other relationship that he has besides herself is a threat and might be a threat to her enmeshment with Mom.   Ie, if BF was close to her mother, he could share what some of the GF’s bad behaviors she has with him.  Any relationship BF has besides GF is a threat to her—his energy would go elsewhere.\n\nThis is a form of abuse to the BF.   This is an abuse to his parents, who love him and now have no contact with him.\n\nIt is also a form of abuse to *her* parents.   They are afraid and acquiesce to her demands because she has had cutting or suicidal behaviors in her past.   Dad has become the “scapegoat” which continues the dynamic that the narcissistic daughter uses.  \n\nThe level of damage it has on the BF and to his parents is acute.   He must and needs to pull all attention to the GF.  He feels good about himself, because he is keeping her happy and alive.  His whole purpose gets pulled into her.  His self esteem falters, he loses his own self worth and his world shrinks.\n\nIn the past he was a hard worker and dedicated to his job.  He was motivated and passionate about law and criminal justice.   He loved his dog and was close to his extended family.  \n\nAfter this exposure, he cannot keep a job, he has no contact with his family.   His grandmother broke her leg, she is in a nursing home and he has not visited her for two years.  He states his dog, “is just a dog.”  \n\nEssentially this GF is alienating her BF from his whole everything that can be in his best interest.   GF protects her role as a victim.   She only thinks about her own best interests.  BF is at her beck and call.   \n\nThe enmeshment and walking on eggshells that the parents are doing keep the demands on her at a minimum.  \n\nShe has a therapist “she likes” and she only keeps one that she can keep in the dark, and won’t see the reality of how she is living in her narcissistic and alienating style to her BF and to her parents.  A therapist that knows about this triangulating behavior and begins to have the GF work on her deep attachment wounds will be fired by her.  It threatens the game she has used her whole life for her survival.  \n\nIf her parents push back there will be strong reactions from the GF—she will be placated and things turn back to the homeostasis of the triangulation.\n\nThis GF lacks any empathy for her BF and his parents.   She might even be sending messages on his phone that are critical and push away the parents.  She might take his phone and block any callers that might be a support to him—friends and family.\n\nShe will project her own traumas onto her BF and his childhood.  He will second guess his childhood.  She has no real view of the “other” and because of her narcissistic style, the BF will be in enmeshment to her.  His own boundaries and truths are lost. \n\nThe BF has became a pawn to the desire and whim of the GF.   When his parents try to make contact they don’t even recognize the person that he now is.  He has now become the facade and a reflection of the GF.   He is a puppet in a ventriloquist act, his authenticity is being suppressed.   He has had to give himself up from his parents, and cannot get any of his needs met by his parents.\n\nHe doesn’t even wear the same clothes.\n\nHe is not in a safe situation.  He has had to give up his love for his parents.  He has had to seclude himself away from the love of his parents and his friends and his desire to be close to them.   If he did NOT seclude himself away from his resources, there would be retaliation by the GF.  \n\nHe would be treated as though he were betraying her.  He would be treated as an enemy.  He is essentially a hostage to her.   There can be no differentiation of himself from the GF.   He is emotionally and mentally a hostage to her.  This deep level of alliance to her, (now that he has had a bad childhood also) will feel really good and safe.   If he reaches out to his support, friends or family there will be an extreme reaction by the GF which does NOT feel safe.  \n\nTo some, on the outside, this relationship will look like a good one.   It really is a codependent one.  \n\nNarcissists always need someone to be codependent to them.   \n\nThe parent might see their son, but he really is no longer present. \n\nThis GF is NOT a safe individual.   This is not seen by the codependent BF.   He is staying with her for his own survival.  He cannot even see out of it to reach his hand out for help.\n\nTo be safe, BF can ONLY stay separate from his parents.   He has had to adopt her complete narrative.\n\nIt is hell for the parents of their son.  It is the most extreme gaslighting there is.\n\nThe GF must be seen by everyone around her as the “good guy”.  She will even begin to complain to her mother about the BF.   There needs to always be the dynamic of her good—other person bad.  There becomes the triangulation between GF, her mother and her BF; just like she has with Mom and with Dad.\n\nIt is all about manipulation.  This will also keep the enmeshed mother away from BF.\n\nIt is all about the Dad or the BF being the bad one, and she needs to be protected.  \n\nGF has held Dad hostage and she also has held BF hostage.\n\nIt is an olympic level triangulation game.  The purpose is to divide.  People don’t realize they are being triangulated for one glaring reason, the GF never makes it obvious she is turning someone against another to get her needs met.   It is done as gaslighting.   It is done so that she will not have to take responsibility for herself and her own deep wounds.   They will lie and do anything so their tactic will not be seen.\n\nThey will use the other persons triggers and any actual issues that might be there.  \n\nThey play the insecurities of the other person to their favor.   They take whatever flaw Dad might have had, and use that.   Dad might have done something that was immature or made a mistake, so the narcissist uses this to highlight the importance of showing up better in the most extreme ways in which he won’t hold the child accountable.    She takes any insecurity the BF might have—how he always wants “justice”—so she uses that to get him to jump in and save her from harm.\n\nIt is NOT normal for a child to reject parents, so getting the BF to reject his parents is a BIG thing.  It is not normal!   It goes against biology.   We are a relationship species and a child has a bond with their parents.    If this son will not reach out to his parents because he might have been hurt—it is not from a normal relationship process.\n\nFor the GF to triangulate from her father is a rejection that is NOT normal.   It is biology to stay connected.   Children will want to stay connected to a parent even if they are abusive.  Dad had made a youthful mistake and for his daughter to reject and to spend her life trying to get her mother to leave her father is not normal.  It is a critical attachment wound adaptation that is 100% unhealthy.  The attachment wound she suffered has transformed into a personality disorder of borderline/narcissist.\n\nMuch of the behavior from the daughter is an externalized trauma re-creation or re-expression.  There is a repetition component when it comes to trauma.  She was a victim of trauma in her relationship with her parents in her childhood.  She has not worked through that trauma.   At the deep subconscious level this old feeling of being the victim to that parent is a relational dynamic.  She is acting out that trauma onto her own relationship.   In this case her father was taken away, she became enmeshed with Mom, because Dad was not available, he was the “cause “ to Mom’s worry, therefore Dad is bad.   Dad comes back, with stronger love and support than ever and is very remorseful for his bad choice as a young man, and wants to show up.   That love is rejected by the daughter, because her trauma brain still see this parent as the bad one.  This is the story that she continues to push.   Her own attachment security is frail and therefore she must be a victim and require complete attention from anyone that can love her.   So much so that she must make sure that person would never see her insecurity and she is the good one, and all attention must come to her and no-one else.    Not even her BF’s family or friends.  \n\nThis is a lose-lose situation for the BF.  He is in a lose situation with the GF because he has lost his differentiation and he is in a lose situation with his parents and friends because he does not have them anymore.  They are there for him still, but he has to cut them off for safety.\n\nHe has become a pawn to her triangulation.   He has become an accessory to the attack to his parents.  He will gain safety and security from the GF by going against his own parents.  He is proving his allegiance to her by carrying out the attacks that she does on his parents.   He starts to behave in hostile and abusive ways to all those people who loved him.  \n\nIf the parents react to that hostility, the son and GF use that as proof that his parents are bad people and must be stayed clear of.   Any response the parents have will be used by the GF and the son.   That is one reason that the GF will abduct the communication to the parents via his cell phone or emails and she will do the direct communication to his parents.   Some might even be erased and not seen by the BF.    Only the parents reaction will be seen by the BF.   \n\nHe is totally “gone”.   \n\nAll the power and control is held by the narcissistic GF.   \n\nParents have lost their son.  There is no way for them to build their relationship back with him while he is in relationship with the GF.  They cannot even talk to their son, he is not there.  He is not safe and is not in a safe situation.   \n\nThe son needs to be protected and put into a safe situation.   To do this, it cannot done by going against the GF in a power struggle.  That will not work.  It is not a straight forward process because of the lack of ability in the therapy field.  It can make the BF feel unsafe from the GF.  It can make them more unsafe and he believes they will harm him more.\n\nBF is in a “spell”.  To break that spell with logic and reason will not work.  He is deeply engaged in a coping mechanism.  \n\nWe as parents cannot continue to go “along” and “agree” with this dynamic.  It continues to put our son in an unsafe space.   \n\nEverything would continue as it is, everyone, his parents, her parents, himself are all being controlled and the game continues.\n\nGiving into this system keeps the status quo and contributes to the narrative that his parents are bad.   “They don’t care”.  “They don’t try to contact him.”   Her Dad continues to try to jump through hoops because he is the scapegoat, and that plays into the GF still being placated to.\n\nBF will not wake up and see the situation until he is out of the situation.     \n\nThe disfunction stays.   The system must change for anything to change.\n\nIt has to be methodical.  It is not a problem to be minimized.   \n\nThis is a very abusive relationship.\n\nThere needs to be the proper support in the mental health system.   Appropriately trained mental health therapists can see through this game.  A vast number of professionals are not trained in this alienation/triangulation.\n\nThere are huge smokescreens and manipulations that must be seen through.\n\nA massive red flag is that one parent is all bad and one parent is good (GF); and that both parents of the BF are all bad.\n\nProfessionals must be chosen that are trained in the dynamic of alienation and triangulation.\n\nAll training for therapists and psychologists is not the same.   This is a specialty.  \n\nThe system that is taking place has to be changed.  \n\nThe narrative needs to be contradicted.   Dad is a super Dad that takes the high road.  His love is also done with appropriate boundaries.   He will not be the scapegoat any longer.   He can even take great pride with how he made a mistake and he turned his life around so that he can and does show up.   And he does.  His being is enough.  He does not have to overdo or bend over backwards.   \n\nAny negative talk about Dad must be immediately halted by Mom.  She can immediately recount the *correct* narrative.   “Your Dad is amazing, he is the best Dad you could ever have.” \n\nThat same form of debasement must not be matched.   The Triangle stops here.   Don’t triangulate back.   \n\nNo-one, including the GF is playing this game for fun.  It is a game of survival. Remember they are replaying their old trauma.   It is a social attachment nightmare. \n\nAll involved need to do their own deep healing work.   This work is essential for YOU to break through from any of your old patterns.  There is the possibility of a much better relationship with your child than you could have EVER had.    \n\nResearch and connect to professionals.   Resources and people are there to assist you.  \n\nThree very powerful things prevail in the universe:  They are Love, Truth, and the drive to heal.\n\nThe lid can blow off of this dynamic.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

        "Text": "Let me explain. \nSo I (24F) had surgery on my knee and I was at my parents place recovering they were taking care of me. This is five hours from where me and my bf (27M) life. If I needed to return home for anything my dad would drop me off at my bf’s mum’s house (located halfway) and then my bf would pick me up and drive us home from there. The last time I was due to return that was the plan so I thought. Until my dad told me he will take me the whole way so my parents could help me get settled in do some shopping for me help me organise my house so I could survive without them lol. I told my bf as soon as my dad told me that they’ll drive me up so I won’t need picking up. He got angry at this and blamed me for poor planning and organisation and implied I lacked competence. This is because has he known earlier, he would’ve gone home the weekend prior to see his family, but he didn’t do that because he thought I was returning the following weekend so he would see them then. So he was annoyed that he didn’t go see his family and that was my fault apparently. He said I need to better plan and organise things and communicate with him properly (even though I told him as soon as the plan changed like 5 days in advance but that wasn’t god enough for him), that he doesn’t feel like we’re a team, that he feels left out of the loop… It was very tense and he was not communicating kindly with me at all regarding how he felt towards “what I had done”. So that was that we spoke about it in detail and moved on.\n\nThings were good, he had asked me last week to take him to the garage after work on Tuesday to pick up his car. I said no problem I will! Tuesday comes I didn’t hear anything from him. We both finish work at half 3, I decided I would meal prep before going to see my girls at 6. Then I remembered I couldn’t do that because I was taking my bf to the garage. I messaged him at 4 asking if he wants me to take him still (because he never mentioned it that day) and he replied 30 minutes later saying no his friend would do it. I was annoyed because had he told me earlier I could’ve done my meal prep. But that’s not a huge deal, the reason I was mostly annoyed was from the parallels I drew between this situation and the situation he was incredibly frustrated and mean towards me for. I said to him “you could’ve told me earlier”. He replied “sorry my bad” and proceeded to message about other things. I sent a message in summary explaining that I’m annoyed because if you had told me earlier I would’ve had enough time to get other stuff done, and considering how you treated me when you believed I hadn’t communicated properly to you, it feels like a double standard in expectations surrounding communications and plans changing. He didn’t like this, he replied “Jesus I did it one time. I didn’t tell you cos I was in non stop meetings all day. I’m sorry but if you had other things to do you could’ve asked not jump on my case as soon as I do one little thing.” I then explained that I did ask, and it’s fair for me to point out the double standard considering how I was treated over the same topic. He then said “whatever. You get away with murder compared to that. If I brought up every little thing I’d never stop”. I said well if I said I didn’t like xyz and then I did it, it would be fair for you to point it out. He then said he’s going out, I said enjoy and he’s ignored me since then… \n\nIs this narc behaviour other people have experienced or is he just not a nice person, or was I wrong to even say anything? I was starting to think I was wrong to say anything… \n\nTLDR: called my bf out on hypercritical behaviour and he flipped it on me, making it out like I’m overreacting and then has ignored me since ",

        "Text": "After you’ve been discarded, after you find out you’ve been used and abused, you lie awake with the symptoms any person going through withdrawal will. It will be hard to eat. Hard to sleep. You’ll be ruminating about what happened. Completely obsessed. \n\nWhat you don’t realize is the emotions you feel, the confusion, the lack of confidence, the need for validation, lacking control: that’s how the narcissist feels every day. \n\nOf course, they are not going through withdrawal because this is their life. This is what they are used to. So they have made their peace with it. They have mitigation mechanisms for it, and they have a false persona to mask it. \n\nThat’s who you met. That’s who you fell in love with. \n\nBut it is not the true person within. \n\nBy nature, the narcissist is obsessive. They lack confidence. They lack object constancy, and they have a deep seated need to control their surroundings. They have a crippling fear of failure and exposure. They are childlike spiritually because of abuse and/or neglect from their caregivers as a child. They are trapped in a trauma cycle. That’s why external validation is their lifeline. They are seeking the validation and healthy bonding they never got as a child. \n\nOnce they get it, they’re duty bound to destroy it. \n\nWhy? Their caregivers hurt them or neglected them, and they want to break the cycle by breaking you. \n\nThat’s why right after lovebombing, you’re ready to cook for them, clean for them, give up all your money. They want you to provide for them and regulate them. \n\nThe way their mommy should have but did not. \n\nYou know how you feel if you are in that discard stage, or how you felt when you were there. How it is one of the most terrible emotional states you’ve ever experienced. How it feels like grieving the death of someone you love and withdrawal from substance abuse all at the same time. \n\nThe narcissist is a mirror. Whatever emotions they have, so too will you.\n\nOnce they are unmasked, once they reach their final contemptuous form where they are so sick of you they no longer care to lie, you are just as low as they. Just as vulnerable and childlike. \n\nBringing you down to their level at the end gives them the fuel they need to discard you and monkey branch. \n\nBecause the narcissist is a coward by nature.\n\nAs you heal, it’s natural to ask yourself a million “why?” Questions. \n\nWhen your mind takes you there, remind yourself that the unbearable, dark, forlorn, isolated, scared, tumultuous low place they sent you to \n\nIs every day life for them. \n\nThat’s why they need positive bright good natured people \n\nTo devour for a moment \n\nTo get a little relief from the nightmare they have within them. \n\nThey literally have to eat beauty and transfer energy \n\nTo distract themselves from the feeling of being discarded in perpetuity.\n\nThat’s why Hoovers sometimes take many months or many years\n\nThey need you fully recharged \n\nSo you’re a good fuel source for them to devour all over again.\n\nThat’s why they have to cheat on you and make sure backup supply is on deck\n\nThey don’t want to feel like you do right now\n\nLiving in permanent discard.

Which means he absolutely thinks I am too! So, there are groups online where you can meet people and I did. We all started talking, long story short, a girl in the chat told her friend everything that was said and she told my bf. Who is now my x bc he wants nothing to do with me and thinks I trashed his name but I just sent a pic asking if anyone knew him as she said she was from the same town. So now, I am discarded for life , called a pest bc I kept wanting to understand why and he wouldn’t tell me at first, called annoying and told to never contact or I’ll get police called on me. \n\nIt’s mind blowing how much Iv accepted and tried to push thru and stay positive and now bc of that I’m yet again wrong and thrown away. Be real with me people, was I wrong for sending a pic into the chat and asking if anyone knew? No real slander was mentioned, but I guess it’s just the point. Idk I just feel dumb. ",

        "Text": "At all times, gaslighting mainly. I have to vent, I never really talk about my specific encounters but you know so many times you are talking to yourself out loud to make sure you don't slip out of reality? This is one of those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy nex seems to follow some of reddit accounts so she sees a lot of my posts here. She takes them very personally and considers it an \"attack\". I'm not mentioning names of course and YES I am allowed to talk about my experiences, my life, online or with anybody I want, period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo about a month ago when she left our 12 year marriage in ONE DAY because I would no longer accept anything less than a true apology for her transgressions, she said \"There is nothing left for me here\" and walked out with my stepdaughter. Now I knew that apology wasn't coming (she gave me the I'm sorry I'm just not good enough for you) this is why I was crying daily for a month straight because I had made up my mind the only way I will continue to be with her is an apology, accountability and talk of how she is going to change this behavior. We know this wouldn't happen so I was grieving hard, she had done a 60day silent treatment cycle alongside insulting me and demanding divorce each time I tried to talk. After 12 years of the same it was the last straw. Yes i could write 6 books on all the things that were done and said to me. Yes she walked out the door that day but in reality I left her. I knew exactly what would happen for me demanding a healthy marriage with accountability and growth. I made the decision to end the marriage and I do not regret it, I promised myself I would never allow it to happen again. If she cant admit to it, she cant change any of it, she cant apologize, she feels no remorse. That's why i was tore up the entire month before while she ignored my crying for 45 straight days. OUCH, that hurts to say out loud.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what always got her more upset than ANYTHING was me talking about it. Here. She would say how could I love her and say such horrible things about her lmao. She would work to get me banned from various selfhelp/abuse subs. It really is personal to her. Me describing things I'm going through in my marriage was a personal attack on her. So since she left she has come back or called 3-4 different times crying acting like she wants to reconcile (manipulation) but then will back off and start blaming me for our failed marriage because I'm here saying \"horrible things about her\" She will say she was in a weak moment and I am attacking her and not taking accountability LMAO. These attacks being anything I've posted here or on reddit in general since shes left. Its about CONTROL, why do they think they are clever? These attempts are beyond pathetic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe person simply cant understand that what I say here, how I feel about her is 100% COMPLETELY on HER. We develop our feelings towards other people based on what THEY show us, how THEY treat us. You don't think someone's an asshole because they have blue eyes, its because they treat you with disrespect. Now i know this is common sense, but again just venting. I've told her so many times you want me to stop posting there? You want me to stop reading all these books and watching videos and purchasing all this recovery material? SO DO I, JUST STOP ACTING THIS WAY. Right? How clear can one be? How simple of a solution is that? Just SHOW ME you love me, SHOW ME you care, all she cares about is what I THINK, without doing anything to change my thinking. Once you have shown me who you are, once you have treated me REPEATEADLY with malice and disrespect it is on YOU to change my formed opinion of you. Its what we all do with all of our friends or family or lovers...we APOLOGIZE and show them it will not happen again by not doing those actions again. Its all designed to silence you. I will not be silenced and I told her I will no longer be INVALIDATED. She would love to use the reactions as justification for the next abusive round, she had DARK energy though, guys she could go 3-4 weeks of raging at me, wearing me out until I finally snap and BAM, I need to take accountability for what I said LMAO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther more if she really wanted to show me anything and she follows this, my posts are a cheat code to my heart. I lay it out exactly as I feel, what went wrong, EXACTLY what I want to see in order to fix it. If it were me Id just read this and do what I long for and I'm yours again! Easy! Especially since all I'm asking for is respect and accountability. If roles were reversed and I had upset my wife but then found a post detailing her feelings and what she wants/needs to make it right!? Phew jackpot right? She's batshit insane and I grieved so many years knowing that I would never get any type of love or connection from her. Also trying to keep you AWAY from selfhelp stuff, punishing them for talking, reading, researching learning and growing? If it had anything to do with abuse that material was an attack on her. I guess the purpose is to keep away from recognizing what is happening to you. Thats beyond fucked up. They want you to stay stuck with them in their permanent little shitty world where they fight everyday for attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRant over, its just so easy to be with me or fix this marriage before I sign these divorce papers, but I am not surprised, I feel validated each time she does this, it has happened every single time for 10 years straight it is not changing now nor will it ever, it only increases my resolve of how unhealthy and abusive she is and also gives me strength knowing I left everything out on the table, worked for years to fix things and they are actively working against me, trying to stay stuck. I know she didnt love me, I know cant give nay love or even have the slightest idea what CONSTITUTES love. Because I lived it and I loved her, yet I was never able to get what I gave. I deserve so much better and will zero problems getting someone much better than her. I know my worth and what I have to offer and honestly I'm a pretty good catch. Im already turning down dates. When she would project her shame I did feel bad for her, wanted to help her through it but after years of the same shit \"you're nothing, you're worthless, I hate you, I've never hated anyone as much as you, nobody loves you, nobody has ever loved you, your father was right to leave you, you'll die sad and alone ETC\" After so long and 100s of times you become disgusted. Not really feeling bad for them anymore that she hates herself because she deserves to hate herself, she's pathetic and for some reason cannot do a single thing to change who she is. Its so BIZZARE how transparent it is and they really think they are clever or intelligent. I stayed because of denial and some insecurities I had to work on. But I never believed her, I never thought the problem was me however I did think at times I could make her stop by outloving her. Meaning doing everything I can and that DOES work for quite some time as you are giving them what they want, the admiration and attention why ignoring your own needs and concentrating solely on making them happy. But that burns out as we eventually burn out from no reciprocation. I would eventually fall into something I was working on or interested in for weeks in order to block out what's really going on, this would cause her to get angry as I'm not giving her all my attention and thr cycle starts anew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd still even now all it would take is a true apology and admit you treated me terrible and that you want to change and save our family. That's it, and they CANT, they are INCAPABLE. I've seen her get close a few times and then her words get jumbled up and she gets nervous and then looks away and its just like omg..you really cant do it. That to me is the saddest part of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey want to control your thoughts so your mind is focused on WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR THEM. If any of you doubt yourself this is about as clear cut case you can get. Just ask them to show you different, stop the behavior, there's your proof you are free to give up on them. I know there a ton of men here who had covert females and its the same story. Attack all day and then play victim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to rant as I never usually get into personal details but I dont think I care to hide them anymore? It just is what I know it is and always will be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove you guys, stay up Kings, and for my Queens remember you are not alone.",

I realized I still miss him and I still love but no I cannot allow myself to feel those things. He abandoned me when I needed him the most, right after I had a hysterectomy last year, he claimed I told him I didn't want to talk to him, I was on a lot of medication and don't remember any of this unfortunately, but still someone who really cares would still have tried to be there for you and called you the next day and been like hey I know you Said not to contact you but I also know you're on a alot of medication and I just wanted to see how you were doing. He did none of those things instead he didn't talk to me for 2 months. Then he apologizes and I take him back and the love bombing ensues, then we get into a fight because he was talking down to me and being rude and I basically went off and cursed at him and told him do not ever speak to me that way. I went no contact and well here we are almost 6 months later, I'm angry he's trying to ACT like the victim, when I'm the victim, I'm angry that it seems he so easily moved on as if he never really cared about me and I never really mattered I'm angry that he wasn't there for me and he treated me like shit and yet I'm the bad guy for standing up for myself. And finally I'm angry for still having feelings for him, I hate it and I don't want to love him anymore he doesn't deserve my love, or anyone else's love for that matter because he doesn't know how to cherish it.

I am with everyone who is going through this pain and I understand your pain as I suffered it. Hope you all come out of it soon. And I want to add one more thing those who suffer with them and are scared to leave them still leave them as they will cause you pain and nothing else.

        "Text": "I’ve been talking to a lot of survivors that are far along in their healing journey but are still holding on to the guilt and the culpability given to you by your narc. \n\nOver the course of the relationship, a narc wears you down then guilt trips you into being responsible for carrying everything in their life they don’t want to. It could be a menial task, it could be what’s for dinner, it could be registering them to vote, or it could be their hatred for themselves. Once you reach 6 months plus it’s likely all of the above. \n\nYour narc has told you that you didn’t cut the light switch on fast enough, or your pancake needed more banana, or you should have stomped the grapes in the wine harder. \n\nThe first step to putting down those burdens is recognizing they don’t belong to you. \n\nYou are not responsible for anyone else’s happiness. You cannot make someone else unhappy. Happiness comes from within. If someone has unresolved trauma or a personality disorder, nothing you can do will make them happy.\n\nDon't believe me? Ask that narc what brings them lasting joy. Ask them to describe the steps they took to heal from what they describe in their trauma dumps. \n\nAt the bitter end of my relationship i was told I made the narc unhappy. I didnt provide them with peace. I didn't do enough, that I wasn't enough, that I wasn't \"her person\".\n\nNow that I can rationalize, I see that it's the dumbest excuse for abusive behavior, and it's perfect for a victim. You are already downtrodden and damaged. I am 100% sure everyone else she told that ran away carrying that forever.\n\nIm not holding on to that shit! \n\nIt is she who weaponizes \"I love you.\" Because it is a tool of coercion for her.\n\nIt is she who is transactional. It is she who has no problem telling two or more people “I love you” and manipulating both of them. \n\nIt is she who incited all the chaos with her lack of ability to handle simple criticism, never able to admit to being wrong. \n\nIt is she who gave me a never ending task list. She would get upset if I did everything on it and point to “baseboards” still dirty even though I’ve never seen her clean one one once. \n\nLove is altruistic. Love is kind. Love endures. Love doesn’t keep lists. Love doesn’t keep file cabinets. Love is forgiving. \n\nMy ex pwNPD isn’t capable of longevity in any of those things. It can only be feigned in moments, and then the default setting of selfishness will re-emerge. \n\nDr Les Carter was talking about how some greater narcissists have no rock bottom. They can go lower and lower infinitely. \n\nNow that you are aware, why are you still on that guilt trip they sent you on? \n\nSet down the post cards at their gift shop and come home. \n\nUse your brain. This person has a personality disorder. They cannot love.\n\nThe narc has told you that you are inadequate and you are lacking when all the hallmarks of this disorder are deficits. \n\nIf you say it out loud it’s completely nonsensical \n\nSo let go of the projection. You are enough. You did enough. Your love is enough. You are kind enough, you are caring and loving enough. \n\nThink about it. Is your narc capable of providing the services and supply they expected out of you? \n\nThere is your answer, and you were shown the evidence. \n\n",

Ohio just let my case sit for 8 months until I made a call and explained for probably the 5th time that the order will need to be carried out in Kentucky. They finally transfer it to Kentucky and it takes a couple of months, but the order is finally in the system and support is automatically being taken out of my ex’s check. I was getting a paper check for $100 every couple of weeks. He paid $200 a month for three years out of the system and just sent the funds directly to me. \n\nOut of nowhere I got a letter from Kentucky saying my case was closed. I called my caseworker and she didn’t know what happened. She did a little investigating and found out Kentucky sent a request to Ohio to close the complaint, but Ohio closed the entire case instead. I haven’t received support since February. I know it’s only been a couple months, but I’m feeling it already. \n\nMy ex sent me a text about 2-3 weeks ago asking me if I knew what happened with child support—he was super nice and asked that we keep things out of the system and said that they’re good the way they are — and I simply stated that the case would be reopened with a pending modification within about 30 days (I’m filling out new paperwork now).  He went off about an hour later saying he couldn’t wait to be done with it all so he could live his life and have a little money in his pocket. I didn’t respond and I immediately called BS. \n\nHe is a pathological liar and a narcissist. My child has reached out so many times trying to have a relationship with him and he just keeps offering empty promises—sounds familiar. \n\nToday, my kid got on Facebook for the first time in a while and the first thing she sees is a Facebook post from my ex’s wife saying they (she and my ex) bought a brand new Mustang GT California Special. It’s become a running joke that my ex is Father of the Year.  \n\nMy ex fully supports our 21 year old child (who says his dad is a good person) and provides housing (lives with him and his wife), food, and who knows what else. Do you think my ex cares about how that makes my youngest child feel? No, I don’t think so. Selfish. Money is more important than people and he’s proved that time and time again. He thinks threatening me with a lawyer is going to scare me. You think you can abandon your child and get off scot free? You’re not.",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "After having a negative experience with yet another toxic person on reddit, I realized now might be a good time to post this reminder.\n\nA lot of times online, especially on reddit, you might come across someone who responds to your post or comment because they need the same positive or negative attention-seeking supply as an N. They do so to prop themselves up. They need validation. Then, if you don't do what they want, whatever that unspoken thing is, they spiral into the same type of rage as an N and display similar behaviors.\n\nBecause they're stuck online, they can only respond to hurt you with a smear campaign... an attempt to tear you down and make you seem like you're unstable, misinformed, untrustworthy, etc. in a sub or other forum, especially if it's one where you seem to know quite a bit about the topic and they want that sort of attention only for themselves or, at the very least, for you to praise their level of knowledge. \n\nIt's okay to stop responding directly to them. They're going to get pissed either way when you don't acknowledge them in the way or ways they hope. If you push back, and many do, they're going to just keep twisting words and performing actions to get attention and make you look inferior. They're going to attempt to discredit you.\n\nThey want to look great online. They want people to admire them. If you don't, then they're going to do everything in their power to make you look bad to prop up themselves. It's DARVO. It's N rage.\n\nDon't feed it. Block them.\n\nOf course, what do you do when their comments remain or they add or subtract to them to make you look bad? It's okay for you to respond, btw, in your own comment with an edit about their bad behavior and that you blocked them. But what do you do if they then mimic you rather than just leave you alone, as you likely already asked more than once? What happens when they add a response because they were able to see your edit either right before you blocked or via another account?\n\nStop responding in any way to them at that point.\n\nMake them seethe from having lost you. To be clear, they might say extremely sick things in their follow up comments. They might refer to you intimately, in a non-sexual fashion, by referring to you with the word \"my\" or talking about \"our.\" Both are signs of delusional thinking and an attempt at control and to have a place in your sphere. They might again try to present you as mentally unstable with a lot of loaded language commonly used by online trolls. \n\nReddit will trick you by saying \"out of sight, out of mind\" after you block them. So, since you can't see it, you're fine right?\n\nNo. Because, at least in the sub where it happened, others will continue to read the other person's comments and some will potentially believe them. Your online reputation can take a hit. That person might even push hard hoping you'll delete all of your comments. These types really love to downvote and harass, and sometimes get others to help, until their target leaves a sub entirely or even has to build a new reddit or other forum account to escape the harassment.\n\nDon't fall prey. You can always check someone you blocked in Incognito mode to see if they stopped or kept trying to tear you down. That said, don't keep responding or even looking at their profile or the thread after the first day it happens. If necessary, add an update to your original comment, but then leave it be. If others start to pile on, submit the harassment to mods.\n\nThese people are toxic beyond belief. When someone has to use reddit or any forum to make themselves look superior and to attempt to damage the reputation of someone who didn't do what they wanted in terms of attention and praise, it shows that they are the actual unstable and, more importantly, toxic person.",

Narcissists use coercion, gaslighting, guilt, trauma dumps, and other insidious control measures to shape you into their minion and psychological concubine. Lovebombing is irresistible on purpose. Once you accept the shared fantasy they are ready to strip you down to rebuild you to their liking. \n\nIt is conscious and compulsory on their part? Yes, it is. They may not look in the mirror and say “I’m looking for a fool to manipulate” but they understand the impacts. They know they’re surrounded by perceived loyalists who are terrified of their wrath should they step out of pocket. That includes or included you at some point.\n\nNow that you’re aware of narcissistic abuse, you need to unlearn that behavior. Step one is moving away from them and cutting off contact. If you have children this is an obstacle but if you do not have kids you have to get space. Time will not heal this wound. If you sit around you’ll remain vulnerable to Hoovers and lovebombing will put you right back into that cycle. \n\nBy the discard or reverse discard you are locked in and obsessed. You’ve rearranged your life for your narc. You found the time and space to make your entire life about them. \n\nNow you’ve got to do the opposite. You have to become fixated on no contact. You have to remove the hope of change, because narcissists are beyond repair. They are not capable of redemption. So you can’t wonder about the maybe. All the dreams they gave you from future faking you need to remind yourself that they were fake. \n\nRuminate on your future happy self. Become obsessed with winning and being victorious over this situation. Some days will be better than others of course. \n\nYou have shown yourself that you will move heaven and earth to be with someone else. When you got a bread crumb you became a rock star and did more than you’ve ever done to keep someone who is scientifically proven to be a bore and lack human qualities for. Become obsessed with how you can use your newly discovered abilities for yourself. \n\nPlan dates with yourself. Plan vacations with yourself. Start selling yourself dreams of things you can do on your own. \n\nYour narc is not a prize. They are literal human vampires that need other human beings to regulate themselves. They are cold blooded and need your warmth to heat themselves up. Like a reptile. \n\nNow you know you are that warmth. You are the energy source. Become obsessed with harnessing your own energy. Fantasize about how you’ll win at life. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nThe more you focus on yourself, the weaker the trauma bond. The trauma bond is predicated on trust. It can only be maintained by someone you care about AND trust. Remind yourself that you are trustworthy and there is no narcissist on Earth that can be trusted. Remove the legs that trauma bond rests on.\n\nYour narc is a user. You need to learn how to use yourself to accomplish your new dreams but with the care and tenderness you deserve. You will never ever experience that with a narcissist. ",

If anything, this whole situation has brought me closer to my family, friends, & myself. He’ll never understand what true happiness is because he’s never experienced it, & I don’t think he ever will. He constantly is chasing for “the next best thing” & can’t be grateful for what he already has. He always needs more. I honestly feel sorry for him. But after what he did to me, he doesn’t deserve my empathy. ",

I loved her so much and that was my only \"intent\" of being with her- to love her. and I am holding onto that. the idea that I hurt her in any form is actually killing me. I haven't been able to eat or sleep really in weeks. it is so hard not to internalize her words. I need to go no contact. there's no excuse\n\n\\- told me I was selfish/ can only talk about myself when I talked to her about grieving my grandmother passing/ crying over my mother's cancer diagnosis \n\n\\-read my texts on my phone multiple times while I was blackout drunk (after she would get me wasted). she did admit to this but never apologized and then held my texts with my friends over my head for months after the fact (my friends were encouraging me to break up with her in the texts. this was two months into dating btw)\n\n\\- said multiple times how every hard conversation we have is just me \"bagging on her\" when I would just be asking for better treatment so out relationship could prosper and we could stay together.\n\n\\-told me I make her feel like she's a bad person\n\n\\- called the cops on me when I was grieving my grandmother because she was scared I was going to hurt myself (this was never something I expressed thought over doing) \n\n\\-humiliated me in front of our friends by talking about our sex life in a really nasty manner. told me it was a \"joke\" when I told her it hurt my feelings. then started to ignored me / turned on the TV mid conversation \n\n\\-made me count her money w her/ said to me multiple times \"do you know how much money I make?\" when she knew I was a broke student working full time and barely getting bye\n\n\\-held money over my head. would buy me things such as concert tickets/ decorations for our house then accuse me of taking advantage of her/ using her \"wallet as a pillow\" .her words. \n\n\\- told me I was projecting when I would say it felt like she didn't love me \n\n\\- told me after coming home at 4 am after drinking all night she had \"a great night because she spent it with strippers\" then when I brought up to her how this hurt me, it turned into her typical \"you make me feel like im a terrible person\" \n\n\\- when she would get mad at me would ignore me for days/ refuse to talk to me or have a conversation about it \n\n\\- would lie to me about events we both experienced which would make me feel absolutely fucking insane (gaslighting yeah now I know) \n\n\\- left me alone out in an alley behind a bar after I smoked weed/ got incredibly sick and had a bad high. Got mad at me for having a bad high/ being quiet around her friends. then when we got home said \"sorry I just wanted to hang out with my friends not take care of you\" \n\n\\-got mad at me because we only hung out with her friends but she actively disliked/ would make threats about my best friends \n\nThis is only some of it. I am remembering more each day but it's like I blacked out and have brain fog surrounding our entire 9 months together. \n\nThe point is to ask- was this emotional abuse? Narcissistic abuse? I am having so much trouble validating myself. My friends said it was abuse 3 months into the relationship but I was so in love with her- am so in love with her. I ignored it all. I am fighting going back every day. There was also some physical stuff but I attribute that to her being drunk honestly. I don't think it was intended. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Some mentally ill people stalk me and always try to get around, using info they got about me and my past trauma, chat or sit next to me for their weird purposes, like to \"watch me\" and mostly it's related to their sex life I guess because they called it \"sex\" or whatever about it. To be straight, they hate me out of the blue for absolutely nothing I ever done. Just because. They can attack me in a store or any public place (its usually staff) and say i stole something, threaten to me and do anything to just psychologically abuse and treat me like a shit. And they usually do it only to me.\n\nThey always saying to me who they see me, it's a ton of unpleasant bullshit and they try to manipulate the narcissistic way to make me believe i am like this. Since they dont do any crimes I can't report them. They can just sit next and STARE or not even stare, just make an impression what they sit near for.\n\nEven if I'll be rude to them or say what they do, like to pervs, they don't stop doing this. If I will ignore, it gets only worse too. Just like with narc. But I can't get to safe space because they are all around and it continues in different countries.\n\nI'm not sure if they do exactly it to somebody else. But they usually know too much about me when I meet them for the first time. What fascinates me everybody notice it and only laugh at me, like if they are jealous. I honestly don't know what's wrong with others, like do I care, but again I have no idea how to behave when stalkers reach me.\n\nI got laughed before A LOT what it's \"because I want sex\" \"beautiful girl\" and such stuff but it's no more then a idea these mentally ill stalkers produce, for those who wants to write it under my post. But it does have something with a trauma I had with narcissistic parents and narcissistic ex. Which is not possible to discuss with any therapist right now because im moving and don't have money as well (or any options, countries im passing never have any theraposts who would help). It only affects the level how I can be more sensitive to any kind of shit people who come and say me the same shit very arrogantly and loud and keep repeating it to break my boundaries. To add, I'm in a very stressful environment and people around me aren't any friendly. And it's impossible for me to get any support because people around are like this, they only laugh at me and agree with these stalkers , typical narcissistic abuse situation. Or they pity me, in the best case. Or they are may be scared to talk to me because they will be threated the same? Online I'm only getting those stalkers again.\n\n(why I think they are stalkers? well I don't know anything about them but I was openly stalked (they told me that and proved to scary me, in my country from where im moving, and it was started by my shit family) before by some and these are similar, and whatever, just call them like this because why not)",

        "Text": "*** Extremely Long Post. No TLDR. Sorry ***\n\nI guess I'm just looking to vent. But if anyone would like to offer advice my ears and mind are open. \n\nTo start, I'm in my mid 40s. An old coworker that I'd consider a close friend mentioned me being single to his daughter and told her about me, knowing I'm a decent man who wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt her. She's in her mid 20s. I wouldn't normally date anyone that young but after talking for a few days she seemed to have a very mature head on her shoulders and we hit it off quite well. We started dating in October and things moved quickly. We didn't try to keep things slow. We just let it flow naturally and it naturally happened pretty quickly. She seemed to be all I have been looking for. Smart, funny, affectionate, kind, caring, loving, playful and flirty and many more things that I'd hoped to find in someone after  being divorced for 5 years after a 10yr marriage failed for not having much of any of the above. We moved in together in early February.\n\nFrom the very beginning I was upfront with her with all the things I'd consider my \"red flags\". I told her about long time female friends I have. Told her about financial issues I have gone thru and am still recovering from due to covid lay offs. Told her about my 3 former marriages (2 ending in divorce and 1 in death from a lost battle with Leukemia). And she was up front with me about her battles with anxiety and depression and her failed marriage and relationships due to infidelity and porn, etc... But things started happening that would cause arguments between us more and more frequently and it always came down to her saying \"I get in my head and over think things because of my anxiety and depression\" and she would apologize and admit that she shouldn't treat me how she was treating me to cause the argument and tell me it wasn't fair, etc... She was showing jealousy over how much time I'd spend at my ex's when I'd bring my kids back to her(which was very minimal time, just enough to talk about whatever was going on with the kids and I'd say my goodbyes and leave but in her mind, I guess she felt I still had feelings for my ex or wanted to have sex with her). She was showing jealousy over communications I'd have with my long-time female friends, of which there was never anything more than being friends - in fact one of them was a high school band mate and has now been together with one of my cousins for over 5 years. She would get upset with me for being on my phone whenever I would be typing things. Asking me who I was typing to or what was so important. Each and every time I would show her my phone for her to see it was a work email or an inquiry on a social media page or Google profile that I admin or moderate for an organization I volunteer for. I had nothing to hide from her yet she treated me like I was always trying to hide things or I was trying to do inappropriate things with other people. She would always try to look over my shoulder if I was on my phone. If she say my phone like up when we were sitting at the table or riding in the car she would try to read the notifications to see who was messaging me. \n\nAll of this started about a month after we started dating and continued for months. Each and every time it was the same argument over and over. I would ask why she was always digging into my personal affairs. Why was she always doubtful of me, second guessing me or mistrusting me. And the argument always ended the same way as I mentioned above with apologies for \"getting in her head\" and promises to not do it anymore and telling me I was right and that I didn't deserve to be treated how she was treating me. \n\nWhen we weren't arguing, things were great between us. But the constant feeling of mistrust and manipulation I was getting from her caused me to start distancing myself from her. I didn't feel that spark anymore. I wasn't as affectionate and intimate with her anymore. In early March we were laying in bed together looking at the phone bill on her phone and as a joke I said \"let's go see who you text all the time since you're always giving me a hard time about being on my phone\" and I pulled up the text usage on her phone line. She didn't say anything or try to stop me until the phone numbers popped up on the screen and at that point she said \"why are you doing this?\" To which I replied again that I was just doing it as a joke. Mind you, this was my AT&T account that I had agreed to let her add her line to my account so we could get a multi line discount. So I could have searched her phone and text records anytime I wanted. But I never felt like she was doing anything she shouldn't so I never felt the need to. I honestly was just attempting to be goofy to bring levity to her constant nosiness about my phone. However, when that list of numbers showed up and I noticed a particular number repeated a lot and at times when I wasn't around her, I of course got suspicious and asked her who it was. She readily admitted to me it was an old friend from before high-school who supposedly suffered from similar depression and anxiety issues and they'd keep in touch from time to time to check on each other. So while I still had her phone in my hands I went to her text messages. Sure enough there's the whole conversation with this random number. She didn't have him saved as a contact. I got to read some of the texts and I will admit that it did seem mostly innocent. Except for one thing. She was talking with this guy about our issues that caused the arguments. However she was making it all look like I was at fault and that I was mean and would yell a lot. Of course she never told him the things she did that started the arguments to begin with and of course, the guy would validate her untrue thoughts and tell her that I was wrong and she needed to dump me. She was seeking comfort and validation of her made up thoughts and insecurities. But there was a message from her to him that caused a whole other issue. She mentioned something to him that I only have ever mentioned to someone else either in person or in text. It was an inside joke between me and that other person that I never mentioned to her so she couldn't have known anything about it much less mentioned it. So I asked her how she knew about that topic and why she was talking about it with this guy. I accused her of somehow spying on me or having some kind of software on my phone to read my texts. \n\nWith the discovery of her talking to this guy about our intimate issues and now feeling like she was spying on me somehow, I got very angry. I told her to tell me how she is reading my texts and she admitted to me that she had been reading my texts on my apple watch while I was at work(I can't wear watches, rings or jewelery due to safety regulations where I work). I was devastated. I had never felt so betrayed and mistrusted and manipulated in my life. The reading of my texts behind my back was a major issue but her seeking comfort and validation with this guy amounted to an emotional affair in my book.  I made her pack a bag and get out and she went and stayed with her mom and sister for a couple nights. On the 3rd night she had to come get more clothes so I let her in and we started talking and I foolishly let her talk me into taking her back. (I know... I know... 😣😣).\n\nBut she couldn't stop the overthinking and arguments continued. Finally, in late March she sent me a text at work about something that again showed her doubting, 2nd guessing and distrusting me and I had finally had enough. I got very mad and after a couple hours of back and forth texts I told her to pack her shit and be out of the house by the weekend. I didn't talk to her the rest of that day until I got home. She immediately started trying to hug on me and tell me she was sorry and that she knows how how wrong she's been with all the arguments and things she's done and that she sees now that she can't keep doing it and promised that she won't do it anymore, etc... \n\nAll I kept saying was that we were finished. I was done. I no longer had feelings or that spark for her. I didn't want or desire her anymore. I didn't love her anymore. I continued to say it was over and she needed to pack her stuff and leave. She started to get angry because I wasn't giving in to her. She started asking \"Why was I being like this and why won't I give her a chance?\" And saying she wanted to prove to me that she can stop her behaviors and stop causing the arguments. I just said this was no longer about what she wants and this was only about what I want now and I no longer wanted us. She continued to get more and more angry and mad. She started yelling and getting in my face. It got very heated, to the point she was in my face screaming at me, asking the same things I mentioned above. I got up and got in her face and screamed the same things I mentioned I said above, over and over. The last thing I said was \"I don't love you anymore, just leave!\" I tried to turn around and walk away from her. \n\nShe grabbed my arm as I was walking away in an attempt to pull me back to her and try to hug me, I guess, but I continued walking away and yanked my arm away from her and out of her grasp. I then took the 3 or 4 steps it took to get to my sofa and as I was going to sit down she yells \"you hit me\" and \"I'm going to call my mom\". I didn't say a word. I was done with everything at that point. I didn't want to waste another nanosecond defending myself against her. She walked into the bedroom and got on the phone with who I assume was her mom. 5 minutes later she walked out the room, across the living room and out the back door. I could hear her talking still on the phone. At this point I calmed down. Calmed down enough to actually fall asleep on the sofa. I woke up about 30 minutes later to 2 cops standing in my living room along with her, her mom and sister. The cops asked me what happened. I explained to them everything as I explained it above. They didn't ask me anything about if I got physical with her but I was then put in cuffs and arrested for \"Battery of a Dating Partner\" and spent the next 24hrs in jail. Due to the charge an automatic protective order was issued against me. I haven't been able to talk to her or anyone she knows to try to figure out why she did this. In the weeks since, I've learned to accept that I may never know why.\n\nI go to court on May 21 and see what awaits for me. ",

        "Text": "My mother is a narcissist and my dad is just cruel and abusive. When I was in graduate school and depressed and didn’t know if I wanted to stay they called the police on me when I was at their house and I needed support. While I was sitting at the kitchen counter crying in disbelief that they would call the police, my mom secretly took out her phone and started video taping me crying so she could send me a video of me crying to “show me what a mess I am”.  Just sick and cruel. Of course I was crying that they would call the police on me. The cop took me outside and said he would leave and never give my parents the satisfaction of knowing I ever wanted to even be there with parents how are so awful. Then they emailed me a week later saying I hope I learned my lesson and did I want to hang out for the Fourth of July (???) I didn’t really speak to them again in any real way after that. It took me a long time to realize how abusive they are/were and that even though they’re my parents I don’t owe them anything. They’re constantly trying to punish me even though I’m an adult. They’re also VERY sexist. I financially support myself and haven’t taken money from them in almost a decade. I’m not married but I know when I’m dating somebody they all of a sudden care a lot and are interested. And no matter who I date or marry they will always act like he knows more even though I’m very smart and capable. I’m 37 and have an engineering degree with honors and was accepted at Georgetown on a scholarship for my MBA but they don’t really care. No matter who I marry if it’s a man then he will know more and be more worthy than me and my value will come from him in their eyes. I went to their beach house a few years ago with a key my grandmother gave me because she owns part of it and again they called the police on me. They’re trying to do everything they can to punish me into a relationship it’s gross and sick and controlling and cruel. Yet they want a relationship with me?? They want to hang out. But why??? They don’t care to know me or know who I am or how I feel or show me love or kindness or support. I don’t need anybody in my life who is abusive. They’re also very rich and use their money to control my younger sister. It’s really gross. They are deeply messed up unloving people and I just feel so sad I don’t have kind loving supportive parents who are proud of me and appreciate me. I want to get married and have my own family but I need for my parents to not be involved. I’ve also had to have a lot of therapy to teach myself I’m lovable and worthy of love despite my cruel parents, and that I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to as an adult Including having a relationship with people who are supposed to be loving and kind but are awful. My mom also does these terrible guilt trips where she says the doctor said that the fact that you don’t like me is causing all my heath problems. It’s gross. Love can’t be bought and I just need support knowing I can do this life and make all the money I need and have all the love and kindness and support I need and create my own loving family and life and I don’t need to include my parents if they can’t treat me with respect and be accountable. I just want to know I can find a loving husband (my parents don’t want me to have this without them) and create my own happy family and we can be financially secure and happy and not have ANYTHING to do with my parents and their abuse unless they decide they want apologize or treat me with respect and meet MY terms. I want to find safety and happiness. ",

I miss her so fucking much. and I don't understand why. at the end of our relationship I had lost 20 lbs, I was sick and so unhappy. every day I felt trapped and scared. but now I don't know how to be alone. it is definitely a trauma bond but my heart feels like it is literally breaking in my body each day. I hate being alone but no one feels as good as being around her. I am addicted to her. I would rather be with her screaming at me than away. I know how weak it sounds. we share a house together and I moved 2 hours away from the place I have called home for the past 4 years. I left behind my job my house all of my friends. our cat. I want it all back. I don't even think she gives a fuck about me at this point. she found another girl. I don't know how to keep going. I need to go no contact but I can't let go of the urge to beg for her back. what is wrong with me. for context, I am 24 she is 25 and it was my first real long term relationship. I have never felt anything like this and I truly don't know if I can continue. I want to go back so bad and just endure the abuse I don't even care. im in therapy got a new job and have friends and family where I moved but I am so fucking depressed. depressed doesn't even describe it. I don't feel like a real person without her.",

I did not respond, just ignored him. After a month, he kept spamming me via text messages, Whatsapp, emails, google photos apologizing and asking to be friends. I blocked him on all platforms I could think of. After that he reached out to my younger sister, she asked him not to text her. I then unblocked him and sent him a warning saying that I would report the harassment and take legal action. I thought he would stop engaging. But over the past few weeks I have been receiving connection requests on Linkedin from what appear to be fake accounts. I blocked and reported these profiles. I strongly suspect this is my ex, trying to keep tabs on me. But I do not believe my Ex will stop here. All of this is causing a lot of mental distress for me. The messages that he sent me were really toxic but they don't contain any threats regarding violence and he has never been physically violent. I still want to protect myself and stay as far as I can from this individual. What are my legal options here.",

I was terrified but somewhere expected it as he’s always so impulsive. My first instinct was to not let him stay but eventually felt bad and allowed it until his friends come to pick him up. The whole incident made me feel extremely uncomfortable, guilty and sad. \nI’m not sure anymore of what his intentions are. I can’t see him in the same light. It is possible that he truly came for what he said he came here for which is apologizing, but I did not found his apologies genuine, what I thought was that he might be here to either change the narrative that I did something wrong, which is not accepted him in the middle of the night when he showed up at my door and he had to resort to urgently calling his friends to pick him up and I am the bad person here narrative instead of me breaking up with him because I was tired of the disrespect from him and another reason, he was here to catch me in some kind of event or unethical relationship with someone else as when he came he also demanded to see my phone. \nI just don’t have a very positive feeling about why he actually came here to see me. He kept saying to apologize and he didn’t want to ruin and he felt it was his mistake. He’s going to change for real are all the things he said. Somewhere I did feel bad if there was some truth to what he was saying that he is full of guilt and sadness that flew across the country to apologize if he really feels so strongly about not losing me. I did feel very sad if this were true, but nevertheless , my mind was not ready to accept him back after all the realizations I’ve been having, it’s difficult to process all of this right now and I don’t really have all the courage to go through this, but I will try my best. \nI just hope nothing further happens about this, this matter dies down slowly, both of us are able to focus on ourselves. The whole incident really terrified me. I did not sleep most of the night in his presence, fearing what might happen when I close my eyes, he has never done anything like that to scare me to violence, but nevertheless, maybe I am too paranoid now. I just couldn’t shake the feeling off that something’s wrong with this person, and I am very sympathetic to his misery. \n\nHe’s rejected after flying across the country to get me back and I treated him the best way I could but couldnt accept him back and I couldn’t allow myself to have more conversation with him and get back with him. He wanted to know all the reasons for breakup, n tried and tried to give more in depth explanations about what were the main issues and whenever I tried speaking of them, he just couldn’t take it and wouldn’t want to hear more of it. I just don’t know what I could’ve done more and better, I feel sorry for him. \nI don’t wish this for him. I don’t wish this for anyone. I’ve been surprised at myself a lot for not becoming weak or giving up. I wouldn’t lie, there were times where it felt like I should just take him back not because I love him so much but because so that all of this could be over and things could go back to normal, but I didn’t, I’m very surprised at keeping together and having so many realizations. I’m being so kind to myself. I’m not saying that  I wouldn’t go into tears or breakdown or even worse situations because I have such grief before. I’ve had painful breakdowns and it’s surprising that this time I’m handling it better. I fear in the back of my mind that any time I could loose emotional control. \nBut I will keep fighting until then",

Yes there are plenty of hobbies and way to piss away money, that does not create an experience or happiness, it is a time killer. I am just waiting for death it seems, while the rest of the world and the one who promised over and over we would always have each other are living their best life. Any friends I had are married with kids and might have an hour a month to spare then retreat to their happy place, forget I exist and text me 6 months later.\n\nI never thought I would pray for rain and dusk, where I feel the most comfortable, in the darkness.",

Since a young age I would pray for a knight in shining armor who’ll rescue me each time I felt strong emotions as I couldn’t express to my parents or friends. I was miserable most of the time as long as I remember for the times I was single. I see that’s a lot because of self hatred and no self love. The only way to happiness I thought was through a partner. Being without one I thought is a curse or nightmare. Handling my emotions by myself was too much for me especially being so sensitive to the world that smallest words or actions bring me to tears and questioning my own worth. I see now that this was also because I didn’t create a support system with whom I can lean on or be my authentic self except for my partners. I focused on creating a false image of a perfect person and people pleased. As someone who was bullied as a child, had trouble making friends, put down by peers and parents this was the only way I thought I could make it in life - creating a false perfect picture. Didn’t realize all these things are so interdependent. Wish someone taught me what I needed to do to be a healthy happy person. But I’m glad it’s not too late now. This is the first time ever in my life, I’m going to try to enjoy my own company, celebrate who I’m authentically, give validation to myself, do things that are healthy for me - excercise, build support system, not people please, have strong boundaries, only allow someone in life when they enhance it.

        "Text": "It’s hard for me to wake up thinking about my ex pwNPD. I’m trying to move forward with my life. I’m dating again, someone I like a lot. I can’t control what happens in my brain, but I can control what I do. \n\nI’m a scientist by trade, and it’s natural for me to ask questions about everything. If I’m not finding the answer, I’ll keep asking questions until I figure it out. It’s served me well my whole life, and this is the first it’s hurting me. The stress I’m imposing on myself is aging me. So here’s my strategy.\n\nWhen I wake up thinking about my nex, I get out my diary and I write down my thoughts. For example:\n\nI miss waking up to her \n\nWhy hasn’t she called to apologize for how she treated me? \n\nI still want that baby and that family like we planned\n\nThose are my most frequent thoughts. I know that the answers to my questions will not be answered by her. I understand the disorder now, so I know that it’s not my fault I responded to liking someone by loving them and thought I’d get it back. I was in a low place. She picked up on it and capitalized on my depression. That’s what they do. \n\nI use my journal to answer my own questions, and then turn it into a statement. \n\n*I miss waking up to her*\n\nI’m lonely and hurting because of me, not her. Waking up to her is the beginning of the day serving her and putting her needs above your own. Your codependency is causing this feeling. \n\n*Why hasn’t she called to apologize for how she treated me?*\n\nShe may feel bad a tiny bit for how she treated you, but it will never be more important than her getting her supply and chasing whatever appeals to her in the moment. She will not change. She has not changed for the new supply. She doesn’t need to apologize because to her she isn’t wrong. She’s been hurting people and abandoning them her whole life. \n\nShe will not call and apologize because you are not important to her. \n\n*I still want that baby and that family that we planned*\n\nNarcissists make terrible parents. They aren’t capable of love, and that does include their own children. Look at how she treats her own family. Look at how she treated you. Would you want that as the mother of your child? You can have a family with someone else. It will be better because you’ll have it with someone who can love you and your baby. \n\nIt’s not a perfect remedy, but talking things out with yourself is important. At some point in your research, the answers and closure is already within you. Try to help yourself avoid self harm by providing logical answers to your own questions.\n\nYour narc will never give you closure. You have to find it within. ",

So he pushes me away as he thinks that he can't change.\n\nI have few knowledge about Narcopaths so I want to know more about them. Are they really incapable of change?\n\nHoping for kind responses.

        "Text": "My narc was very shy and timid. Surface level nice bc he wanted to be liked. Never got close with people unless they were romantically involved with him. He was benevolent..to an extent. He was pretty romantic. He was in therapy ffs. He liked my mom and she found him to be very sweet. He would never tell her when he would be abusive towards me but would tell her things I did. He wouldn’t talk to his own mother about us tho. He even wanted to do therapy together but stopped after two sessions bc he didn’t wanna be too honest about what he’s been doing to me in our relationship to his therapist. He wrote me love letters, he would dance and sing with me…when he got drunk he was really emotional and would say he loved me a lot .\n\nBut he had control issues. Once grabbed my hands nd dragged me down the street like you would a little kid in the store. Has thrown me, pushed me shoved me, never hit. We would argue in circles. He lacked empathy and admitted that to me. He was very insecure. Very clingy and admitted to an u healthy obsession with me. We were together for a month before he said we should get a place together, and that living apart wouldn’t be good for us. I had to ask him permission for friends to come over. He would say I put my friends over him. He would say he’d take me out on dates more, then when it’s time for the date, ignore me the whole time or be quiet, or say “let’s just stay home”. He’d break up with me if I didn’t unfollow someone he didn’t like, if my emotions weren’t regulated, if I didn’t communicate with him how he wanted. Then he’d love bomb me, do things for me when it wasn’t expected or after he’d leave me, and say WE need to work on things. He would demean me, make me feel unsafe then record my reactions. He got a restraining order on me, after I kept quiet about my abuse. \n\nBut to everyone, he’s kind and quiet and could never. It’s like no one believes me. Even today I was venting to my mom, who at first was supportive, changed her mind and said he’s not a narcissist bc when they spoke to each other it sounded like he had empathy. Which hurt me soooo bad bc when they talked he never was forthright about what he was doing to me. Just “I think she’s moving on to someone else” “we’re having problems but I still love her” but never said what he did. He would go back to his exes or old girls when we would argue. My mom was the first one I called when he punched holes in the wall. So for her to try and see the good in him pained me. My mom is also a DV survivor too though, and literally got out of her third abusive relationship and even today still defends her abuser saying she’d give him a chance again if he apologizes right and goes to therapy. She said she doesn’t think her abuser is a narcissist and neither is mine. They’re just hurt people. The friends he told about our relationship think I beat him up. He said in court i would attack him for no reason… \n\nI’ve been spiraling ever since the discard. This discard being harder than others bc the law is involved. I protected him, faked in front of his family, thought about his image and he used me defending myself and reaching my breaking point to say I abused him? To the point where I believed it for a bit…..bc I knew ppl wouldn’t believe me. He’s just “too nice”.\n\nI hate this. I almost wish he beat me badly to prove it. Bc unless I have a black eye or I’m nearly dead it seems like it doesn’t matter. \n\nI haven’t eaten normally in months. I cry everyday listening to podcasts and reading peoples posts. I’m sensitive to everything now… I waste away in my bed and sleep past noon. While he moves on with his life, brings people into the home we shared and keeps his job and reputation in tact. I wish he would get his karma. I wish I could get my justice. I’ve never felt so low. ",

It ended up being just under 6,000 miles away from home, to a new country that I had never even visited, with a language that I didn't (but now do!) (kind of!) speak. \n\nI really thought I was going insane with this whole experience. Sometimes I still do. \n\nLately, mostly for the past 6 months actually, things have been surprisingly difficult, just as I thought things were really improving. For reasons that I cannot understand the Christmas hoover (via flying monkey) was much more intense than the one I got the Christmas before and though we are now two years out, the smear campaign seems to be intensifying day by day. I suspect this is because I am due to visit home within the next few months. I am still figuring out what to do if I have a run-in. \n\nStill, I've been really strong. I have *almost* two years of no contact coming up. I have never, ever stalked his social media pages. Not once!\n\nYet I could still hear his voice in my head constantly putting me down this whole dang time. \n\n18 months of yoga and with every pose all I felt was anger and hurt. I would constantly belittle myself for not being able to let go -- of my mind, of my body, of my nex. I'd see people in class moving perfectly or letting go emotionally and I could never get to that place. All those classes and I felt like nothing was happening and it was all useless. No progress with the poses and no progress emotionally.\n\nI was so wound up that I could hardly cry even when I was alone. *\"What are you crying for? You don't deserve to cry.\"* I spent yesterday so angry that I just felt like I had regressed entirely. On top of that, there was yet another hoover by proxy that just got to me when I was feeling low. \n\nThen, today. \n\nWent in, set up my mat. Anger and pain as usual. The class was going along, just as normal, then I went into a backbend and my first thought, my *immediate*, *instant* thought about myself was \"*I'm so beautiful\"*. And all the tears just came out. Never in my life have I ever thought or felt that way about myself. Sure, I could say an affirmation but it was never something I actually believed. \n\nBut there, all on its own, it just... came to me! Real and true!\n\nProgress!\n\nI can't help but think that one little day made all the difference. Just one tiny day that I had been waiting for this whole time. The moment was perfect and as it was meant to be -- not early on the anniversary itself but today. ",

I felt free. I recently quit drinking alcohol (the drinking was getting out of hand. It was causing me to feel like crap too often,mentally and physically and I got sick of it) but the last couple of months I've felt so down in the dumps. I do not find joy in many things anymore. I do not want to be around anyone including my friends and parents. I don't want to go to work. I lay around and rot on my couch and just doom scroll on the internet. How can I get myself out of this? I have a therapist that I see on and off when needed but she recently raised her prices and I just cannot afford it at the moment. I adopted a senior dog that keeps me company and I love with all my heart. When I DO decide to go out with friends, I just don't have much fun and all I can think about is going home. Any advice on how to find joy in life again would be appreciated. ",

I never found a genuine person to be around because whomever I trusted turned  out to be the same and drain me of my kindness or tried to control my life since they failed in life. It's laughable how pafetic toxic people are and I do not have to show grace to them and go my way, the mistreatment was the message.\n***\nNow after much reconsideration I realised there are more toxic people and narcs than genuine people in this world  because the messed up way I was treated I would never do to others.

Cannot create, cannot take accountability, misusing, dumping and discarding. I feel 0 sympathy for people like this because the only time they realise is when their actioms come back to bite them. \n\n***\nIt's crazy the things you realised when you are far away from narcs and these types, the way they play on your emotions, the lies and contradictions and wasting time, the putting your past and insecurities in your face.

Your relationships rely on unhealthy transactions of jealousy, resentment, envy, and covet. \n\nI thought about the time we stayed at your cousins house and Yolanda gave us a lift after you got drunk.

I pulled you by the waist to get you to walk away but you wanted to stay on the grass, dancing as you flipped her the bird. \n\nTwo birds with either hand. I looked at her.

They were NEVER there for me when I asked, MOST of the time after they raged for days and weeks about how I'm worthless to them, that's when Id need them the most and Id just beg and apologize that I WOULD CHANGE to make it stop. All I would want is them to acknowledge and apologize. To act like they know what they've done.\n\nI have all the information I need. I've known for over 7 years what this is. Its been a month since they left and the reason they left shows me everything I knew to be true, IS true. I have no support system, I'm all alone everyday, I'm really fucking scared. I know they deserve nothing from me but anger, I will never forgive them, but I just want them near me while I'm drowning in misery.\n\nI never had a voice, I was never heard, I could never get anything authentic like a true apology. So many years gone by and I STILL cant make myself be happy they are gone. I was miserable with them, so lonely and isolated with nobody to talk to about it because the behavior was so outrageous noone would understand. But every other day was good. I remember feeling so empowered, knowing I can do better, I will be better, everything in my life will bloom without them. But I cant stand the thought of them being happy while I'm in eternal suffering, I didn't think it would be this lonely...its eternal invalidation. I gaslight myself that it could work even though they wont put in a shred of effort.\n\nI'm telling you there were SO MANY things that happened over the years. Every month there was a 2 week long argument or silent treatment. They threw things at me, threw drinks on me and used their favorite phrase \"You are a piece of shit\" every other day. I could never talk about the behavior or how it stresses me out and puts me behind in everything else in life because my mind and body is constantly in fight or flight mode. They never understood our life together is not what they want because I don't have the energy to provide you with the things you desire, my life is consumed with trying to save this marriage and how to stop them from acting irrationally and using me to take their hate out on. OF course I cant give you a new kitchen or vacation, you remove your income from the household every other month for a few months, I have to budget our entire family on the income I can count on...mine.\n\nIts just so lonely, this place is haunted with memories of them, every corner of every room is a reminder of pain, misery or sex.\n\nI JUST WANT TO NOT WANT THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE THE WORST HUMAN i HAVE EVER MET AND TREATED ME WORST THAN ANY SCHOOLYARD BULLY.\n\nWhy is that SO HARD? so much has happened I don't even have memories of it. Like I only have the terrible memories of last year not the year before and its like that for every year that passes. I remember the misery and the frequency but I would dismiss the transgressions in order move past. My mind has also blacked stuff out, that's how I know its real trauma. This person was textbook, I mean they were every post on here and then some, we know they're all the same but they left zero space for doubt, it was just mind bending. I think that's why I cant accept or comprehend what I know because its so unbelievable, its so insane it cant be real, they just need help, they HAVE to love me, you cant be with someone that long, marry them, raise children together....but everytime I needed a slice of love or tenderness or kindness or RESPECT OR ACCOUNTABILITY I could not get anything, anything at all. Instead I'm told that I treat them like shit and tell them they are worthless. Everything that happened to me I was told was my fault and the treatment I received was my fault because \"you made me this way, you make me do this to you\".\n\nI logically understand how thats impossible but I swear if I just ignored it eventually it would stop. Instead it ramped up. There was nothing I could do, there was nothing I could have ever shown, the only thing that ever worked is having no self respect or boundaries and then things would be peaceful. I hate this, I cant make this go away when all I want is to be happy I don't have to deal with it anymore. I'm jealous they get to move on and be out on a sunny day enjoying life while I deal with all the responsibilities they left on me by promptly discarding me and then all the emotional torture I have to ignore in order to get things done. I really feel like I want to die.",

        "Text": "It’s been about 2 months since I’ve finally gotten out of my abusive relationship with a narcissist(pretty sure he is one). I’ve been doing great honestly and have been dating around. It’s been fun, but I’ve decided to take a break to focus fully on nursing school and myself! I don’t know if it’s because I’m not distracting myself with dates anymore but I’ve been feeling the urge to out my abuser for the 8 years of trauma I’ve been through. He started dating someone else 2 weeks after blowing my phone up No Caller ID and asking me to come over.. this was about a month and a half ago. I was seeing someone else at the time so I declined is offer and told him to seek help and stop calling me. He got extremely upset and started cussing me out and saying the nastiest things about me. I was a little triggered to find out that he had moved on so fast. Yes, I was dating too, but nothing serious! He was already posting this new girl and it made me sick to my stomach to think that he could jump into a new relationship so soon after ending our 8 year relationship. I can’t even imagine being in a relationship right now-I have suffered so much trauma, I want to give myself time to heal, meet new people, and spend some time being single. Anyways, I don’t know…despite being in therapy, surrounding myself with loving friends and family, meeting new people, focusing on my future, going to the gym, etc..I still suffer from panic attacks, nightmares, sadness, and anger- SO MUCH ANGER sometimes. I’m angry that he got to move on to the next girl like nothing, no healing, no taking accountability, no therapy..and I’ve literally had to do everything in my power to get to where I am today. I’m angry that the girl is a mutual of mine and knows of his physical/emotional/verbal abuse and still decided to be with him. I’m angry that everyone around him thinks he’s such a great person. I just want justice. I want the truth out. I wish I had done things differently but I was so young and didn’t know better. I feel like outing him could bring me some sort of feeling of justice and also help people who are stuck in abusive relationships wake up and find the courage to leave unlike me who stuck around for 8 years. I know I know, the best revenge is that he has to live with who he is as a person and that he’ll get his karma one day blah blah blah, but sometimes bad people continue to thrive and idk that’s just not enough for me right now.\n\nSorry for this long paragraph, I just needed to dump everything out. I would appreciate any advice, thoughts, questions, etc. ",

I dont know if i will ever move on. what if my future is her? i ended it but now i am questioning everything. she says i am the one who abused and traumatized her. my friends who saw it all happen from the beginning tell me she’s manipulating me but i am so confused and hurt.

My narc came back and I said bye fool kiss my ass.” Admittedly I have longed for the same fleeting validation that my nex is a hot raggedy needy confused mess. \n\nNot all narcs Hoover, and I’m pretty sure mine won’t. That’s okay. Narcs need people who are lacking in boundaries. Narcs need easy supply because they are inherently lazy. Narcs need a doormat they can trample on. They need someone they can recycle easily. Someone who will be waiting for them like a 1940s housewife when their sailor comes back from sea having put their submarine in every port along the way home. \n\nIf your narc hasn’t hoovered, it’s because you have exposed their game. You know too much. You have too many boundaries. You’re not willing to be their maid, their slave, their personal assistant, their shoe shiner, or their ass kisser. You have wised up. You are too strong. Maybe you’re even a narc slayer. \n\nInstead of the low vibration of resentment or angst that your narc hasn’t hoovered, take it as a badge of honor. You have transformed yourself into a confident person that is no longer attractive to a narc. You don’t believe their lies and their trauma dumps don’t work on you. Think of yourself as someone who caused the narcissist too much of an injury because they could no longer control you. \n\nA narc that doesn’t hoover is a blessing. A compliment. An accomplishment.\n\nI am no longer hurting. I am no longer suffering. I am no longer a doormat. \n\nLike ‘02 Britney Spears, \n\nI’m stronger. \n\nBye narc! ",

Like I chose to date him, I only stayed in hopes if I died i was forgiven for my sins (hurting loved ones, if there's a term for that plzzzzz lmk) but yeah. Some nights I cry I'm having trouble adjusting to society again. People's kindness feels fake, men I don't know make me uncomfortable, certain topics at college overwhelm me. Overall, I feel weak and like I shouldn't have survived. Like I want to find a nice man to marry but somedays I feel ill never find that or I'm not deserving since I chose to date him. I was in a pretty healthy relationship before him but I more so left that one cuz my narcissistic ex was forcing himself on me all the time. \n\nThe other guy and I had a situation which made me trust him a bit less and I was too scared to tell him in fear he wouldn't believe me. People would see my narcissistic ex hold my hand and assume I was cheating but truly I was so emotionally dead from my life (my dog died in front of me, parental divorce, and I was severely in need of mental health medication and therapy cuz I suffered delusions and disabling depression). Anyways yeah he starts giving me gifts, kissing me, and holding my hand and I have no time to react and people start seeing me as a whore or a cheater or whatever but truly like I mentioned I mentally shut down with everything going on cuz I was like 17. Anyways I leave cuz he threatens to kill the guy I was with, I loved that man too much to let him get hurt. In my mind I was like if he kills me it's me showing how much love and dedication I have towards this person (working on that in therapy) so I stayed as a punishment because he flipped a whole 180 a year in. He went from being loving and affectionate to like, constantly berating me for no reason. I gained a lot of weight from anti depressants that saved my life. And he would convince me that no one could ever love a fat girl and I believe it at the time. He drilled in my head that because I wasn't a slim thick girl I wasn't human. I believed the highs of him giving affection were worth it cuz who would love me. But then he started taking those forced affections into having sex with me while I was sleeping or without even asking. \n\nThe amount of trauma and guilt for that because I should've said something but I was so numb, and I believed I had to die to be forgiven by the good relationship guy for hurting him by leaving and not telling my narcissistic ex to fuck off. Anyways, I'm alive ! He was tryna rape me to death tbh if that's even possible. I'm terrified of what tomorrow brings most days, I fear I could never be loved, I fear I'm a whore,  I feel dirty.  But I'm holding onto hope that I'm alive for a reason and also getting into Spirituality helped me do a lot of soul work.\n\n But yeah, any tips on how to move forward would be great cuz the wounds are still fresh. I want to take my life back and go to the gym but that's his favorite place, he's a massive jock with a God complex. But yeah any support would help I feel so at fault cuz I choose him even tho realistically I had no choice. I feel like I'm being punished for my mistakes and it's so hard ",

You miss the feeling they gave you. \n\nFeelings are fleeting. There is no such thing as eternal desire. That’s like saying “honest narcissist.” You just won’t find it because the nature of desire is for it to go up and come down. Basic Newtonian law. \n\nConsider this. Your brain has been made aware your narc is an abuser. You have been made aware of lying, cheating, dishonesty. \n\nWhat you may not know yet depending on where you are in your healing journey is that all narcissists are impulse driven. They cannot cultivate anything. They cannot sustain anything. Even if they get married, they will still behave as a narcissist. They may slurp up your supply slowly and be so clever you don’t notice their wandering eye. \n\nThere is no such thing as a healthy or successful relationship with a narc. \n\nDon’t be upset about the new supply. Narcs don’t change. They are being treated the exact same way. You may see them on vacation. You may see them get engaged or get married. The treatment you got from that narc will still be there. It will always be inside of them even as they mask it. You know what is underneath. As soon as that selfie is snapped they will be argumentative. Volatile. Mad for no reason. Blame shifting. Everything you went through will endure. That new supply is already walking on eggshells. They are already confused and writing off bad behavior because they’ve been love bombed.\n\nNothing has changed. \n\nYou can trust the disorder. You cannot trust social media. You definitely cannot trust your narc. \n\nIn the words of Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. It is the acts and the state of mind which determines identity and the character of (wo)man. A persons sustained acts and deeds overall are who that person is.  Judge them by their deeds. Not by your emotions. \n\nYour narc has a personality disorder which causes them to lack empathy and not be able to love you. It does not change. It does not improve. It is never ameliorated only exacerbated with time. \n\nWhat is there to want for ? What is there to be jealous of?\n\nThe same thing that is inside your narc. \n \nNothing. ",

I had complete control of my mind when I meditated regularly. It's such a pleasant experience. I fell in love with it and still continue to do that occasionally as I have a busy schedule now. I started a business parallel to my job as I wanted to keep myself busy and it flourished. I love my job and the people I meet everyday and also I love my customers. They really helped me get back and gave me a lot of respect that I feel I lost when I was in relationship with a narcissist. \n\nStill I had a grudge inside that hurted me a lot that why didn't she hoover as I really felt undeserving and unworthy because of it. But now I leave that too. I just hope wherever she is a day comes when she sees the pain she gives the people she love. I am saying this as I told somedays back that she disappeared from social media as well. As I came to know about this after the guy whom she cheated me with called me. \n\nI am leaving everything with just a little hope that the almighty God is watching everything and he will see how that girl gets her karma and now I am free from the bondage. I just want not just this narcissist but all narcissists to experience once the pain they give others. Who will tell them that they will get endless supply but they don't need to manipulate or gaslight someone to get it. Instead love people. People just want love. My nex wanted money and I was ready to shower her with that but cheating is not forgivable as it's a choice not a mistake.\n\nI spread the love here for everyone hope you all reach a stage of indifference soon and you get peace soon as many of you are really hurt and I know how hard it feels to be separate from the one we are trauma bonded.

        "Text": "Hi, so I think I have worked out that my husband of 22 years is a covert narcissist with hypochondria traits and martyr tendencies. I am so confused as to what to do.\n\nI don’t know if he has, but I know I darent mention it to him, he will blow his lid then ignore me for days. It has always been a very strange relationship, in that he can be absolutely brilliant, funny, kind but the crap out weighs the good at times. He seems to know how far to push me before he reels me back in. \n\nI walk on eggshells regularly\nHe ignores me for days with no reason\nEverything is on his terms\nI feel neglected emotionally\nI question why I am even speaking as I know he won’t listen to me\nThere is no one as ill as him, or tired as him, or works as hard as him\nHe is very suspicious of me and is convinced I’ve cheated (which I haven’t) \n\nI am tired and extremely flat in my mood - when I’m at work or with friends I feel ok, but when I walk back on the house I feel deflated. \n\nIs it him? Is it me? I think my mum has narcissistic traits, but it can’t be everyone else all the time!!! Is it me?? Help! \n\nThank you",

I don’t understand why this happens and why I can’t just run and keep running. I feel so absolutely miserable and depressed this weekend.

In short, I feel for a married man who didn't tell me he was married for the first full year of our relationship and spent the second one telling me he'd leave his wife for me. We even did couple therapy together.\n\nHe just flew me to NYC for two weeks, where he resides with her, for what he deemed a \"domestic trial\"... and then proceeded to not spend a single night with me, except for the one night his wife found out I was in town and kicked him out! He went back to her the next day. Then, as soon as he learned I had met someone else, he told me he wanted to try again... had me take the other guy from the apartment, and then ghosted me. He didn't show up. He was supposed to spend the night and take me to a concert the next day. But no, he spent the night at home, with his wife, who he took to that concert in the end.\n\nThe very next day, he shows up like nothing happened, wanting to go for a bike ride. Apparently, his wife has agreed that he can see me provided he discloses when and where. So now that she's on board, he can see me more often, he says. **He wanted to come up and sleep with me.** This entire time, this entire trip, this was all premised on a future he promised we'd have together. A future he says he still wants, but away from NYC where she is. But no, he works and resides here... he's never moving. So if we cannot be here together, it's obvious we can't be together anywhere.\n\nI've asked him all the questions, why, etc. He says he wants one of us to decide instead of him. This is not true. His wife decided to throw him out, and he went back in again immediately. I \"decided\" when I started meeting others (both now and in the past) and he always made a point of reeling me back in with false promises. When faced with this, he said -- *I suppose you're right. I'm the one who hasn't made up my mind.*\n\nHe wants me as his plaything in other cities, I know. He wants me when he's away from home, but when worlds collide he can't handle it, I know. So if I know, why can't I move on? **I know I need to leave and move on.** I've tried to meet others but nothing works. I feel like a shell of the woman I used to be: beautiful, smart, witty, fun. It feels like it will never end. Most nights, I go to bed hoping I'll sleep forever.\n\nI'm 32. I feel old and drained and defeated. I don't know how to continue on.",

Then my narc ex guilted me with suicide. \n\nThen all of his shitty enabling flying monkeys gaslit me and treated me like total shit. Bizarre, because I’m the victim of rape and deceit here. \n\nPretty sure they can all be legally culpable for this since they allowed him to catfish me using fake videos, and knew about it but didn’t say anything, and actively gaslit me collectively to hide the issue? Anyway, just a thought: **sounds a bit like victim blaming to me.**\n\nOh, and he also sent me rape, stalk, and death threats. Curious! \n\nMost interestingly: he contacted and catfished me with fake video chats—pretending to be supportive and relatable—after I made a thread *about him raping me*, but he was actually **getting off to my pain because he was the one who had raped me.**\n\n**What a vile, despicable person, right?** I don’t see redemption or worth in his future without **severe** guidance, yet they all seem to do a lot of enabling and treating me like shit. Sounds like calling the cops is the right call for someone so sick. \n\nOf course I still love him—in a way—and am trauma bonded to him, but that doesn’t mean I deserve this treatment. Just because I act emotional towards him and want him to get help whenever I find out how sick he really is doesn’t mean I deserve any of this, or am pathetic for having an emotional attachment to my abuser. \n\nThey are saying I should get off Reddit and deactivate all my social media so that he doesn’t stalk me. **Isn’t that blaming the victim?

If he stalks me and ESPECIALLY if he catfishes me, that is a legal issue for HIM which is not my responsibility.**\n\nOf course, I’ll try to be safe from now on, but it’s not MY FAULT he raped, stalked, and deceived me.

        "Text": "Have you ever looked in the mirror and said to yourself “what does the new supply have that I don’t?” Or “why was I discarded?” \n\nIt’s natural to ask why. It’s human nature to be a comparison junkie, especially if you’re codependent like many narc abuse victims are. \n\nI asked “why did this happen to me?” For a while. And after I got done crying, I turned on my science brain and I went to work. \n\nMy ex pwNPD thought she had a downgrade from her previous victim. I very much was a downgrade at the time we met. I wasn’t beautiful on the inside. I was reeling from suppressed emotions. I was on a one year sabbatical in Spain, and I was on a healing journey. I wasn’t regulating my emotions well, and I was trying to overcome depression. I was suffering and lost when we met, and that’s why we were drawn to each other. \n\nNo narcissist wants to discard you. They discard you because they have to. Why? Any individuating steps you take after lovebombing ends is an injury to them. Narcs are aware of this but they don’t do these things intentionally. The erratic, hot and cold pattern they display is because their mask is slipping. Whether you take the dual mothership paradigm or the individuation separation point of view, the essence is the same. You are breaking down their fantasy any time you push back. Any time you say no. It’s like kryptonite for a narc because their delusions are what shield their fragile childlike state. \n\nOnce you start telling them no you’re wearing them down. Every time you question what they do, you’re injuring them. Any time you display consistency in happiness and positivity after devaluation occurs, it’s like nails on a chalkboard for them. Why? They need to be the greatest in their world. Your happiness is a reminder that they are tormented inside. Your sweet, loving nature is a reminder of their fraudulent mask they had to use to mimic that. \n\nThey think you’re supposed to be a liar because they are. When you show them honesty and integrity, they want to show themselves you don’t have any. They want you to be crappy like them. They want to be good like you. \n\nIf you saw them after their mask slipped, you’d run for the hills, correct? Most people would, which is an excellent segue on narcs whose new supply is their ex. \n\nThe ex has seen the mask slip. The ex knows the real them. If they went back, it’s because the are vibrating at the same low frequency. Liars hang with liars. Cheaters hang with cheaters. Heaux hang with heaux. Sweet, good natured people want to be around the same. \n\nYou drove your narc crazy by being happy. By being good. They are the best in the world. They are the God of their fabricated universe. So they had to teach you a lesson. They had to break you down and put you in that low place. They left you with no closure so you could come back to them. Crying, begging, hoping you’d talk to them over a glass of Minute Maid. The messy painful discard is designed to make you feel low. To make you feel less than. They have to prove to you that they are better than you so they can be souped up with energy for the new supply. The energy that will be used to triangulate them. That’s your energy they’ve stolen, and now you feel like death on two legs. \n\nNotice how happy they are once they’ve stolen your positivity. Once they’ve destroyed your smile, all of a sudden they have your smile on their face. \n\n They monkey branched with a new supply that is easier to manipulate than you. They have means tested this person while with you, and they know they are in a no boundary low integrity scenario. That’s a narcs playground. \n\nI had a special surprise for my ex pwNPD. Yes, when I was the new supply, I was on her level spiritually. I was broken. Hurting. Low. That energy was on me but not in me. I began to heal. I bossed up. I leveled up. \n\nThat’s why after I got discarded, I never asked HER why. I hit the books. Much to her chagrin every single thing she said or did is straight out of the covert narcissist textbooks. Books that were written before she was even born have her all spelled out. \n\nThat educated empath hits different, don’t she? 😂\n\nThe devaluation is an illusion. It is a retaliation to the realization that the narcissist is a lesser version than their victim. They use what they’ve learned during mirroring to make you tick. By the discard, they have fully convinced you that they are the prize. They know they are not qualified to even deal with someone so beautiful. So they have to convince you otherwise. That makes them feel good. That makes them feel powerful. \n\nPlease understand. The narcissist only has the energy you give them. They do not regulate themselves. They cannot derive any value internally. \n\nThe narcissist derives its power from you.\n\nTake the power away by giving them neither good nor bad energy, and they die. \n\nOr replace you with someone easier to manipulate. \n\nThe alternative for them is literally spiritual starvation.

Not punching him, attacking him, just reaching for the keys out of his pocket. He pinned me up against the side of his truck afterwards. I was confused about what was happening after I said attacked realizing how guilt-tripped and scared of retaliation I was to say what he did, the cop wouldn't let me explain myself saying \"you're not listening!\" \"you're interrupting!\" after I WAS LISTENING responding to everything she said after she interrupted over and over again. I called her out said she should get a hand mirror to see her projection (a bit unhinged at this point) she says \"why, cause I'm pretty? Thank you!\"\n\nReported my cousin for exposing herself to me when I was 17 and she as 30, cop showed up and said \"but only saw her boob once, right?\" multiple times downplaying what I went through. FUCK. YOU. They have destroyed my trust in authority and somehow made me feel even less safe than I did before after growing up in a narcissistic cult.

He asked if I wanted my tv, I said he could have it. Because I’m afraid of being sucked back in into the rollercoaster if I see him. He didn’t like that much but apologized for the way he treated me. But then also proceeded to get into a rage. He told me I “disappeared “ which I’m not sure what he expects when he kicked me out, he then complained how I know where he is but he doesn’t know where I am, I told him if he just asked where I was I would tell him even though not sure why he feels entitled to know that information when he kicked me out. He then said there’s no way that I’m not at least entertaining another man right now, (I’m in no way ready to talk to men and I’m not interested in even chatting with a man right now) he then started talking about my friends & how they couldn’t even keep a man & have gotten into my head (only ppl I have spoke to about this is you guys and my sister) he started saying he’s serious now (I guess he wasn’t serious when he kicked me out?) that I’m ungrateful for all I received and this is the thanks he gets. He deserves better. I took him for granted. That I must think other guys will have hearts like his. That I will always be like my parents and that won’t be good enough for him. That you can’t make a woman from the streets a housewife. He shamed me for not asking about his daughter and how I couldn’t even have a conversation with his mom after he kicked me out. He told me to find my husband or bounce from guy to guy. He said I was setting him aside. And how it’s been a week and he was the one who had to reach out like always while also saying he loves me & how the way we used to be was amazing. Then that same night texted me saying “you betrayed me stay over there”, I texted back and said i have no clue what you are speaking of. Also he never asked where I was, I’m thinking it’s only because he wants that power over me to tell him with out him asking. So that was the last thing & I haven’t heard from him since.

I haven’t seen this mentioned so often here so I’m sharing it, hoping I’m not alone in this.\n\n Specifically, my ex often accused me of staring at other men, seeking their attention sexually and I started adamantly denying that I ever looked at someone, even if it happened innocently (like passing someone on the street or in the grocery store) because there was nothing innocent or coincidental about that according to him. The mental gymnastics and semantics I felt I had to undergo was tough so the only way I knew how to deal with it was to deny, deny, deny. He abused me over it and I know that he acted horribly but I also acted like a person I’m not proud of. He found out once in an argument and all hell broke loose. \n\nAnother major issue was that I was financing our lives and we started struggling - mostly because his consumption was so unpredictable. While I did try to ask that we sit down and make a budget and express some concern, I didn’t share it with him explicitly, and he realised it as I couldn’t hide it anymore and he snapped. I felt extremely alone and responsible for us and I feared his reaction - that’s why I didn’t tell him.\n\nI know lying is wrong and I guess I generally am a quite honest person. I don’t really know, as I’m painted as the one who hurt and deceived him and some who was power tripping and lording money over his head. It’s like every positive thing I ever tried to do has been twisted into something horrible. Even though I can argue that I did it to protect myself, I’m still struggling to accept that I’m a liar, and to reconcile this fact with who I think I am. It eats me up.

It’s hard to know that as harsh as life has been to you, it’s about to be a whole lot harsher. \n\nMaybe you think moving into that house will bring you closer. Maybe you think getting married will finally settle Squidward down. I used to think that for some strange reason even though I was married to a lesser narcissist who in the end wasn’t able to assume the responsibility of being married. \n\nSquidward will only get worse with time. I used to be hung up on the idea of you getting your karma. I’ve since let that go. I wouldnt even wish being with Squidward on an adversary. The mental anguish I know you have experienced, but you did it for so many years. And you’re doing it again right now. It’s starting now, I can feel it. It looks pretty in the picture but you’re already doing math. Things aren’t adding up. So you’re looking backwards at that lovebomb you just got. \n\nIt can’t be maintained. Healthy relationships bore Squidward. If you aren’t fighting, she will pick that fight. It may be fun to fight and make up at first. The problem is you will be the only one that truly cares. Her ability to understand is stunted. \n\nHer fauxpology took 3 years to muster. \n\nGuggenbühl-Craig called the dark triad Cluster B's \"empty souls.\"\n\nThey’ve been called that for at least two generations. \n\nThe covert narcissist is a cold, dark, dead person. \n\nI used to be envious. \n\nNow I’m grateful that you freed me \n\nAnd I hope you don’t die hoping for improvements that will never come. \n\nIn the myth of Narcissus, he was a Greek God who loved nobody until he saw himself in the mirror. He loved his reflection so much he would not move. \n\nEcho, a beautiful girl, saw Narcissus and fell in love with him. But he was too busy loving himself to notice her. \n\nHe stared at the image of himself until he died, and Echo cared for him until he died looking at himself. Loving only himself. \n\nI’m watching a real live version of it from a distance \n\nAnd I feel bad to know you’re pouring into a cup with a hole in it. \n\nEnjoy the optics and smiling for the camera. \n\nI know from experience that when the party is over, you’ll be drained. Bereft. Empty. Lacking intimacy. Lacking fulfillment. Waiting for a lovebombing that will only be momentary before receding into the baseline of selfishness.\n\nI feel bad\n\nBut not bad enough to warn you. \n\n",

Educating myself has helped because I realize how it was right out of the playbook, and understanding the playbook has helped put a lot of the relationship-long hurt into context. But man, no matter how much knowledge the thinking part of my mind accumulates, both about her and about my role in partnering with someone like her, my body and soul still feel so beaten...and lonely.\n\nMaybe a sign of a bit of healing though, but I'm not sure: I'd do it all again, both the relationship and choosing the path of truth. I have 2 friggin amazing children that I would have otherwise never had. And an incident with one of them where I called it like I saw it was that moment I referred to. I'm out, its over. Currently broke due to lawyers fees, but I'd spend all that money again because it got me the time with them that I do have, and we get to have time together that isn't tainted by the old way.",

It’s been a year of back and forth and absolute nastiness. I was able to recently get a PFA (protection from abuse order) against him so he can’t talk to me unless it involves the children. I am a case manager and trauma coach and have spent the last year healing myself, going to therapy and getting my life in order. About a month after we sold our house and he bought a new one, he basically had a live in girlfriend who has two kids of her own. I have never met her as he won’t let me but I know she’s incredibly kind and sweet to my two kids, my daughter tells me all the time. My issue is not with the new girlfriend, quite frankly I’m happy that she is helpful and she sounds sweet. What bothers me is that it’s really making me doubt myself. I know that it was bad and by the time I left I was a shell of myself. I don’t understand how he treated me so poorly and then just dived in on essentially becoming a step father to her two kids while he still emotionally and verbally abused me for months! I’m having a hard time not thinking that it was all me and maybe that’s why he treated me that way. I would never wish that another woman would experience what I did, which is why I end up defending her sometimes when he tries to essentially say she doesn’t matter to me while also saying her kids call him dad! I think I need some guidance from others on how to cope because I fear it will affect my moving on. ",

        "Text": "Dear Little Marilyn,\n\nIt’s been a rough 3 and a half months since you moved out. I’m proud of you for sticking it out. You had some slip ups but you handled yourself well. You blocked someone that you want to talk to every day, and I know how hard that is. \n\n I’m sorry I stepped aside when everything was telling me this is too good to be true and to slow down. I thought to myself maybe trying to go house shopping within three months wasn’t a bad idea. Please understand I was rooting for you. I was rooting for us. I wanted to believe in fairy tales just like you did. I learned that they don’t exist, and we both had to suffer for that. But it’s my job to protect you, little Marilyn. I didn’t do that, and I’m sorry. \n\nI stepped aside for the past two years. I went into hibernation. We’ve experienced a lot of changes. Cadiz. La Palma. Tenerife. Iowa. Illinois. Michigan. I got thrown for a loop in all this frenzy. But I’m stronger now. Your narcissistic ex hits like a bitch. I had a little nosebleed and a tiny scratch. That ain’t shit. I’m back and I’m better. Let me put you up on game and tell you how I’m going to do better. \n\nSee, I let you pour all this love into someone else. You should have loved yourself that way. You bound yourself to a master manipulator who did nothing but absorb you and reflect yourself back to you. You loved it! Remember how unique and special you thought she was? She ain’t shit. Bitch that’s you! You are that bitch that you adored! \n\nYou are to be loved and cherished and I’m going to show you. You cooked that raggedy ass poser food she never ate before. You took some boring lame west side bust down to places she didn’t even know existed before you. You put your heart and soul into her pleasure. You denied yourself so she could have. She knows there is nobody she would do that for. What about you? I neglected you. I should have given that love to you. I’m sorry, but in the future I’ll do better. You have to do better, too. \n\nStop worrying about the activities of a heaux and a prostitute. They don’t understand us because their world sucks. It’s full of liars, cheaters, dishonest people who think nothing of hurting others. When you showed up with no baggage, no pain to project onto your ex pwNPD, no turmoil, no chaos: just calm, love, happiness, energy, it was like hitting that woman upside her head. She didn’t know how to deal with it because that is not what she is used to. She is more comfortable with her downgrade. She doesn’t want to spar with artistic and intellectual capabilities like yours. She can’t handle it.\n\n You hurt her feelings often simply by being you. When you gave her genuine expressions of love, she questioned them and pushed them away. You had to beg for kisses. Beg for sex. I don’t have to tell you how beautiful, sexy, and classy you are. You know it. People stop and stare at you everywhere you go because your beauty shines from the inside out. A psychotic banshee who has been neglected her whole life and damages others instead of fixing it cannot handle that. So don’t expect her back. Don’t accept her back. She can never give either one of us the life we deserve. She couldn’t maintain you. So she tried to talk you out of your confidence. She took advantage of your sweet nature. Fuck that. I’m never letting anyone do that again to you ever. I got you. \n\nWe are hitting the gym. We are taking vocal classes. We are working on our music. Our goal of one million by 2026 is quickly approaching. You would have never gotten there with Squidward because she’s lazy. She has no ingenuity. She has no creativity. She has to be left behind so we can ascend to the greatness she saw in you. \n\nLittle Marilyn, leave Squidwards dusty big head ass in her rat infested toxic dirt having house in the hood where you left her. You’re out of her league. She never deserved you. Notice me. Trust me. Pour into me. Love me. Because I am your biggest cheerleader. I love you. I am your ally. I know your worth and your capabilities. We have things to do, relationships to mend. New people to meet. \n\nLet’s go. \n\nLove, Big Marilyn\n\n",

I have not been often active on this sub specifically because I am living a very full life and have not had  much about narcs to rant about. \n\nI say this to point out that this sub will have a bias towards those of us who need a space to vent our frustrations and get information on dealing with narcissistic people in our lives, which is definitely a good thing. But I fear that sometimes users, particularly new users will get a sense of doom. I remember thinking and feeling, when will I ever get better? When will I recover from this experience? I just want to say, please know that because you're in the thick of it right now, it feels impossible to crawl out of. You might feel you are deep in the Amazonian jungle trying to make it back to civilization, but in reality, it's more like a hike here in the LA area, there are plenty of trails you can follow to your destination, people along the way rooting you on and you are not more than an hour away on foot back to the parking lot where you left your car. I hope my analogy makes sense lol\n\nRemember, there are many, many resources. There are many paths out. It doesn't matter which one you take, sometimes you will have to backtrack a little but you will be right back on the path if you allow direction from professionals (Dr. Ramani comes to mind but there are many more YouTube resources as well), there are books that help you dismantle your own thinking that makes you susceptible to narc abuse, and there are many people here who are now living better lives who can also suggest what has worked for them. \n\nI hope more users like myself make a point to post about what it's like from the other side. I tell you that you will navigate the world differently, the friendships and relationships you cultivate will be more intentional and you will even repel narcissists. Trust me when I say that with diligence, persistence, resilience, you will survive and thrive.\n\nHave a great Monday!",

They would always call me out about my radio silence even though they ghosted me for 3 months :/ After the breakup, they never did anything directly other than viewing my stories, always the first one to view btw, when they had access, and then posted about the breakup (I was not mentioned specifically) but they used my words and my favorite photo of them (at the time) to share the breakup on their post to receive validation. I did not engage with that. I was also the one to take initiative in blocking them from a new platform every other month.\n\nIt seemed like from previous knowledge; they made a big deal about their previous ex and left memories of her everywhere (i.e. photos and previous posts all over social media). They were no remnants of me to begin with, but I removed all the photos I had of them as well on my social media accounts. They really didn't care about me, and I told them that, their rebuttal, \"I wouldn't be in this relationship if I didn't care.\" funniest joke I've heard. anyhow, this was a while ago, I obviously have some unresolved feelings from this relationship.",

I just started a new job and so I have no control over my schedule. He's been doing me the \"favor\" of letting me borrow his car to get to and from work (mine broke down so I'm saving money to get it fixed). And now that's being taken from me too because he needs his car on the weekends. We had already had a discussion about car use and he's changed his mind. \n\nWe were still sleeping in the same bed (but not intimate for the last year that weve been broken up for) until a few weeks ago despite him having a new supply he spends the weekends with for the last three months. He agreed to go to couples counseling two months ago, and then when my insurance didn't cover it he changed his mind. He's been getting worse and worse with the way he talks to me and treats me. He wants me to move out asap. His new supply doesn't feel comfortable with coming to the house and she's  his \"priority\". I have never felt like his priority - in the beginning of our relationship he was still playing hero to the last person he was dating and refused to cut her off despite the fact that *I* was uncomfortable. He threatens to evict me (of course the house is in his name only) when we fight.\n\nAll the advice I'm getting is for me to get a second job, save up my money, and move out. Except that means dropping out of school, leaving my pets, selling all my stuff, and having to either move out of the state or live with a bunch of roommates barely scrapping by with no way to really finish my degree.\n\nI just started therapy for myself and I still feel so alone. I have no friends - he insisted we move closer to his job and so I was farther away from what few friends I did have. I have no family. I quit my job to go back to school and he encouraged me to do it. It took me years to get myself to where I was and it took him less than three years to take all that away from me.\n\nI feel so hopeless and alone. All I think about is that I wish someone would hug me. I can't remember the last time someone did. \n\nI feel like this horrible, needy, unlovable person because my life is falling apart and I can't seem to fix anything.

        "Text": "It has been 4 years of torture with this guy both physically and emotionally abusive. I have always felt used sexually so I'd also add sexually abused. Since he has been violently abusive including strangulation and plugging my nose and mouth I have decided that I want to keep the baby but completely cut him out of my life. \n\nThe fact that there is a baby inside of me that is pure innocence really changes my perspective. I always knew he had to be removed from my life but the bond I felt was so strong. However now that there is a baby in the picture I really need to protect it. I am 7 weeks into the pregnancy and I feel extremely devastated. I have PCOS and I'm 36 and have been sad for over 10 years because I thought I was never able to have a baby so I don't want to terminate it. I have the capacity and the means to raise and love this baby on my own even though I know it's going to be hard but right now I am really struggling with the feelings of withdrawals from going no contact. \n\nI last saw him about 2 weeks ago when I found out about it and he came by and used me again, manipulated me emotionally about working it all out and only 2 days later flipped out on me because I asked him to do something \"like today\" that he has put off for over a year. He was banging on my walls, telling me to get an abortion because it will never work, punching himself in the face while saying he was going to kill himself and broke a glass over his head right next to me showering me with shards of glass. He cut his hand on the glass, leaving blood and glass all over my room. \n\nAfter that day, he left and has gone fully silent. I tried to bargain for him to show he cares, but he ignored it all completely (discarded) so I blocked him and have gone completely no contact as of 3 days ago. I guess I'm here looking for support because I feel very devastated and alone. ",

        "Text": "On Monday I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks. This has been one of the hardest things I have ever went through and I just don’t feel like he is grieving. When it happened I was at my ultrasound appointment and I immediately called him. He cried and cried and eventually stopped and asked me “what I did”. And then apologized because “he lost something too”. I lost my baby. My baby that I had been waiting for and he knew that. When I first found out o was pregnant he wanted me to “get rid of it” because I told him I was better off doing it alone. We already have 2 sons and I’ve been raising for them 9 and 3 years by myself. He lives with his mom..the next day I had a D&C and he spent the night with me at my house because I couldn’t be left alone for 24 hours. That night I was really going through it. He told me we would have another baby when I’m ready and better. After my shower that night he was ready sexually. And I was mind blown because I just had surgery. How is someone this sick?. I said no he said “well can you just lay there etc”. He heard the doctor say 2 weeks. And it’s been a few hours. I felt then he didn’t respect me. How can you risk an infection? And who is even in the mood!? I kept telling him I lost my baby. He kept saying “I lost something too”. 2 or 3 days later I told him I was going to take something for depression and get back in college in May and work on myself and give my body a year to heal..he flipped because I didn’t run any of that by him. I “planned my year without consulting him”. He says I need to submit, that he is the man and I need him.. he also has been throwing a fit because my job and everyone that cares for me has went above and beyond to help me during the time. I’ve been out of work for a week and my job has taken a collection for me and there has been so many people trying to help me. He couldn’t stand it. He says we’re not in debt and don’t need charity. Mind you I’ve been taking care of him for a year and our sons for 9 and 3 years alone. He just got a job A MONTH AGO so yeah I would consider myself in debt🤣. He then said I would like to offer you financial help but even when he got paid I didn’t see any money. I felt like that was a snide remark to everyone else’s help. But even then I still didn’t get anything from him. \n\nHe thought the miscarriage would “bring us closer”. He suggested taking me out this weekend to get food and a drink AT MY JOB then coming home and “making love”. He hasn’t taken me on a date in over a year. And that’s what I get offered. I’m staring to think this will never change. He will always be this evil person…advice needed please. ",

        "Text": "Narcissists like to poke at their victims to see what type of reaction results or manipulate their victims to produce a specific reaction. Covert ones especially enjoy poking in ways that can appear innocent when viewed by anyone but the victim. They know their victim's triggers. They know that the tiniest of things, such as talking about their success while their victim suffers or purposely using the wrong words or emoji to respond to a text, can set off their incredibly stressed out victim. \n\nThe important thing to remember is that you can choose to not engage them when they do this type of thing. You can choose to ignore, gray rock or even clap back in your own subtle ways. What they want is an immediate, likely upsetting or attention-providing, reaction from you. They don't want a lack of interest. If they're discarding, they want you to be the one to blame for the relationship no longer working out. They want you to get angry or upset and say enough is enough or even beg them to stay and agree to whatever new terms they set for the relationship.\n\nBut why does what they want matter? I know it's hard. But, choose to not engage.",

        "Text": "This is my first post and I don’t really know what I’m doing but I needed to get this off my chest somewhere… if I’m violating some guideline please let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in a relationship with a narcissist and it destroyed my life. I was still being abused by him after I left, and I’m dealing with the consequences now. We were together for I guess only two years, it seems like it was more to me, but we met when I was 22 and I’m 24 now. \n\nWe started talking right after an ex and I broke up, and the way we connected I thought it was fate. There were things that were in common that seemed so impossible that I believed we were soulmates. There were red flags early on but I ignored them, he was a widower and single father and I thought certain things were him still recovering from that. He was supposedly significantly more wealthy. I was less than paycheck to paycheck, he promised to help me and he did. About 5 months into our relationship I quit my job because I thought I was in a financial position to do so, he was already telling me that his money was my money, I thought of him as my husband at that point. \n\nEverything was great until I moved in. \n\n(It wasn’t actually. But the explosive yelling and throwing of things. I was convinced it was my fault and I was promised it wouldn’t happen again.)\n\nI didn’t mean to move in. But I kept being told that he was paying all of my stuff and I wasn’t working, so I should be spending all of my free time with him. And I wanted to. Then my free time turned into all of my time. Every time I tried to plan something with friends or family, we would fight all night until I had to cancel. Then my car had battery issues. We “didn’t need to fix it” cuz I was spending all my time with him anyway.\n\nThen he quit his job. He “let himself get bought out” And financial issues began on top of that. Supposedly he had money. And multiple incomes. And he was supposed to go back to working, but not for the company he was “ceo” of. But then somehow his parents had control of his finances, and every single day I was begging him and supposedly he was begging them to fix everything. \n\nBut I couldn’t work. He kept telling me I didn’t need to, that he would take care of everything. And then it became that I was going to cheat on him if I was working. He thought I was cheating on him at my previous job. That’s why he wanted me to leave there. So I couldn’t work and be with him. \n\nThere would be money every month but it was never enough. He and his child would make outrageous purchases and act like nothing would happen. But I couldn’t say anything about that because he was helping pay my bills and some sick family member bills of mine. But then we’d run out of money every month and not be able to afford food. Then I had to start using my credit cards. Etc it was all… I was depressed. Suicidal. But I was so in love and I needed to be right because I couldn’t be wrong about him. That was my husband, my forever. We were supposed to move that summer. So I could be closer to my family again, he lived an hour away from them. I used to see my family almost every day then suddenly I didn’t see them for months. \n\nWe didn’t move until that February. And I missed so much of my family’s lives it still haunts me. I can’t get into details about all of it. But there was stuff I needed to be there for. I thought I was making up for it with the financial help. And convinced i’d be able to do more when he had control over his finances again. But he never did. There was never enough money ever. We moved closer to my family. But I only ever saw them if they came over. I couldn’t leave without it becoming a fight. Every time. \n\nBut then it became that I had to be in the room with him or he’d yell at me. Unless he was in the bathroom, and he’d be in there for hours at a time with “stomach issues”. But then I couldn’t just be in the room with him, I had to be actively paying attention and watching what he was doing. Or I’d be yelled at. He’d be “working on a project” all night and yell at me if I fell asleep in the chair watching him. If he was finally sleeping after days of being awake, I couldn’t leave the bed except to pick up and drop off from school. I couldn’t tell him no to sex without getting yelled at. But I wasn’t allowed to initiate either because I was distracting him. I wasn’t allowed to ask for anything too “risqué” either because I was “too precious” but he knew I enjoyed certain things and I’d be accused of cheating on him through text or if I had to leave, because I needed to “get it from somewhere”. There’s so much that I’m still not including in all of this that it’s just… it was all so much. \n\nIt got to the point I was being yelled at and degraded every day. I wasn’t allowed to sleep more than a few hours at a time. The only time I was allowed to be alone was when he was in the bathroom, I couldn’t even spend time with the children without getting in trouble for not spending time with him. Or if I spent too much time with mine it wasn’t fair to his. Or him. \n\nBut I couldn’t be alone, I needed to be accessible to “everyone”. I couldn’t put earbuds in to clean without getting yelled at.\n\nIt started to get physically abusive. A few weeks after that I ended it. And I was attacked. And he was arrested that night. \n\nI found out he was using. I don’t know why I didn’t guess he was. He confessed he was using, and told me that was his irrational behaviors, but that going to jail forced him clean and he was sorry.\n\nI stopped living with him. Moved out and got an apartment that he paid for. He promised to pay, that he would take care of everything and show me he was different. It’s been over 6 months since then. It didn’t change. \n\nWhat changed was how bad my financials got. I wasn’t okay mentally enough to work and I trusted and believed him when I shouldn’t have. He gave me a portion of the money I needed in January, told me I would get more. Then I didn’t. Then February and nothing. But he promised me every single day that I would get the money and I believed him. March, nothing. Then other things happened… I had to get a protective order. I got a job. But I got the job too late and the pay+ hours isn’t enough. Im trying so hard now and it isn’t, wasn’t enough. It’s too little too late because I was dumb and wanted a happily ever after, after an abusive childhood. Im about to lose the apartment and there’s nothing I can do. And the worst part is, is that all I want to do is talk to him. He could be facing felony charges for violating the po, I was being emotionally abused the way that he did violate it. And the only thing stopping me from reaching out to him was calling my friend after work today, and typing all of this out. \n\nI’m trying so hard. But I’m so scared that I didn’t start trying until it was too late. And there’s nothing I can do to fix it.\n\nI wanted to end this on a positive note. Because I’m out of the abusive situation. Things in my life are/could be so good. But I’m still facing so many consequences from being with the narcissist I was with, that I still feel like I’m wrapped up in it still.",

Still she thought that after backstabbing I should help her and get her a job and everything else. I told her to ask the guy whom she cheated me with and I went NC. \n\nThe thing is I wanted to ask that were your nex also money hungry but weren't able to earn even a single dime.

He apparently blocked me on her Facebook profile, but he wasn't smart enough to block me from his own page. So I choose to keep an eye on him.\n\nA few days ago, I noticed that he added a new female friend. Before, the only person on his list was my friend. Sounds benign, I know. But here's what bugs me about it: 1, this guy told my friend that in a real relationship that you can't have friends of the opposite sex. Yet here he is doing just that. 2, he doesn't use his real name on Facebook. So this new girl has to know it's him, right? She follows his \"professional\" Instagram page, but his name isn't there either. 3, she's younger and is a freshman at a local college here. 4, and this is just a weird coincidence - she has the same name as my friend.\n\nMaybe this isn't anything and I am reading too much into it. But I know he has control over my friend's phone constantly (he's blocked and deleted my number from her phone) and I wouldn't be surprised if he is keeping this from her. There are other complications too, but what do you all think? Is this guy setting up his new supply? Or am I just seeing connections where there aren't any? Thanks in advance. ",

Like he always wants more money, a better job, a nicer car...he never actually follows through and achieves any of this though. He procrastinates to where he hardly gets anything done yet he obsesses over these big dreams. He blames me for holding him back from his goals by being controlling and having too many rules. He cheated and I have had expectations about transparency and also with him traveling or staying in hotels. He says i have controlled him and he's right, I have, because i felt i couldn't trust him and he wouldn't make these decisions for himself all on his own. He's always trying to find a new business plan or do something different. He's also very  argumentative, even when it's not about sex. And he seems blind to the fact that he's just wrong in certain situations. Like he can scream at me and psychologically abuse me, but still blames me for his behavior and says sorry over and over. He continues to treat me bad and use my insecurities in fights to hurt me and blames me being insecure on other things, not his infidelities. it's like anything but accountability. Like he'll own things, but once he owns it he expects us to just move on.\n\nWhen i first sent him dare to connect podcasts, he seemed excited. He listened and called me and was laughing at himself. He kept saying he felt stupid and that all of it resonated with him. I can't help but wonder if he's just clinging to this and willing to accept it because he doesn't want to accept the real truth....that he's actually just using sex as he does many other things, for supply. I wonder if it's easier to accept sex addiction than a personality disorder. And how do I even get help for this? I'm honestly afraid of going to counseling with him.",

        "Text": "Narcissists have a fantasy in their minds. They are very detached from reality no matter which subtype they are. \n\nWhen a narc meets you and pursues you, it’s because you fit inside the fantasy. It’s a happy fantasy. It usually resembles the opposite of the broken, abusive, or neglectful upbringing that developed them into the narc you know today. \n\nThey love bomb you. It’s impossible to resist. They really believe they love you because at that time they really believe can help them achieve that dream. Understand it’s THEIR dream. \n\nOnce you say yes to the fantasy, now it’s a shared fantasy. All narcs will destroy this fantasy. It may happen quickly, it may happen slowly. But destruction will occur, and you will be destroyed. It could take one year. Five years. Maybe even 20. And for those 20 year plus survivors, my heart goes out to you. I know I couldn’t have lasted that long. I would have deleted myself long before that. \n\nOnce you are beginning to crumble, you are no longer idealized. Now you are the enemy. Hated. And you will be replaced with a new supply that isn’t crumbling. It could be one of their exes. It could be someone new. It actually doesn’t matter to the narc, unbeknownst to them. They actually are not aware they do this. It is compulsory. As natural as breathing for them. \n\nTheir cycle will start again. And you’ll be standing there. Destroyed. Spinning wondering why. \n\nMany people have asked me “how can they move on so fast? Like I never existed? Like I never mattered?” \n\nYou answered your own question. Because you didn’t matter. \n\nYour marriage meant nothing to them. Your commitment meant nothing to them.\nYour devotion is a utility for a narc. \n\nNarcs are transactional. Narcs are users. Even if they become aware they can’t stop it. Both their brains and their nurture have led them to be this way. \n\nThey leave quickly because they never belonged to you. You were never together. They interact with their fantasies only. You’re there for as long as you fit into it.\n\nOnce you don’t, it’s bye bye for you. \n\nLike you never existed \n\nBecause you never did. \n\n“Now my narc says I never did anything for him/her. How can they talk so bad about me?”\n\nYou’re no longer in the shared fantasy. Once outside the family, your hard work and dedication to them will be viewed how they really see you and what you’ve done. \n\nAs meaningless. Devalued. Worthless. \n\nBecause that’s how your narc feels about him or herself. ",

Her grandmother was determined to make her stop sucking her thumb during a time her father had died in front of her and her mom had a mental break and was being treated at their local Insane asylum….. great grandma put a chemical on my moms thumb that activated with her saliva.  I’m not talking like… edible anything.  An actual chemical.  I do not know what it was but I know it was placed on her thumb and it did enter her mouth…. It caused her significant distress that followed her to adulthood… my mom still sucks her thumbs in time of stress.  \n\nDo you think this qualifies as poisoning????\n\nAnd is there anybody out there that recalls the methods they used back then to stop a child from sucking their thumb??",

        "Text": "Hi, \n\n\nAfter 8 years of close friendship that within a few years turned into platonic life partnership I was discarded of. \n\nOut of absolutely nowhere during a phone call I was told that they felt that I was not doing enough in our relationship. I was shocked and desperate to understand I started asking why they thought that. The answer did not make a lot of sense and the call left me confused. We did agree on having a proper in person discussion about this so that gave me a little reassurance. \n\nThe following day I expressed my need to have the convo sooner rather than over a week but my message was left on read. For days  I did not hear anything which is something that in all our years of friendship had never occurred. I made a conscious decision not to send additional messages because I did not want to overwhelm them and gradually I started to feel more and more upset about it. \n\nAbout a week had passed before I finally got a message and we confirmed a date and place. I decided not to express my frustration over text. I was accused of not pulling my weight in the relationship, not working hard enough in general and being jealous of their success including their career, new bike and apartment. It again was so shocking to hear and I did my best to counter everything that was thrown at me. \n\nThe year before had been an especially rough one for me often times paralyzed by anxiety and depressive episodes but whenever they were sick and called me, I rushed over to take care of them. I had never wanted something that they had for myself. I had expressed feeling overlooked and unhappiness about my career but as I told them this was separate from them. \n\nIt was all so surreal to hear and then also all these things at once. They suggested to put the friendship on pause for a few months and we’d have another conversation then. I agreed. \n\nIn that time I got to process all that had happened and was looking very much forward to say my piece when we met again. \n\nOf course that never came. After what I felt was being bombarded with absurd but also very hurtful statements I refused to be the first one to send a message after the date had come for us to meet again. Moreover since they had initiated it and were the one who ghosted me for a week the last time. About a month went by before I foudn myself in a good enough spot mentally and decided to message. \n\nI was brief yet warm and then received a break-up text. They had done some thinking and it was over wishing me the best and that we’d probably still see each other. \n\nThat message shot through me. My defense mechanism kicked in and I decided not to respond and block them on every platform. I wrote a letter to still be able to say my piece but decided to not send it after all. \n\nThe only way I could make any kind of sense of this even during the ghosting was that they were having some kind of mental issues and probably a mental breakdown. Learning afterwards about narcissism it made perfect sense. Happy that I made the decision to not pursue and eventually not to engage further. \n\nIt has been a year and I am still making sense of it. I returned to being a loner as I was before I met them and have found renewed faith in myself by standing alone. \n\nEven writing about them is something that my pride almost won’t let me do because they’ve taken already so much of my time and energy but I need to get this out and am thankful for this forum whoever ends up reading this. Much love. \n\n\n",

I truly believe she has some sort of personality disorder that caused all the abuse she put me through my whole life but I can’t tell if it was narcissistic in nature or not, so I guess I’ll do a small trauma dump here and see if any of yall can see your own experiences reflected. \n\nOne of the main reasons I feel she is narcissistic is that I find myself second guessing my abusive childhood. When I look back I think “that couldn’t possibly have been as bad as I remember” and it’s mostly in her voice that I hear it. She always needed to be the victim, no matter the issue, if she started something or misconstrued something, it was always a personal attack against her. For instance, I’m agender, all I ask is that my parents don’t call me a man and my mom has struggled a lot with that. A few months ago when I confronted her about it and I told her I felt like she didn’t try very hard she burst into tears and ran inside. She hid in her room and shrieked like a banshee for hours. She also despises my partner and keeps telling me they are taking advantage of me and when I disagree, she again flips out and puts on the guilt trip. Whenever my dad and her would get into an argument it was always made out to be him attacking her, being hateful and mean. When she got written up for being a total bitch to one of her employees it was a grand conspiracy to get rid of her. Any time I told anyone about the abuse I suffered it was her character being dragged through the mud, “great no everyone will hate me” was a common thing I heard. \n\nDoes that sound like a narcissist to the people in here?

        "Text": "Hi,\n\nThis is a lot more layered than just the one-on-one relationship with my former BFF. Ultimately I see now that they are tremendously skilled in manipulation and I was brought into and got stuck in their toxic social web.\n\nAfter 8 years the relationship with my platonic life partner (also referred to each other as BFF’s/Best friends/Chosen siblings) abruptly came to an end. For me it was like out of nowhere and being the thinker and feeler that I am I started reflecting on what happened immediately. \n\nThanks to the help of my mother I was able to quickly piece the things together. Even though I am not an expert on the subject nor is my mother it became clear to me that this person (Let’s call them  ‘T’) was a narcissist.\n\nThe most helpful and clear sign probably was to be able to see a pattern of quite drastic ending of relationships. Before me they had abruptly ended similar best friend-labeled relationships with others. \n\nWhen T and me became friends they were already part of a very close group of friends. I naturally joined but due to me and T working together and following pretty much the same overall trajectory when it came to our careers it allowed us to spend way more time with each other than the rest. \n\nNot long after one of the friends became a parent the very close friendship between T and them ended. Venting to me over a gradual period of time that they had outgrown them. \n\nA few years later I was the one having an issue with the two remaining friends. One I had really ever only been frenemies with. I found myself constantly holding my tongue while enduring (what I know would call) bullying. It was this absolute fact that I was a newcomer to the group and that before me they already had formed an unbreakable foundation between the three of them. \nThis frenemy would be openly rude to me, telling me I was new as well as starting group chats excluding me and pick on me in other ways but because “this was just how they were” nothing was said about it by anyone.\n\nOn the rare occasion when it crossed the very last line for me I would stand up for myself. Mostly though I’d just try to ignore it and do my best keeping the peace, still hopeful to better our bond somehow. \n\nNow the other remaining friend (let’s call them ‘J’) we got along great. They were having a hard time at some point and I reached out often only to have to wait quite long for responses and if I did get one everything would always be “all right” even when I and the whole group knew they weren’t. They had a hard time opening up I was told by I believe T. \n\nWhen I asked J directly at a Christmas party and even if it had to do with me personally they denied it and assured me everything was fine.\nMonths later after less frequently still reaching out from time to time and receiving even a greater lack of response I insisted on talking about that things did not seem fine. \n\nThey then confessed that they indeed were not and that they had been offended by me at that Christmas party thinking that they would have something against me. I was taken by surprise and it left me very confused and also upset with them. Because I explicitly asked them if something was wrong and now me trying to help and wanting to talk things through was somehow an issue.\nAn issue that they apparently had held onto for months and passive-aggresively took out on me after me making it clear that there was room to talk about things. \n\nSharing my frustrations with T they agreed and now I cannot recall if I was the one coming up with the idea to end the friendship with J or they did. However they themselves told me that they had outgrown the relationship with J as well as with the frenemy and was going to end both. This surprised me even though I especially with the frenemy completely understood. Still there were question marks that I think I shoved away because it felt like too much a relief to not have to be part of that group anymore. \n\nSo then for years it was pretty much just the two of us and we became even closer which I hadn’t thought was a possibility given how much we were bonded by the hip already. (Lol this kind of reads like a cliffhanger but to not overload on info I’ll continue in a separate post. Also not until writing this I realized I needed to get this group situation of my chest as well. Thank you for taking the time to read. X)\n",

It is documented on here, in my journals, in the scars on my heart, my therapy bills, my meds, friendships, failed subsequent relationships, and fear of letting getting anyone get too close bc of how damaged I feel and because of my low self with.\n\nI friggen made it 10 months no contact. Longest ever. So close to a year. I was so proud of that. I made so much mental progress. I started thriving in my life again, having moments of happiness, working on myself truly, feeling optimistic, people kept noticing and telling me it was happiest/best they have seen me in a long time, that it was “my year” I finally started my business, the one my ex said i could never do bc “I can’t help anyone bc I can’t help myself” I got the courage to ask for a raise at work, found joy in my hobbies again, and lost 30 pounds.\n\nI got naive that I had reached a point where I could safely contact my ex. It was so foolish, I wanted him to know I wasn’t broken anymore, I was beginning to feel more hole, and that I wasn’t fully destroyed. I texted him to tell him just that I was doing well- it wasn’t provocative it just was I guess for meant to be closure.\n\nOpening that door, I had no idea what emotions were going to flood in. I was so naive to think I was ready or ever would be, and didn’t realize how quickly the pain can resurface and for me to get trapped into a cycle I thought I was in the clear of- he answer, he apologized, I saw him, he said he changed too, he was nice, kind. Love bombing all over. I realized way too late what no contact means really- no contact for good. The finality of it gives me such bad anxiety I am working so hard on this.\n\nI came to another site for strength to go no contact again and to get thru this hurdle. I met someone on here who was kind, judgmental, and messaged me on here, then we started google chatting, eventually texting. I tried to go no contact cold turkey, ended up having severe panic attacks and this person told me cold turkey may not be best for now and that was ok- my therapist also tried to get me to do no contact cold and then when he saw how it affected me, he agreed we need to move a little slower but that it wont take “as long this time”.\n\n This new website  friend was kind tried to explain to me that the addiction I was real, my feelings/emotions were valid- I felt seen, and understood and supported during a difficult thing.\nI told this nee “friend” I was struggling and tempted to see the ex again and how I was struggling with separating the truth and what I know is true vs. the emotions which he assured me was normal and ok- then a few hours went by next day- my messages were blown up, he accused me of being with the ex and saying that he couldn’t help me if I was still with him and that I didn’t seem “in withdrawal” anymore- and that wasn’t true I was just busy. He blocked me and when this caused me more panic attacks,\n\n I messaged on on the site  he left me a VM apologizing and told me he was sorry and that he had “Feelings for me” I told him that I was in no position for that- we talked it out and he agreed to still be there for support and that he could still be a safe space for this.\n\nThen it kept shifting - for a whole week it was ebbs and flows of this argument and then telling me they cared, were a safe space, weren’t going anywhere to  blocking unblocking etc, until tonight, he shattered me.\n\n I am ashamed to admit that when he blocked me I felt as small as I did when my ex would do this to me as punishment, and I begged, just like I swore I never would to anyone ever again, for this person to talk to me.\n\nFlash forward to today. All the sudden, he went from apologetic about hurting me and how he was so sorry and wanted to make it up to me and create a safe space again how he knew he hunted me etc, to a complete switch.\nHe accused me of “baiting him”, of lying about being sick, having a therapist, having an ex at all, and kept saying I am “extremely dangerous” I feel sick, scared, and terrified. It is like he is confirming all my biggest fears. I have years of documented therapy, journals about my ex, documented posts on Quora, he heard my live panic attacks on phone and taught me how to control my breathing, and now he believes I am some calculated monster. I struggle with this- I have asked in therapy and maybe on here if I am the narcissist? my therapist has tried to assure me by asking and feeling all these feelings, and emotions that I am not and I am trauma bonded, that this is an addiction I am trying to break.\nsomehow this interacting with this quora person has me feeling shattered, like someone has spilled cold water all over me and I feel broken and scared. All my fears confirmed- I am broken beyond repair. Now I am a monster too.\nCan anyone please offer me any insight ?",

I still feel very foggy, second guess everything and just feel terrible, like I can't trust myself. \n\nWhen he initially isolated me from everyone, my friends or family had no idea. He'd always tell me to not discuss our relationship or to keep it a secret until we're stable and in a better space. I agreed with it because I am a private person, but at the same time I'd definitely mention it to my closest friends in an ideal situation. I didn't tell anybody but the first time I tried to get out after a really bad incident I felt so free like I'd just managed to escape from prison. I told my close friends and my family about it and I was very shaken up for a few weeks there but went back the minute he contacted from a new number. This happened a few times.\n\nAfter this there have been a few instances of me discussing what has happened and how he really is with other people, mostly my friends but I accidentally shared things with two of his friends. The first one was concerned but didn't say anything. I don't think she would've mentioned it to him because he would've definitely gotten angry.

It caused their friendship to end and our breakup but he thinks I've ruined his reputation and now everybody thinks he's a bad person when he hasn't done anything.\n\nHe would always blame me, right from the beginning before anything even happened of badmouthing him, ruining his reputation and bitching about him when in fact while some people thought he was great, other people thought he was a liar, misogynistic and would just say negative things anyway. He'd blame me for not defending him. Whenever I have shared things with people I've stuck to the facts, haven't fabricated or exaggerated and even tried defending him. I had so much guilt and was constantly made to feel that it was my fault and the things I did. I told them what I thought I did wrong at that point too. \n\nI still have this guilt and feel like I am badmouthing him and ruining his reputation which he really cares about and considers to be perfect otherwise. At this point I'm scared of ever talking about him to anyone else now that I'm out because I don't want to ruin his reputation. \n\nIs it normal to discuss these things with people? How often did you discuss your narc's behavior with other people when you were with them? Did you still talk about it after things ended or did you refrain from it?",

        "Text": "I was just looking for adivice or encouragement \n\nI had severe narc abuse in my life. (Both my parents have npd and i think it leaked into my other relationships making me a narc magnet because I never developed a strong sense or core or learned about how to protect myself from abusers growing up).\n\n However one thing that always bothered me and still does sometimes was when I put up a boundary or ended the friendships they would start slandering me to people and spreading lies making them look like the victim. The worst narc spread lies about me to like 20 people. it’s like they would tell anyone who listened. And it wasn’t just normal lies sometimes it was also lies about me doing illegal things like driving drunk and just being a really horrible person in general. lol. However they could twist things. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of people would believe them and “side” with them. I never stood up for myself back then because I didn’t have a solid sense of self or core until my late twenties/early thirties(prob why I was an easy target) which I regret now. \n\nI have grown as a person and don’t make those friendships now but just the lies and rumors that were spread still bother me sometimes to this day. I think I am a severe case. The person I’m mostly upset at tho is myself for not standing up for myself. \n\nI guess I’m just wondering if anyone has dealt with this how to deal with it and move on when you know you will probably never get justice or the person will never face consequences for there actions.",

        "Text": "I’m 2+ years post healing from narc abuse. Lately I’ve found myself wondering how much peace people actually feel after internally forgiving their past abuser.\n\nFor myself and most others, I know a conversation for “closure” from a narc is a scam and will most likely lead to talking in circles, manipulation, then shifting the blame to you, etc. so I know a conversation is not on the table. I’ve been no contact with them for over 2 years and I still haven’t found internal peace or closure. Everything inside of me is telling me that I don’t know who I truly am anymore. I’ve lost all sense of self, I have a hard time making & maintaining friendships, it’s hard to hold down jobs, and I rarely feel a sense of safety. My abuser took so much from me and I know that I can never forgive them, especially since they publicly play victim even still.\n\nWhat does “forgiveness” even do? I see blind forgiveness as an internal gesture that does absolutely nothing mentally or physically. How can I ever forgive someone who took away so much of myself from me? \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Am I crazy for not wanting to feel forgiveness in any way? \n\n\nEDIT: I’m just now realizing after reading a few comments that my religious upbringing (almost decades long gone) has left this toxic lasting impact of the need to give forgiveness no matter what. I realize now that that’s not the case and this has been engrained in my brain for ages now. My empathy and compassion have gotten me into a lot of trouble with people who take advantage of it, and I’m pissed at the church for preaching that narrative to me.",

I would’ve been living in hotel rooms like him & constantly trying to do any & everything to satisfy his selfishness & broken ego. When we were together, he would encourage me to not go back to school because it would’ve “taken time away from us.” However, unbeknownst to him, I wasn’t put on this planet to be his walking, talking, breathing, doormat or yes (wo)man. I immediately cried happy tears when I saw the word in all caps on my acceptance letter that read: “CONGRATULATIONS!” 🥹🤍\n\nThe silver lining in all this is that I found out he likes to lurk this sub & see whatever it is that I’m posting on here but I don’t care. Life is too precious for me to waste away on some unemployed loser who thinks he’s god’s gift to women.\n\nTo end this on a positive note, I’m majoring in my school’s paralegal program. After I finish, I’m going back for criminal justice. In the future once I’m done with my criminal justice degree, I want to further my education & attend grad school for Criminology & Criminal Justice. The goal is to work in some capacity for the state or federally at the DOJ. It’s gonna be a huge challenge but I’m up for the task! 🙏🤍",

        "Text": "So here is the thing. I got involved with this person a while back who is Somatic Covert/Vulnerable NPD comorbidity of Histrionics and ADHD and some other things in the mix which are speculative at this point. Ya she would benefit from \"honest\" therapy for sure. There was manipulation from the first day I met her and the intensity was increasing by every interaction. The warning sign were all there, black and white thinking, rapid mood shift, lies, contradicting her own statements, emotional dysregulation, immaturity, need to be center of attention and on and on.  Took me a couple of weeks but by the time I realized what was happening, I did everything I could to gently extricate from this situation until a situation happen for which I was unprepared for (3 weeks later while i was making it look like i am giving her space) and I had to ignore her when she wanted to be recognized and this started a new round of toxic behavior; thought it best to minimize interactions outside a group setting. A lot of passive-agressive, non-verbal, gaslighting(I never said that) and some of the behavior was outright abusive/rude(no verbal filter, insinuation and insults) and this too in group setting, staring and on and on. I literally had 2 interactions with her since i started to distance myself. I think she doesn't understands or her situational awareness is that low. I am not angry or upset at her, because she can't help it and another NPD that I know is not sure this is at all conscious, its just severe devaluation due to precieved rejection.\n\nI sent her this message:  “I’m not going to take this silent treatment personally like you’re  hoping. I know this is happening because you feel hurt and don’t know  how else to express yourself. I’m here when you’re ready to talk but in  the meantime I’m going to take care of myself and distance myself from you.” This message was literally crafted by an NPD for this very purpose.\n\nThe idea was to force her to change strategies if it was conscious, and in case this is unconscious get her stop it, since benefit of doubt has to be given as most of it is not active malice. As one would expect, there was an immediate discard which followed. Not upset about it again, which was to be expected as a possibility. My impression is that she possesses self-awareness but lacks control over her actions.\n\nAnyway after the discard, she goes into a severe shame spiral, and here is where things got messy. I started feeling very sad for her, like I don't have words for the guilt I was feeling, it was tormenting me. She did not choose this, its not her fault(thoughts like that) but because of that message she now suspected that I know of her conditions especially since there is stigma around it. Her shame spiral was severe, and even a blind man can't miss it was. She seemed like she would cry every time she saw me, it was overwhelming. The situation was bad alright; likely splitting, general anxiety, possibly paranoia and a bunch of other things. Stopped some of her actives she was doing to manage her ADHD I guess. There was a lot more to this which i am glossing over so I was worried.\n\nI was speaking to another friend who is a doctor but not for cluster B. She kept on telling me to avoid her and get out of her sight or forget it regarding how much it hurts her since she is not really hurt, its just her fragile ego which got hurt which is not the same thing as emotionally being hurt. I mean I felt horrible seeing her like this and really wanted to do something but I avoided her.\n\nDon't ask me why. I engaged in a risky \"re-masking\" activity, which left me vulnerable, yet I couldn't bear to witness her in that pitied condition. To prove to her and her family(who were clearly worried since we are in a country where everything is stigmatized) that I am not a threat. Its very embarrassing what I did so not going to share it. I really had pulled a miracle, even though I was not able to execute even 50% of this plan due to an unforeseen development, without having any contact with her. Then I went no contact with her and everyone associated with her since I was in a high risk zone already.\n\nIt worked surprisingly, but don't know why but her relative's recent behavior had me wondering what was going on (what do they think is going on), and the girl's recent behavior (I got curious and stupid and broke no contact), point to the fact that there she may have have done a reverse revenge hoover and a triangulation once it became clear to her that I really don't know anything. This is just disappointing and insulting I mean I fail to see the reason why she would do it? She should have just take that win. Seems like just out of boredom or for the hell of it. I mean I stick my neck out for her and she uses it to get supply out of it? Shame on you that was low.\n\nI'm hoping it's simply a case of poor situational awareness on her part. Otherwise, it appears planed, like a reverse revenge hoover and triangulation all to assert control no doubt to settle some perceived score. Else the amount of energy and thought she spent on planning is just plain disturbing. I should be angry but I am not just disappointed. It's sad, especially considering I was increasing distance between us and limited all interactions. Reflecting on it, I realize I should have maintained strict no contact from the start.\n\nThey'll never express gratitude or appreciation because they lack awareness of it, no matter what you do for them. Don't invest your empathy in those who see it as a weakness and have no construct of it. This will always be the case until she chooses the hard path of therapy and I am not talking about putting in the hours but choosing the path.\n\nP.S. I really hope she recognizes that self awareness and healing is not the same thing. I grieve for her. She was a sweet girl, full of life and energy. I hope she finds peace and heals.",

        "Text": "So me (m25) and my girlfriend (f28) have been together for 6 years. The first year or two was great, we would do lots of things together and our sex life was great. I do think in hindsight we moved a bit fast, we moved in with each other about 6 months into the relationship, at the time it seemed like a good idea for both of us. But anyways after the second year things seemed to change, sex became more infrequent to the point where it’s has been pretty non-existent for the last 3 years, maybe a dozen times in that time frame but it always feels like I’m imposing it on her. Most of the time when I try to be intimate with her I get shut down immediately. She doesn’t really enjoy doing things to me or having things done to her, which was not the case when we first were together. I’ve tried asking her what is causing her trouble with it, I try to be understanding, probably more than most. But she always deflects and says that she doesn’t know or blames on on something to do with me. First it seemed to be my weight I did gain some weight in the earlier years of our relationship, going from 200lbs to 280, which I can understand may cause some issues with loving me. But I worked really hard over the course of a year to lose 70lbs, and I think I look rather nice now ( I don’t have very high self esteem when it comes to how I look, but I try to look appealing to her ). But it changed nothing, the excuses just shifted from my weight to other parts of my appearance, she always wants me to looks a specific way for her, even if it’s not what I really want. Also she is always telling me that we need more money, which until this past year I have always made more money than her, and was always more than happy to provide more towards the household. I work a job that I absolutely hated for her just because the money was really good ( 50k a year for a 23 year old with no degree at the time I’d say is pretty good, not to boast at all ). Anyways I was not happy at the job as it was something I didn’t really care about but it was also draining me with 60 hr work weeks, she didn’t understand that I would rather work a lesser paying job to just be a bit more happy, every time now I bring up issues I have with our relationship now I just get it thrown in my face that I no longer make the most money I the household and that I need to focus more on building a retirement and quit working where I am now. I now work for a business my best friend owns, the pays okay and I’m a lot happier with my work life now, and even tho the economy is kinda shit rn we still have excess money. But it’s not enough for her, I’ll admit that I’ve kinda givin up emotionally with her which I feel horrible about I just feel like nothing I have done is enough. I feel like I’ve done so much to change and try and grow with her but she doesn’t wanna do the same. My friend reluctantly brought the idea up to me that she may be a narcissist, and after doing some reading online the corilation between what I read and things she’s done/said over the years is uncanny. I really love this women and there’s so much more I can add to this post but  I’m sure it’s to long already, but I really wish I could make it work wit her but I’m afraid It’s impossible. All that to say I need help knowing if there’s something I can do or if I’m just in the wrong completely?\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend of 6 years no longer likes being intimate with me and is always criticizing me about my appearance and my work even though I don’t see any issues with ether anymore.

        "Text": "(ME 28F w/ 25M met over online game, friends for a month first) First three days after expressing attraction for each other he told me he loved me, opened up to me about deep stuff,  and I opened up to him. I was hesitant in the beginning but he said it would be better if I learned to trust him and say what's on my mind. So I did and it got extremely intense. He told me we are soulmates, and he knew I was the one for him, he never felt this way about anyone in his life. I fully believed him which was my first mistake. He said 5 days later I should be his GF and he will marry me one day. He told me to move to his state, and he would pick me up from the airport. Future planning ,everything, the works. The late night conversations we had left me feeling like I was in a whole other world. I would close my eyes and listen to his voice, and it felt like I was right next to him, in my own fantasy. It was intoxicating, the 'I love yous' were so plentiful, the sweet talking truly lifted me higher than I have ever been. He called me 10-12 times a day, we would talk or stay on VC for hours, never hanging up so we could go right back to 'spending time together' whenever we finished up a task. He said he was always rushing to finish what he needed so he could be with me again, because I was the one, I was his first, only and last love.  We fell asleep together on VC, I'd fall asleep listening to his sweet talking and I'd hear it first thing in the morning when I woke up. \n\nAnd then it all changed, like the drop of a hat. (2 weeks this lasted, 8-12 hrs a day)\n\nHe would call me on and off, but now had nothing else to say. He would stay quiet on the phone, telling me he's watching stuff on youtube or playing a video game. He said because of his ADHD he can't focus on having conversations with me anymore and that the first two weeks were too much for him, and it wasn't healthy to talk that much. Now this I agree on, but **he** was the one calling me, checking up on me, wanting to VC and stay on the phone with me as long as possible. He would nap and say he needed me on the phone. \n\nWhite lies starting to come out on why he didn't want to talk. I asked him to continue being emotionally intimate with me. He said he now wanted to take his time with getting to know me and for me to get to know him. Then the cyber sex. He started to call me just for cyber sex - I told him it's a trigger of mine to be sexually intimate and for him to leave afterwards to game. Every time he did it he said he forgot, he's sorry, and won't happen again. This happened more times then I can count. Whenever I would point out how he isn't talking to me, meeting my needs etc. he would say he's sorry, he understands, and he will try and change. After I would get upset and express what I need, he would turn it into something sexual and say he was aroused. I was like he got off on me getting upset. \n\nThe anxiety I started to feel about him was unwavering. I thought I was going crazy, I thought it was ROCD, and I was having small panic attacks every night. Whenever I would get vulnerable about how I feel, he would listen for about 15-30 min, throw some words, and then say he had to go game. We always said we would communicate with each other and always work it out, because we are meant to be together. But as time went on and I communicated with him, I found that he started to resent me for it. He avoided being home so he wouldn't call me, and in the end he said that he doesn't take criticism well, and that it feels like I am pressuring him (to have conversations with me and be emotionally intimate). Whenever I would speak up about not liking how he treats me, he would punish me by witholding affection/intimacy/talking to me. \n\nI am struggling to figure out if he is a narcissist, or if I was too needy. I am leaning towards narcissism, because of the love bombing, future faking, breadcrumbing, and the sudden switch.  Now I think I have been discarded, but with bits of breadcrumbing in there. I am hurt, because the image I had of him was so strong, I thought he was perfect for me, but then as time went on I realized that the person I fell for wasn't him, it was an image he made up for me to hold onto. We initially had so much in common, we were finishing each others thoughts. After those two weeks, it felt like I was talking to a wall and that we never had anything in common from the start. \n\nTwo weeks ago he took a day break from calling me, came back and said he needs more \"me time\" and to be alone more. He said we will still chat, but whenever he would call it would be more nothingness. The calls became less and less. A week ago he said that he thinks we need to take it slow, but that I am perfect and he still sees himself with me, he's sure of it and he knows, but he doubts if I feel the same. This past week, we've only talked over message. I don't ask him to call me, and he's still said that he loves me and I've said it back, but now that I haven't heard his voice in a while, it feels like a veil has been lifted, and I am coming to the realization this maybe this was all a fantasy. Today I barely messaged him (once) and for the first time in a week he said he missed me tonight. I haven't responded. \n\nI know I have abandonment issues, but I have never felt this amount of anxiety and unease from a past relationship. Never in my life. I gave him all my time, love, and affection, as much as I could. I helped him through a gambilng addiction lapse, a time that he tripped from accidentally smoking someting laced, and through other dramas. He is a virgin, never been in a relationship, and said he thought he would be alone forever because he never connected with anyone. I fell for the love bombing, the intermittent reinforcement, and now I feel empty without it. \n\nFor reference, we became friends in late Dec., expressed feelings for each other in early Jan., and now 2 months in he is a complete different person, someone I don't recognize. It feels like I can't trust myself anymore, and that is why I have come here. Did I fall for a narc, or am I just batshit crazy? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Text": "As the title says, 4 years of post separation abuse from my pandemic nex (of whom I dated for *only* three months). The whole time he stalked and harassed not only myself, but any & everyone else who he could possibly contact that had known me in some way/shape/form. This also included doxxing me, contacting my job, & making fake social media accounts of me. He’s also successfully hacked into my social media accounts & likes to pay people to record me on his behalf (because according to him, “I’m not allowed to have a life without him” — typical narcissistic behavior).\n\nAs bad as all of this sounds, it wasn’t until I contacted the FBI by means of an IC3 form that saved my life (literally). Not only did I provide information about the constant stalking and harassment, but also how he sells narcotics over state lines. Which included, but was not limited to, giving them a laundry list of where he purchases his narcotics & where/who he then sells them (to).\n\nAfter doing this, the post separation abuse, stalking, & harassment reduced greatly, if not completely eliminated. And even the few times that he attempts to contact me, it’s ignored. He has no power over me anymore. And I think exposing him the way I did by literally existing on this planet was the best way to show everyone how truly sick he is.\n\nBut that’s all beside the point.\nThe point is that I’m getting my life back after his post separation abuse. With some help from my therapist & mom, I took all of the hate & jealousy that he has for myself & others, wrapped it up neatly, & gave it all back to him. I am not responsible for his pain or anger. It’s HIS job to regulate his emotions & reactions to me living on this planet without him. He’s not god’s gift to women. He is chaos incarnate. The previous girl he dated before me said that he causes chaos everywhere he goes & honestly, I absolutely agree. When he’s around my soul is disturbed, when he’s away everything is peaceful. I’d rather choose peace over chaos (personally speaking). \n\nShortly after he found out that I contacted the FBI, he spiraled out in a bad way. But I don’t care. He’s a grown man, he’ll figure it out. But I’m not going to bet money on it.\n\nI sidestepped his spiral 🌀 & enrolled in college for the fall 2024 semester for their paralegal program. Once I’m finished with that I’m going to go back & get my criminal justice degree, take the LSAT & attend law school. The goal is to become a DA or work in some capacity for the DOJ. I would’ve never been able to accomplish this if I were to decide to give in & take him back. His narcissism would’ve seen it as a threat or personal attack. Or he would’ve accused me of cheating on him with someone in my class (something he loved to do while we were together—I found out that he did that because he’s a master at projection & was guilty of having a secret relationship behind my back. So he blamed and punished me all the time for the crappy things he was doing behind my back.)\n\nIn the meantime I go to the library every day to study for my uni’s placement test & attend local support groups for this exact purpose. I’ve found friendships in my recovery groups & I don’t fear leaving my house anymore. Do I think he’s going to stop? Probably not. But I’m not scared of him. He can try to destroy me as much as he wants but with these new friendships I’ve made, it’s helped me realize that anything he says or does doesn’t matter. Because my character & authenticity shines through. And he hates that. He hates himself so of course me living a life that has nothing to do with him is gonna feel like a kick to the balls. But I don’t care. He made his bed. Now he has to sleep in it. Just like his father.\n\nAlthough I’m pretty busy with getting prepared for classes, I’m learning to let some of my major walls down that I had to keep up while my nex was stalking & harassing me. Not only am I “finding my tribe” of sober friends (I have 4 years of recovery ❤️‍🩹), but I’m also open to dating sober people & just living a happy, healthy, non chaotic life. \n\nSorry for the length of this post but I promise you. It gets better. It takes time but once you really realize how parasitic these kind of people are, it gives you the ability to see that they’re a walking red flag & grateful that y’all are 🎶 “never ever ever getting back together.” 🎶",

        "Text": "Hey everyone. I (22F) recently left my n-household and started my no-contact healing progress. It's going fine, I'll have a job interview this week and try to do as much as my psyche is allowing me. I am still plagued by feeling doubtful of myself but I am trying my best to get through this.\n\nI had this friend (35M) for around 2 years, they helped me a lot through this tough time. At least I thought so. It was mostly about them and their unrequited love of a woman who was in a relationship and his hour-long rants about \"how they would be so much better! Her boyfriend is a slug!\". He was always how emphatic he was and \"Women don't like nice guys like me! I will forever stay alone\" after he made fun of people and gossiped about them for hours on end. I tried giving him advice on how to become happy and that being spiteful and always gossiping wouldn't bring them far; but in his realm, he was more of an \"Askhole\". Whenever I tried to cheer him on it was like a black hole sucking everything in and returning nothing. Nothing was good enough and he would sulk and sulk and sulk about how bad his life was and how alone he was. It's always him being treated wrong and I quote: \"I don't have to change anything and I also don't need psychological help, I am over all of this.\". He more and more reminded me of how my parents would act, most likely my covert N-Mother. She was always above everyone's critic of her. Funnily enough he would of course be against the abuse of my family and condemn it. While he loved to future fake and he also enjoyed making fun of me with backhanded comments. You may wonder why I took this for around 2 years and I am happy to answer you: I didn't see it like this. I just realised all of this because I have been reflecting on our friendship for the past three weeks. I saw him as a poor misunderstood soul that needs a pat on the back but nah-ah after he has been ghosted by his whole friend group after the boyfriend got tired of him trying to homewreak he leeched onto me and just used me as an ego substitution. I kept a male version of my mother close all this time and let him trample over me! I brought my concerns up to him because I wanted to make sure my thesis was right and what do you think happened?\n\nHe first answered in a passive-aggressive way, I saw that in my phone's notification screen. The edited version I got was 2 sentences long and just kinda told me that he was the victim/hurt, he didn't know what to say and well he was sorry if he hurt me. That confused me. SO he doesn't know what to say but he is sorry for -something-? I answered him that I respected that and understood and afterwards I didn't hear anything from him no more. It's been almost 3 weeks now. I am now seeing that he conveniently crawled back to his old friend group he hated and condemned so much and he is even putting derogatory things in his bio for me to see. I will remove him soon. He took me out of my friend group, used me as a vocalboard, trauma dumped me, insulted me, now ghosted me and now even backstabbed me. He really was a wolf in sheep clothing and its just so mind-boggling that he was the one to complain about my family treating me like garbage while he did the same.\n\nIt will take a lot of time to unlearn being a narc-magnet but I am working on it. I will start blocking people more frequently from now on because I do not have the mental capacity right now to bother with these emotional vampires! People that love you will not do this and expect you to always break your back. Please take care, everyone.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Text": "Hello  everyone, I am here seeking advice. My girlfriend has been dealing with  her narcissistic parents for quite some time. She does not have a  reliable access to internet to be able to finish school and she is  paying for her own cellular data as a result of the lack of internet.  She lives in Massachusetts, I live in California, and we both don't have  much money, she is especially running low on money, and does not make  enough from her job. She cannot go out and apply for another job as she  needs her social security and her parents have claimed to have lost  everyone's documents, including hers. My girlfriend's parents have full  control of her bank account, and she cannot gain that control unless she  has her social security (to transfer the account into her name).  Fortunately, she has her passport and her debit card, but not her social  security or her birth certificate (she paid for a new birth certificate  but we believe her parents stole it from mail when she was gone at  school). Her parents don't like me and they claim that they won't her to  leave and want her to stay with them and that they're \"protecting her\"  but they've spied on her text messages by locking parental controls on  her iPhone and continued to do so even when she turned 18, only recently  did they take off controls when she came to see me but those controls  were placed on her phone for her going to the school about her parents  and her mom yelled at her for 7 hours straight and sped with her in the  car because she was angry. I told my gf to go the school cause I thought  they would help her and thought the therapists would help too but I was  wrong but I know that she wants to continue to give them another chance  and fix it through family therapy so she's currently talking with a  family therapist but things are only getting worse for her. She came to  visit me a few weeks ago, and she expressed how she did not want to go  back to that environment, and if I could have kept her here I would  have. Her living situation is so bad that she doesn't want to come home  most days. Her parents took her bedroom door off its hinges before  thanksgiving last year just for having a lock on it, and she has been  living with a shower curtain as a replacement. Yet her parents continue  to walk into her room while she is getting dressed and disrespect her  privacy constantly by taking her things or going into her room just for  the fun of it. Her parents put a lock on the basement door, which leads  to the pantry, She was making food for herself as she wants to be more  independent and responsible. Her parents have also locked up the pots  and pans, and whenever she needs either food or pots/pans, she needs to  ask them for a key, in which they look at her as she gets what she needs  to feed herself (and she finds this very creepy). Two therapists have  tried to help, but one stuck to her parent's side and the other didn't  help at all. She currently is in family therapy as she wants to have a  healthy relationship with her parents, but her parents sit there and lie  to this therapist and her dad doesn't give direct answers as to why he  does the things he does. Is there any advice as to how I can handle  this? I would love for her to move down with me to California and get  away from that but we both don't have money and she doesn't have both  her birth certificate and her social security. She is also selling  clothes to make it by and I am saving up as much money as I can to help  out too. Any advice on what to do would be much appreciated. Thank You!\n\nTldr;  Girlfriend's parents are controlling her and spreading rumors about her  as well locking up food and pot and pans and turning off internet every  night.",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": "Sorry in advance for the long post. \nMy son is almost 10, his Bio Father hasn’t been in his life since he was 12 months old. When we were together I was trying to force the relationship to work because I was only 18/19, afraid to leave. He would leave me and the baby for days at a time to go on drug binges. He would refuse to answer calls or texts, days would go by before he would come home and be completely strung out. He mentally abused me. He would break up items in our home. I was put through so much trauma and I’m just glad my son was too small to remember any of it. \nI finally left when he came home after being gone for a couple days, he was being really argumentative, yelling and scaring my 5 year old cousin who was with me at the time so when he walked outside I locked the door he came running up to the door yelling trying to kick it in I said I’m gonna go to my parents. As soon as I said that he called his drug dealer friend who he always hung out with and had him pick him up. I lived with my parents for 3 years after leaving, only hearing from him maybe once through a message on Facebook. \nThen my boyfriend and I moved into our first townhome just 10 minutes away from my parents. \nNot really hearing anything from him still I think he may have messaged me once more throughout the 2 years we lived in the townhome. Then my boyfriend and I bought our first home and have lived here for 2 years. We have three kids together, my son looks at him like he’s his Dad he doesn’t know anything else, he’s been there since he was 3 years old and has done everything for him. \n\nMeanwhile bio Dad is committing crime after crime, addicted to drugs and even moved to another state in 2020 (I didn’t find this out until yesterday). With really no care in the world for my son or his well-being. Which was fine by me because my son had such a stable, good life. \n\nOut of no where we received conciliation papers earlier this month. He was requesting joint custody, telephone calls and reunification therapy. He claims he’s an over the road truck driver using his Father’s address for mailing purposes. So I’m assuming he doesn’t actually have anywhere he lives. \nWe had conciliation yesterday and here’s how it went:\n\nFacing him after so many years even though it was through zoom was really hard. I was shaking the whole time. \nHe seemed high during the call, he would look like he would start closing his eyes and then when someone asked him a question he would say “what was that? I’m trying to focus.” He was taking the call in his work truck jumping from seat to seat. He would be sitting in the back, then go to the front and sit, then to the back. That went on during the whole call, I can’t believe the conciliator didn’t ask why he was moving around so much. \nHe admitted to being on heroin. My lawyer asked his sobriety date he said “I can’t remember.” \nHe says he moved to another state in 2020,\nHe didn’t mention my son once, never expressed that he was worried about him, that he thinks about him. Nothing. It was more him trying to make the conciliator feel bad for him and he had lots of excuses the whole time it was “me, me, me”. \n\nThere was plenty of time for him to go to court and file custody before, he was absent because he clearly was an addict, committing crimes and his own doing and I just felt like they were trying to say he wasn’t around and that was my fault? All I’ve done is try to be a good Mom, give my son a good, stable life. He’s never had to worry about any kind of drug issues with any of us, I have never committed a single crime. Idk why it felt like I was being painted as being in the wrong. \n\nUltimately it was only about a 10 minute call. No one really asked me anything other than where me and my son Have lived which I explained my parents for 3 years, the townhome 10 minutes from them and then in our current home for 2 years. Then the conciliator said I’m going to put in that reunification therapy should start. \nDidn’t ask me if I agree or anything like I thought it would go? \nThen when we were all getting ready to hang up bio dad throws up the peace sign.. 🤦🏻‍♀️ \n\nI’m still in shock. I cried a lot yesterday. I worry so much about my kids and I feel like this is just being taken out of my hands and left up to strangers based on a 10 minute call. I feel really down and hopeless and just terrible for my son. ",

        "Text": "I think it's finally over and I keep second guessing and questioning what happened. It ended a few days ago, I broke up and blocked him and I've been hurting so much. I finally tried calling him today but he blocked me and won't respond. This is the overall timeline, please help me understand:\n\n- We were in a situationship for a year where we never spoke about exclusivity but he would mention that didn't like seeing multiple people at the same time personally. I was still seeing other people casually. \n\n- I also previously engaged in sex work, including at the time we were casual. He found out and also blamed me for not being loyal to him to which I said we weren't in a relationship. He then proposed a relationship and I accepted it but for the next two months he'd constantly slutshame me for hours everyday and even in public sometimes, and then tell me to get naked and have sex. He'd scream at me for hours at an end verbally abusing me and I was isolated from everyone else at this point of time.\n\n- He'd constantly convince me that I was lying, even if I wasn't. He'd tell me that I've been raped and been taken advantage of multiple times when drunk and because I've had at least two instances of this actually happening (with people I know) and I always had flashes of the memories and it made sense logically, also because I did sometimes drink heavily (always with friends I trusted). He used the fact that I didn't remember all the specifics all the time to convince me and sometimes it made no sense because there were things I definitely had memory of and confirmed with my friends that he's convince me were otherwise.\n\n- This whole thing went on for about 3 months and culminated in him abusing me again in public near my house, dragging me crying, calling me names and pushing me in front of my friend telling he that he wants nothing to do with me.\n\n- After this it all came to me at once, I left town, went to my parents', I was miserable for a month but I still missed him so much, I blocked him but went back the minute he called from another number.\n\n- The next two months he never raged or abused me and changed in a lot of ways and was very nice and caring but I wasn't mentally prepared to move past it all and was still scared it would happen again. He kept convincing me to give it a chance and I kept avoiding it and reluctantly giving in. The only few issues now were him constantly wanting to know where I was and not hiding us from my friends (who don't like him for obvious reasons), and whenever we had a disagreement it would turn into him, in a calm voice, following this pattern of being disappointed, blaming me, convincing me everything was okay and it would go on for hours, all night. \n\n- he was telling me that I was running without giving it a chance and I just felt trapped again and I blocked him.\n\n- he was already pretty worn down by everything and I think this has now offended him and hurt his ego. In a normal relationship I would understand that this kind of back and forth and constant breaking up would be hurtful to anybody and I wouldn't blame him to want to move on but a huge part of me wonders, was I just so fixated on the idea of him being a narc and never changing that I didn't even give him a chance? I feel very guilty for not giving it a real chance. He did show change and he is the kind of person that keeps his word once he promises stuff. Also never cheated. Was he ever a narc or just someone who reacted badly due to the circumstances? ",

        "Text": "****Long post incoming (apologies)****\n\nAfter extensive research and reading stories here, I(34F) am convinced that the “nice guy”(37M) I gave a chance to was a narcissist. However, I do want some things clarified as I haven’t seen his particular behaviors written about and I’m still confused. \nSome back story: I have known this man for over a decade. He is fairly beloved in our community and is known as a “sweet heart”. He has always had a crush on me and I decided last year to finally give him a chance. He was in an “open relationship” (though I have my doubts of the validity of the openness now), and frequently told me how his girlfriend said the most cruel things to him and would “go red”, how she was constantly putting him down. I felt so horrible and told him how he absolutely did not deserve that and how it breaks my heart that she could be so heartless. He definitely pit us against one another and after they broke up, he would go out with her (I knew because of how many people wanted to clarify that he and I were seeing each other because they kept seeing him out at bars with her, and he never told me when he was doing this)…he would borrow her car for days on end (oh yeah, he didn’t have a job…he had one when we got together and then when he lost it, he wasn’t interested in finding a new one unless it was to his exact specifications), etc. I tried to set boundaries with him and if we were talking on the phone, he would start shouting about how jealous I was and then he would hang up. Mind you, I never raised my voice when telling him that the closeness of their relationship made me uncomfortable…I never asked him to cut off contact with her..I just asked that he be open with me about this, to which it was like a switch was flipped and he would just start yelling at me before hanging up. He would also eat all of my food…I would go to grocery store Monday night and spend $100 on food, and get home from work Tuesday afternoon and it would be gone (I mentioned this to him, and even bought food I knew he disliked, and it would still be gone), he would fat shame me, critiqued the sound of me peeing (I’m not kidding..), make back handed comments about how my apartment looked…among many other things that hurt me. \nNow for the behavior that has me so confused still…if we were together in person, he had this habit of starting to sob (tomato red face, tears), and would make sure he was positioned higher than me and would shove his finger in my face while calling me a bully. The first time it happened was in the middle of the night and I rolled over, and I guess made a noise he didn’t like? He immediately got up, ran over to my side of the bed, pointed his finger in my face and started screaming at me…I was so confused and asked what I had done and he kept screaming “YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID!” and said that the fact that I didn’t know was a sign that I was manipulating him. Every time he started screaming and sobbing out of nowhere, I begged him to tell me what I did so I could fix it..and he never had an answer. He would ask me questions during these tantrums and if I responded I was “cutting him off” and if I didn’t (because I was too scared to cut him off), I was ignoring him and didn’t care. He also went from zero to SCREAMING out of nowhere. I have done a lot of work on myself, and have a habit of not raising my voice if arguments happen…I try my best to hear what the other person is saying and want to respond as calmly and concisely as I can. He would tell me that I had gone from “shouting” to “whispering” to make him feel “crazy”…I know for a fact that I only raised my voice maybe twice and it was when he had gotten so loud that I was scared the cops would be called. He always blamed me for his screaming, he would also say that his mom always cried to make him understand things and that’s why he did it. I also remember the first time I asked him a deeper question about his feelings and he clammed up and blamed it on autism (I found out he has never been diagnosed with autism) and said that when he’s working in public he is “masking” and because of his autism, he physically could not put his feelings into words.\nI haven’t heard about other stories of narcissists sobbing. He and I did not last long as I think he realized I wasn’t going to put up with his abuse. When I told him he was projecting, I have never seen anyone blow up the way he did. I also told him I thought he could be verbally abusive with me, and he responded by going from zero to 100 “YOU’RE VERBALLY ABUSING ME! YOU’RE THE KOST ABUSIVE AND MANIPULATIVE PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!”   The last time I saw him, he had made my friends cry that night and had flirted with a bunch of women in front of me and I finally started crying and he laughed in my face. When I took him home, he got out of my car screaming at me that I was a bully, that he loved me, that I was an abuser, that he loved me. He eventually screamed at me (while I was in my car in the street) to “get the f*ck off his property” and I laughed at that, because he hasn’t paid rent in 15 years—has mooched off of girlfriends, and at the time of this story, was living with our mutual friend rent free (I found out our mutual friend ended up kicking him out because I guess he started abusing him as well and my friend got incredibly depressed…nex is now living with his mother). \nHe had ten years to get to know me and my insecurities, trauma, and mental illness—and I swear, he remembered it all and used it against me. I know this was a long post, and I’m honestly not even scratching the surface. I guess I want to know if anyone has experienced the sobbing/screaming (Sidenote: he never cried when he thought he might be losing me…I think maybe he was still getting supply from his ex so he didn’t care so much? Thoughts??) with covert narcissists? This has messed me up so badly in the head and, because I knew him as the kind-sweet-marriage material guy, I never could have imagined that that person just straight up doesn’t exist. I am still so confused and often wonder if I am the abuser he accused me of being? \nSorry for the long post…I haven’t seen anyone else mention this particular type of crying from a nex …can anyone relate? Just trying to feel less alone!  Thank you!",

If one of you disrespects the other in some fashion, seriously or repeatedly, such as by breaking clear boundaries or breaking them more than once after discussion, it's a good thing. \n\nThis is an especially important message for anyone who has one or more chronic illnesses or currently provides caregiving to someone. People with chronic illnesses are often socially frail. They can't afford to lose friends and often hold onto relationships long after it's healthy for them to do so because they feel isolated or see some continued benefit, often one that's maybe unhealthy for them and the other person as well. They might even be holding on because of fear of worse harm by letting go (i.e., when dealing with an abuser, for example, they might fear retaliation, harassment and other continued abuse).\n\nMany people, both with chronic illnesses and without, can't have strong relationships because they're not physically, mentally, emotionally or often financially and career-wise on equal footing to their peers or anyone else in their lives. They're often targeted by people in society who like to feel needed or like heroes and predators who like the power and control they can have over others.\n\nFor someone in this type of situation to end a relationship, it's often because they're feeling more isolated and alone, possibly abused or some other \"pain\" point that they might have spoken up about and even ended the relationship over much sooner had they just been healthier or much more stable in terms of their social circle status, work and finances or other areas. But they held on because the isolation and loneliness makes any morsel of compassion and care, or interest in their lives, seem like the most wonderful thing. Perhaps they held on for some other benefit beyond the social one.\n\nIf someone who this post applies to ends a relationship, then it's pretty telling and should be a cause for concern. It should not be a reason to disrespect them by blowing up their phone, socials, etc. trying to find out more about the \"why\" when they've already given their reason to the extent that their willing.\n\nAnd to anyone who has ended a relationship or feels the need to while experiencing any of the above: Self-care is NOT selfish.",

I'd just been through one of the happiest periods of my life, and I had a very positive energy. I introduced myself to each teacher, talked to them, and was excited to get to know everybody.\n\nI went up to the narcissist to say hi, and he ignored me. He acted like I wasn't worth his time, even though we'd never met, and I actually have a lot more experience and education than him. That was discouraging. Then, at meetings I heard him whispering about me to people.\n\nOne by one, teachers who'd previously smiled at me, talked to me and were kind, stopped. Suddenly people would respond to me with one word answers, and they wouldn't make eye contact with me. Eventually I got to the point where the only people who would talk to me were the cleaning staff. I'm very grateful to the cleaning staff for socializing with me and developing friendships with me, and my only guess as to why he didn't try to turn them against me is that the teachers tend to act like they're above the cleaning staff.\n\nI need tables for the students in order to teach my lessons. This narcissist told a guy to take the tables. I asked if he could take a different table since I needed mine for the lessons, but the guy insisted, so I actually helped him move a table. When we delivered the tables to where the narcissist was, he and the guy he'd sent started giggling at me for helping them. This is incredibly childish, but it made me very sad they were putting me in this position.\n\nI'm moving to a different school because of this. It sucks because I've become extremely close with the people I'm living with, and to move to the other school I'm going to need to change housing. It sucks that my work life was destroyed by one petty person. I've gone from being happy and optimistic, to being sad all the time. In a depression assessment, I scored very high. I don't want to do anything. I just lay around all the time. I always feel sad. I'd had thoughts of self-harm. I'm nervous about the future, I have no confidence, and I stay in because I don't want my friends to see how timid and miserable I am right now. I absolutely hate that a petty, nasty, small person has been able to affect me this much. I feel like everything I do is wrong, and I feel like a pariah.\n\nI know this is different from many of the posts here, from people who were in intimate relationships with narcissists, where they were part of the narcissists' in-group. I've experienced being in the narcissist's out-group - he devalued and attacked me to make him feel superior, in a childish bullying campaign. I hate that I'm in this situation.",

He's much younger than me and we hardly know each other - after now having met the second time and I did ask him if this is the usual way he dates women and he said no. He mentioned it just feels so comfortable with me \n\nThis could be an odd coincidence as my nex wasn't my type and I feel it was more his manipulative interaction I fell for, while this guy also isn't my type but makes me feel good kind of as if I'm having a high trip again. \n\nI'm just not sure if I'm over thinking this \n\nI'm just not the person to hold hands so quick and need a bit of \"warming up\"",

        "Text": "For some context. My stepdaughter and her husband had agreed to meet her mother for Christmas eve. The day before,  the 23rd, the mother starts messaging asking aggressively if she is coming, telling her how much she has done for her. My stepdaughter doesn't hear the messages because she is at a noisy birthday lunch for a friend. When she sees the messages she apologises and tells her mother that she will call her when the lunch is over, explaining that it's very loud where she is. Mother responds telling her not to come to lunch on Christmas eve and that her heart is broken. Sheesh.\nChristmas eve comes around, stepson goes to lunch with the mother and she tells him a bunch of lies implicating son in law, who apparently demanded that he be able to bring his mother to the lunch as her partner has covid. Not true. So mother also tells stepson that son in laws mother lives with partner, which she doesn't and that he wanted to bring her and possibly infect elderly grandparents.\nChristmas night it starts, stepson is hyped up on vodka redbulls and starts messaging son in law disgusting, threatening messages on theirpersonalaccounts. Son in law sensibly blocks him and so does my stepdaughter. So that line is closed down. He then comes after my husband threatening and accusing him of letting/encouraging them to hurt his mother. He also tells his father that he hates that he is his father and if he sees him he will kill him.\nWe thought it was over until on a Wednesday night, a night stepson goes to his mother's for dinner, it started again and it's scary, husband has now blocked him. My stepdaughter and her husband have an online business and he has started with the revolting threats and truly disgusting comments again on the businessaccounts.\nWe don't know what to do, we don't think he will try to physically hurt anybody but who knows. We really don't want to go to the police because it would really affect his life, he could lose everything and that could make things worse.\nWe are in Australia, FYI.",

Both my “stepmom” and my dad were supposed to get me there. I asked why she was following me and she said that I was being too slow and that I should speed up to accommodate for others, but I have a lifelong and complicated incurable heart condition that makes me very exhausted all the time, so I can’t force myself to speed up even if I wanted to and she knows this. I shouted that she should stop treating me like a child (I’m 28 but still live with my dad due to my condition) but she just got really angry. Before that accident she was very lovey dovey and wanted to hug me all the time and I said no because of my autism, I can’t handle hugs from people unexpectedly. I guess she followed me to snoop on me. And she always does stuff without asking, she just goes into my room and starts doing things, sometimes she takes stuff and puts them somewhere else without asking. She keeps copying me, when I’m taking pictures of nature when we are walking the dogs she does the same. She also tries to get up at the same time as me, so every time I’m up in the morning no matter what time, she is always there asking me what I’m getting for breakfast etc. \n\nShe is also drinking and my dad used to have a drinking problem. He was once hospitalized before due to the drinking and while she was visiting to help me, she decided to have a drink and get drunk, which is very selfish to do considering what I was going through. She is completely out of reach when she is drunk and it is impossible to talk to her without upsetting her, also she can’t take any criticism in general. \n\nWhen she knows I’m right during arguments she just shuts down or gets really upset and angry, and tries to justify the reasons why she is doing dumb things. When I tell her to stop doing things that upset me she just continues and never changes. She doesn’t take my weight loss and heart problems seriously either, she keeps saying calories isn’t important and keeps buying me and my dad unhealthy stuff and she gets upset when I’m not eating the food. I have to keep my weight healthy due to my heart condition. I keep asking her to stop smoking inside because it is harmful for my heart but she just keeps smoking near me. And then she gets angry and denies the risks of my condition completely. And due to my heart condition I can’t just move out easily, I need proper accommodation and also helpers to help me out. So that’s why I still live with my dad. \n\nIs it possible she could be a narcissist?",

I feel like I have been discarded and want to go back, counseling and therapy help me see otherwise. But I get moments that are low and I want to just be ok again, I want to be ok with the betrayal and look the other way. I can’t unsee what I have already seen, what is done is done. So why am I having the hardest time pushing through those feelings? Why to I want to be ok with it? Why is this happening? I feel like I was to the point I almost lost my sanity, I do not know who I am except the man she wanted me to be and yet that wasn’t enough. Sometimes it feels as if this was the nightmare, she was a covert narcissist who played the victim and still tried to blame the cheating on me, but she didn’t cheat she was faithful the whole 10 years. She loved me but still does but can’t because she is not in love with me, the lies are what makes it 10 times worse it makes it harder to hold on to reality. I find myself wanting it all back but when I write it all down I want what she couldn’t give me or the lie she sold to me. I wanted the nuclear family, the loving wife, the white picket fence, all of what we talked about until even on dday. My world shattered into a million pieces and now I am trying to hurry to put the pieces back together while holding on to reality and seeing all the little pieces and things that didn’t add up to see how messed up the big picture really was. So how after saying all that do I want to go back? Why does my everything want to go against my self, I fight with myself everyday to not make the wrong decisions and sometimes I forget what side I am on. \n\nJust venting, missing, wanting, wishing, being alone will try and trick me that it wasn’t so bad that I could forget and look the other way. Why do that? How can I? I feel like if I hit rock bottom and want to go to my comfort zone, the place, the only place I felt happy. It’s funny that I seek happiness and comfort from the place that brought be the pain and suffering that I seek comfort from.",

        "Upvotes": 2,
        "Text": " \n\nI (F27) recently gone no contact with this person (F35) who we’ll call Abby. As I’m putting the pieces together, I’m seeing patterns of behavior and wondering if I’m dealing with a narcissist or a crappy friend. Not sure why it matters to me so much, but it would bring some clarity and validity to what I’ve experienced.  \n\n\\*TLDR: I ignored all my intuition and red flags for 10 years and I’m wondering if the emotional abuse and spiritual manipulation is narcissism or just a bad friend. \\*\n\nAbby and I met back in 2014 in Bible college. She and her husband lived on campus, I was a young, 17 year old freshman. She became a mentor to me, and offered some really harmful advice/direction to me under the guise of Christianity around sex, marriage, and faith. Even going so far as to say I needed to break up with my boyfriend (now husband) because I was “idolizing” him. At the time I didn’t realize how harmful it was and because she was so much older/ more experienced, I accepted everything she said as gospel. \n\nI had a warning from another woman I deeply respected saying that I should be wary of Abby and her husband. I thought that was odd, but didn’t know what was up. \n\nAfter college, my husband and I get married and Abby’s daughter and son are our flower girl and ring bearer. We then move overseas and lose contact with Abby. \n\nFast forward to 2021, we end up in the same city. She offers to reconnect, and I am wary, since I’ve deconstructed some and seen some of the red flags of her behavior/beliefs. I’m not interested in a mentorship, but we visit. Her marriage is in a weird spot, she starts oversharing about their struggles, and mentions she’s recently learned her mom is a narcissist and has gone no contact with her. There was a weird interaction here where she offers a contact for a free crib. Due to a misunderstanding she says to me “I was hoping you could contact the friend like a grown up”. Then I told Abby I didn’t want the crib anymore, and she acted offended but I didn’t really care. I just wanted out of the awkward situation. \n\nSadly Abby’s husband passed away from depression about 6 months later. \n\nWe were told that her whole church community ousted them, and since she had no family support, she was alone with her four kids.\n\nWe weren’t super close at the time but she made it seem like we were so important to her husband so we attended the graveside and brought her a meal. \n\nA few months later and she calls me crying saying she needs someone to take her to urgent care because she has Covid and no one will help her. I felt badly for her and I dragged my newborn out with me to drive her around, while my husband and other child watched her children. \n\nFrom then on, we made regular efforts to help her and her family. She would eat up my time with hours long phone calls and daily texting. I was also going through a rough time, newly postpartum, absolutely debilitating postpartum depression, living away from family, in a new area, and also newly diagnosed with ADHD. I feel we bonded over this. \n\nHere is a summary with examples of the subtle abuse that went on over the next 18 months. At the time I dismissed it, insisting she was going through a rough time.\n\n* Superiority: She made me feel like she was a better parent, housekeeper, a better wife, (even though she wasn’t a wife anymore), and Christian. \n* Spiritual manipulation: she would always make it seem like she was so much more spiritually mature than I was, that her therapist was more biblically grounded, that her parenting was more biblical, etc…. \n* Gaslighting: She would expect me to do things for her that I hadn’t agreed to. And when I expressed discomfort with the idea, she acted all high and mighty that of course she would never expect me to, though she did. When I did question her questionable choices, (bad boyfriends, reckless driving, refusal to take her prescribed pain meds, reckless spending), she would say that’s not what happened, I’m remembering it wrong etc.\n* Emotional overstepping: when I was going through a nervous breakdown she called my husband and told him what to do for me. She encouraged me to come to her house if I ever needed a night away from my husband. Got pissed when I didn’t call her back immediately when I was crying and talking things out with my husband. Told me once that everyone at a party thought my husband was an asshole but that she set everyone straight. Really didn’t like my husband for some reason. \n* Hero/victim mentality: she had the most toxic boyfriends, therapists, had drama with so many friends, and was the victim or hero in every story. She could do no wrong because she was a disabled widow, and a single mother of 4. On Facebook she had this put together perfect grieving widow persona, but was a hot mess IRL. She would tell me over text that she’s in 10/10 pain, but then be posting on Facebook about how she is baking bread from scratch and is doing all these things. \n* Love bombing: she knew we were not well off money wise, and she would buy stuff for my kids (which I expressed discomfort with but never drew a boundary), gave us her old piano, would get me coffee, order food in, gave me her old clothes, took me on a shopping spree when I was having my mental breakdown. She helped me find a therapist and funded my psychologist visits. \n\nThe breaking point: \n\nAfter I got in therapy and started saying all of this stuff out loud, I realized I’ve never pushed back when she low key insulted me or hurt my feelings, even though I apologized frequently. I texted her saying the most recent interaction that left me feeling crappy about myself, and I wished she would have encouraged me instead. She sent a multi paragraph text gaslighting me, saying I was being too emotional, spiritually taking high ground by saying she was “praying for me” and took no responsibility for how she hurt me. \n\nFor some reason that little interaction snapped something in me and I realized I was done. Her mask fell and I saw a glimpse of what our friendship really was. I sent her a text a week later and said I was done with the friendship.   \n\n\nHer response? \"I wish you the very best. I'm not able to give you everything you want, and boundaries seem really tough for you right now. I'll be praying for your healing. Love you so much\"  \n\n\nFurther proving that she had no intention of ever taking accountability or saying sorry. Just making it my issue for wanting too much.\n\nTLDR: I ignored all my intuition and red flags for 10 years and I’m wondering if the emotional abuse and spiritual manipulation is narcissism or just a bad friend.

I’ve been talking to this man for 2.5 years now. From the day that I met him, he told me he doesn’t want a relationship and he has stuck to that. I think I have an anxious attachment style, and him saying this made me work harder to show him I’m worth it.\n\nFast forward to now, and we got in an accident and he lost his car. I’m not taking him to work every day and have been living with him for 4 months.\n\nHe’s very rough when he plays with me and I’m always telling him he’s hurting me. He is constantly calling me sensitive and annoying and saying this is why he can’t play with me. Recently he’s been getting nastier with his words and will call me a bitch, whore, slut, in a very casual and joking way. And every time I tell him to watch how he talks to me or return his behavior, he gets very rough and holds me down or covers my mouth or puts his hand around my throat and tells me to say sorry (he’s doing it in a joking way, it sounds more aggressive than it is. He is EXTREMELY playful and it’s annoying as FUCK). Or sometimes he’ll lightly play slap my face because I’m “disrespecting him”. When I call him out he always says you can’t disrespect me and expect nothing to happen.. he does this when I say things like stfu or call him slow because he intentionally misunderstands me. \n\nThe other night we were showering together and he was being aggravating the entire time, and I went past him aggressively because we were switching who’s under the water, and I ended up pushing him a little bit. He didn’t like that and he pushed me back. I didn’t like that so I tore open the shower curtain, lunged out of the shower, and threw my rag which accidentally hit him in his face, filled with soap and water 😅. I just wanted to get out of the shower with him because he was doing too much. Right after this he got out the shower aggressively and was saying “really? Really?” And held my throat and pushed me against the wall so I can look at him in his face that now had soap all over it. I told him to calm down (because he was EXTREMELY angry. His face looked different.) He then rubbed his hand with soap all on my face, then got back in the shower. I dried off and was silently crying. I slept on the couch. The next night when we got home from work, we didn’t talk. I fell asleep on the couch again and he came and got me. He asked me “so are you going to apologize or what?” And basically was saying he saw nothing wrong with what he did because I was aggressive and disrespectful first, so I can’t find fault in what he did. He didn’t like that I told him to calm down either, and I explained it felt like he was going to hit me. He caught immediate offense and said “you think I’d hit you?? You’re not even WORTH hitting to me. That would completely ruin my life. The fact you think I’d hit you is crazy. You’ve never even seen me mad. I’ve never even punched a wall around you or anything. If you think I’ll hit you then leave wtf? Why are you still here?”\n\nThe whole situation has me confused and conflicted. He didn’t grow up with a dad to teach him how to treat women, and he has an abusive ex that used to hit him and spit on him and said he now doesn’t accept disrespect because she took it too far when he’d let her hit him.\n\nI mentioned what happened to my sisters (who already hate him) and they immediately grew worries and are now telling me he’s going to hit me and I’m living in a false reality. I love him so much and in a city where I know nobody but him. I don’t want to lose him, but also don’t know how to feel. I can’t imagine a life without him. They say I’m defending him and justifying his actions, but what he did was crazy and abuse… I feel like we both play a part, but idk if I’m protecting him or playing down the situation. ",

I was usually buying the sage and just idk being spiritual with my perspective on life and everything. Just recently before our breakup he started buying sage and just burning it and now today he’s participating in Lent?? When I asked him why he just started explaining what lent was… I know what lent is like huh. I’m like why are you doing this… he’s says “I wanna give up meat with spines and just eat fish like a pescatarian, it’ll be a good cleanse and discipline” I’m not sure if I’m just hyper aware but ever since finding out he might be a narc, it just smells phony to me. He cheated on me in December, I had overreacted because he wouldn’t communicate with me about it so he painted me as the abuser in the relationship. Now he’s being nice to me? Telling me all the things he wanna accomplish. I feel like it’s bull and he’s just putting on this mask. “Nice guy, spiritual guy, church guy” it’s all a mask because his level of action doesn’t match his words. I’ve tried inspiring him but he either took it as an attack or just doesn’t listen. Just wanted to vent I guess. ",

So there is full understanding that this relationship is over. This is after he flipped everything around on me and made me out to be an abuser in front of his family and friends. He’s been acting “nice” to me like still asking to be cordial with each other w.e. So I made myself some porridge and specifically put a boundary up that I don’t want him touching it. He tried to joke around it and was like “watch it’s gonna be gone when you come home blah blah”, I ignored him. I learned that everything is always a joke with him, so I can imagine him now defending it like it’s just a joke but obviously it wasn’t because shortly after the “joke” he asks me “ hey i really would like some of your breakfast” I just replied no but I’d gladly make you some . He obviously seemed offended and said no, It’s okay. I feel like he’s freaking playing in my face, trying to see if he can keep crossing boundaries and I hate this because I get left feeling like I’m a bad person. But no I stood my ground because I’ve been loving just putting boundaries on things. It protects my energy. Then I feel bad because I used some of his stuff to make the breakfast but then I’m like dude I offered and you didn’t want none. Urgh the rollercoaster is crazy. Can’t wait to leave honestly because it’s like when he doesn’t get his way he’s like a child. Like not saying bye when he leaves but I really shouldn’t give a damn. ",

However, some of the people were brought by the narc, and were his friends who he has known for a long time. \n\nBesides all of them being incompetent and in some way deranged as well, a trend we noticed in all of them is that they will defend the narc's actions no matter what, will justify his violence and everything he does, and view him as a force of nature. They are also all much \"softer\" people than the narc, who has a very harsh and callous personality. They act as human shields for the things he does.\n\nIt is normal for narcs to form this \"web\" of people around them?\n\nAnd is there any better way to deal with these people?\n\nThank you for reading and for your time.",

Here's mine. \n\n1. Didn't trust me\n2. Accused me of cheating, being secretly gay, on drugs, murdering kitties that were killed by a dog, of not even wanting her, of me and my mom being more, her mom and I being a thing, pretty much most of everyone in my life being a thing \n3. Very Insecure and Jealous and Possessive towards me, could text her ex's and guys but I didn't and couldn't even speak to a girl, things were very one sided \n4. Controlling - Stopped having a life because of her trust issues and assumptions - Neglected family, friends, my job and hobbies because of it. Couldn't take a shower before going somewhere or deciding to throw jeans on when I was going out without her. Questioned me for wanting to go visit my dads at night. I would send her pictures just to prove I was where I was\n5. Nitpicked me too and gave so much constructive criticism\n6. Made it feel that no matter what I did it wasn't ever good enough and like I could never do right\n7. Cheated on me, didn't come home until two in the morning and threw it in my face how he makes money and at least he spoils me, said they only kissed once and cuddled a little bit, essentially we got into it  before I even knew she did and she then proceeded to walk up to me and grab me extremely hard by the wrists with my arms pulled back and asked me \"What I wanted from her?\", I got up very lightly touched her arms to go around her trying to hold my composure, this is when the cheating accusations got worse before she confessed which was a day or two later with the cuddling part and then like three months with the kiss. \n8. Was hard on me for struggling financially even though I was providing for the both of us and trying to keep up with a car payment \n9. She wouldn't keep a job \n10. Compared me to her ex's \n11. Didn't like any of my friends and family and said bad things about them after a while \n12. Shit on my taste in music even though I never did hers\n13. Used sex as a weapon/power: Was very hard on me, impatient and even snapped at me when I was first inexperienced with sex and would threaten to leave me or fuck someone else, threw things even if I didn't get stuff down which I did get down eventually, once told me how I was never fucking touching her again, made me feel stupid and treated me like I was when I was learning and put me down and compared me to her ex's. I remember one time her turning over in disappointment and just how rejected and humiliated I felt. Her pulling me off when she was disappointed at times, a few occasions of her wiping the cum out of her. Made me feel guilty about these things too saying she felt like she was being used even though I was trying my best to learn and become the best for her. Of course the sex and everything got better, hell amazing, but still, learning you don't treat your significant other like this. \n14. Punched me over false accusations - got pushed and fell over the bed raising one of my arms to then get punched three times hit at my side, I got up and yelled what the fuck and grabbed her by the shirt and got in her face and defended my case again some more. It was over the fact that she thought I was using her toy when I was not. \n15. Pushed and shoved me a few times over false accusations\n16. interrogated me most days and threatened my security with us \n17. Triangulation and Smear Campaigned - Vented to her ex's about me - The relationship got so stressful and she moved out once before on top of that, I was also under so much pressure, so I eventually started having erection problems, I felt ashamed as is and she was extremely hard on me for it and even told her ex's and made her accuse me even more of being gay and not wanting her, but the truth is I felt worthless and powerless and my confidence with us and self esteem was at an all time low. Eventually the ED problems subsided though and we fucked a million times more. Worst of all she threatened our relationship out of it making the situation at the time even more stressful and pressuring plus her bringing it up a lot didn't help\nGave dudes and ex's the impression that I'm secretly gay and or on drugs, by the end of the relationship goes around still stating that on top of me being the abusive one. \n18. Went back and forth with us, always tried to push me away, rejected me when she thought I did something that I did not do / Affectionate and sweet ASF and attentive one moment and then the next cold and distant and rejecting \n19. Inconsiderate of my feelings and some times would say I was being dramatic or that I was too sensitive \n20. Moved out and in twice and moved out final the third time \n21. Tried to fight my friend/roommate that she thought and assumed I was fucking when I was not, me and my roommate stopped talking when at home and rarely if ever hung out anymore. Eventually he moved out which just made things harder for me and my mom financially. \n22. Tried to make me feel less of a man, always stated how I acted feminine and some how had things about me that insinuated I was gay and stating how my body size is small, wanting me to gain more weight, said I'd be perfect for gay men as I'm petite like. Even called me pussy a few times, I know at once did and stated how she didn't think I could protect her or her family. \n23. Pushed me down on the bed and held me down for a second and slapped me across the face\n24. Couldn't mess with my nose or make noise with it without being ridiculed and harassed for being a drug user literally almost every time to the point I started watching me clearing my sinus' and coughing a lot even after once incident of me crying\n25. Did not understand my shy bladder and gave me so much shit about it, most times I went in the bathroom I'd be accused of doing drugs in there or having an affair with my roommate, same when I just took showers alone. She'd get annoyed if I went somewhere private or wanting to use the bathroom alone, but again I have a extremely difficult time peeing in front of people. I have a sensitive bladder as well and some times would go before falling a sleep, some times twice, but I remember being scared to wake her or even go as it'd often result in me being questioned and accused of drug use or her just getting annoyed with me, it got to a point that many times I'd just leave the door open so she could hear I was peeing and times I'd even empty out all my pockets to show that I have no drugs on me. \n26. Wanting to know where my money went, some how didn't seem to get or understand why I just might struggle financially keeping up with a car payment and other smaller bills all the while having to provide for her too. Took a receipt before of my money withdrawn and asked about it which I of course had an answer but later on mentioned it again and I done forgot at this point what I spent it all on. \n27. Didn't respect me, believe me or believe in me, had much of any faith in me \n28. Did not support me being in a band, said it was lame and shit on my band members, accused of me and my vocalist being a thing, made fun of her weight and called me a whore and did this all because I just went over there to get a tattoo done, a tattoo?! Treated me like I was dumb too and like I couldn't make decisions for myself. And wouldn't see her after the last time she laid hands on me and I only said maybe I would. \n29. Manipulated and Guilt Tripped me, would say things like if I loved her or wanted her I'd do this or that or wouldn't do this or that, she would have done this or that. Would cry at times because of her past and the way she is but got worse is the thing, didn't actually really try getting better for us. \n30. Always wanted more no matter how much I gave or offered \n31. Checked my body often and would think I was getting it on with somebody else when I was not, such as hickeys she gave me and scratches I got from my job from Springing Up frames which is one of the most physically demanding jobs \n32. Always looked to see if my eyes were bloodshot and when they were would accuse me of using, of being on Coke when the most intense drug I've ever tried was Acid and I already past a few drug tests for her, pulled my shirt up the last time I saw her and said what's this insinuating im on drugs even though I was always skinny plus having a poor eating habit on top of that. \n33. I remember one time I came home and looked down smiling as I walked into the room as I was anxious and on edge at this point and  didn't know what to expect, what kind of person I was going to be getting, she flipped shit, pushed at me and then went outside, thought I was hiding something. Another time getting so mad over the fact a work friend that happened to be a girl wanted a ride home, I said yes but ended up saying no In the end as I didn't think it'd be right and somehow still got tormented and guilt tripped the fuck out of for and worst of all my security with us threatened the fuck out of. A girl that I never even kissed and had the tiniest fling with and also was way before we even dated. We argued and at some point she kept pushing at me wanting me to fight her, obviously I didn't budge. \n34. Punched at my side / arm area two occasions out of anger and pulled my hair with both hands one of those occasions \n35. Would make insulting hurtful jabs at me when she was mad and accusing, such as telling me to go hop on a dick, be with one of my guys friends and drug related stuff, to go do my drugs. Even when I was just hanging out with them, mentioned sucking each other like no I'm good\n36. Would some times get mad and irritable at me for not doing morning sex even though I'm always down but also need to pee first thing in the morning when I wake up and get awake. As I was working a physically demanding hard job and she was jobless so then at times all the sudden in the morning she'd get annoyed at me for it and would say mean and hurtful things towards me, put me down\n37. Would make me feel like I didn't deserve her or her love even though I try out of most people and gave it my all with us and genuinely loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. \n38. Held Grudges and never would let anything go, would throw it up in my face and bring it up, meanwhile I tend to willingly forgive her so easily and live and let live with hers. Most times, eventually I started doing it back \n39. Had to reassure her over probably a dozen millions times, explain my myself, give answers over the simplest of things, to the point it felt like I was a broken record and losing my mind. \n40. Used my snapping moments with us as a means of guilt tripping and making me feel like such a God awful human, a piece of shit. Especially when it was provoked and started from her, so often or not I'd be the one apologizing totally forgetting that she started the instigating and interrogating or whatever else in the first place. \n41. Tried to say I put others above her when really I put her above everyone including my own damn self, always gave majority of my time and attention and efforts towards her too. Literally, I'd even go out of my way during work breaks to get her a Vape or a Dab pen cartridge, would spend time with her every lunch break, rarely spent time with friends or went to my dads, most days sent a morning paragraph on my way to work, got us groceries, texted her the most, seen her the most, just you name it. \n42. At times thought I was copying her and wanted to be her\n43. Used her past hurts and or illness as an excuse for her abusive and controlling tendencies or something I said as a reason to hit me even though my explosion was being provoked and pushed out by the relationship, by her, it was too much. That and Alcohol.\n44. Would think my explanations and reasons were some times \"excuses\" when actuality they were suggestion and truth\n45. Always seem to have some kind of complaint or problem, could never seem to be happy and contempt with us or me even though I was always giving it my all day in day out, literally. \n46. Tried to prevent me from going to my friend's and family about our relationship for advice, would say how it needs to be private and between us and other times took it as me wanting to simply just go talk shit about her and make her look bad when really I wasn't. Other times said I did it for attention. I was made to feel bad for just wanting to vent to people about my relationship. Also said they all babied me. \n47. Made Physical threats \n48. When she moved out the second time at her ex's parents to take care of them she wanted me to come with her and expected me to drop and leave everything else behind, including my mom who needed me to take her to and from work instead of giving my mom time and a heads up, also my instruments. She also wanted me to consider moving in with her at her mom's as well. Made me feel bad for helping my mom. \n49. One chance I gave her we slept together two straight days and we agreed to take it slow with her love bombing me of a better relationship for us and marriage, for us to be more mature this time around and wanting to give me what I deserve only for her to then a few days later cut us off and say I deserve better and that she can't handle or put me through such a thing for life, to just block her and forget she even exists, I of course got upset as I deserved an actual chance and gave all of myself once again back to her only to get dropped. \n50. One time she wanted to spend like 80 bucks on me for stuff I needed and I said she didn't have to but she wanted to so I let her, we got home and she found out she didn't have enough money for her vape and changed her tune real quick, made me feel bad for her volunteeringly spending money on me and made me feel like I didn't even deserve such a thing, a sweet nice gesture and made me feel awful and ashamed about it. \n51. First time she moved out I was obviously devastated, decided to treat myself with my own money and got guilt tripped the fuck out of it by her. \n52. Second Time she moved out got mad at me just for consulting with my friends and drinking with them as I was devastated and needed some company. Expected me to come there and talk to her which I wanted to but thought she wanted space and some time as she even said that before she left \n53. Punched in the face or head once before\n54. Slapped in the face, grabbed by the throat, punched at and Spat at the last time I saw her which was Sunday. \n55. Suicidal Threats, one incident her talking about jumping in front of a car while we were arguing on the sidewalk on the side of the street, another one her grabbing a small blade that she took to the bathroom that I convinced her not to do, another where she opened the car door as I was driving like she was about to jump out and all I wanted to do was talk and get her to calm down, she was upset just because my ex roommate and best friend happened to be at a gas station together in her town. One discard phase she mentioned how she couldn't live without me and how she was gonna say fuck it and relapse and basically pretty much give up. \n56. Body Shamed me\n\n",

I think the school is pretty safe though so I'm not too worried about that but just pissed. She took all of my parents' money wanted to take the house too but I made sure that it got sold.

I really love her and I have loved her ever since, nonetheless our relationship has always been a mess. When we started dating she was breaking up with someone else and the first few months I thought that the problems we had derived from the issues she went through with her last relationship (she would always say that her ex was a controlling person). \n\nAs time went by I realized that she had severe trust issues as well as manipulative and control behaviors. She would constantly devalue the things I'd try to do for her and even my person saying things like she thought that I was only intelligent for school stuff but not for life, not to mention all the gaslighting scenarios we went through. I grew tired of her behavior and broke up with her when we were about year and a half in the relationship. I told her how mean she was towards me and how much control she'd try to put on me everytime. I was mad pissed at that time and it was quite easy for me to get involved with someone else at my university. She tried to convince me to get back with her and did put a lot of pressure on me everyday, I felt so guilty and lonely and about three or four weeks later we got back together but I didn't end the situationship I had with this other girl until another few weeks after that because I didn't want to hurt her and had no guts enough to face what I was going through. Eventually I talked with this other girl and told her that I loved someone else and that I couldn't be with her because of this, she understood and we remained as friends afterwards.\n\nAfter that I felt relieved but by then my gf was feeling very insecure and suspected of me on everything (even though she'd never tell me this) until one night I slept at hers she grabbed my phone searched for the conversation I had with this girl and she found out even though I had already ended up that situation. She woke me up in the middle of the night to interrogate me, I told her the truth and tried to explain her what happened. She obviously believed nothing of what I said. She tried to break up with me but a week later she was at my house telling me she wanted to stay with me and what not, but under some restrictions, and I agreed.\n\nI know I fucked up before but I loved her and I wanted to be with her and make things better. Of course this didn't happen. The whole year after was living hell. She would always be mad at me, spy, gaslight and control me over my other relationships. Any time she was pissed off she would bring up that I was a cheater lying piece of shit even months after. I always tried to descalate the situation and make it better and told her that she was free to go if she wanted but at the end she would always tell me that she wanted to stay and be with me.\n\nThings got worse and worse with time and at the slightest sign of conflict or discomfort she'd always try to end the relationship. I got so depressed for living under these circumstances for months that I broke up with her again when I couldn't stand it anymore. I told her that I couldn't keep up with our relationship and made her see all the problems we had and the mental state she had and all the hate she had for me. I tried to tell her that maybe in the future when we were at ease with ourselves maybe we could try and be together again. After the second breakup she would text me everyday a hugging emoji and tried to speak with me but I tried to stay as far as I could but it was just so hard. I felt so guilty and so fucking depressed every single day. I missed her so much.\n\nOne day she texted me and told me she wanted to talk with me and I agreed. We hanged out and I couldn't help but to tell her that I had missed her so much. She told me how better she was feeling with herself and how much realization and self-aware she got the couple of months we were apart and that she knew she wanted to be with me. Again, we got back together like a week later just to fall back again in the same shit hole of her being mad at me of what happened before and vomiting on my face how liar I had been and deliberately saying things she knew that hurt me. She'd again search through my phone sometimes trying to find out if I was cheating on her. I never did.\n\nThings were this way for almost three months and I tried to make her see that she was not okay with me, that she was actually worse than before and requested her to please end the relationship and to recognize that we couldn't be together. Of course during this argument she'd bring up again the past problems and call me names. When she saw that I wasn't joking about breaking up her mood changed and she told me that she wanted to be with me but I told her nothing. The next day she told me that she acknowledged that she had been screwing up the relationship and focusing only on the bad things. Honestly it was such a sudden change of mind that I really didn't believe her at all but I couldn't keep away from her.\n\nThe last few days it feels like she has been trying to lovebomb me although she'd keep this distant attitude. It's kinda hard to explain. Allover our relationship I have felt manipulated an controlled so it is really hard for me to believe this time it's different and that she has genuine intentions and I'm growing colder everyday.\n\nDoes any of these make sense at all? I feel so confused and I don't trust myself anymore to take a step out of this relationship. I feel so fucked up man I know I messed up but I have never tried to hurt her, conversely I have always tried to make things better but I just feel so insufficient. I don't know what to do or think about this anymore. \n\nPlease someone tell me something I feel I can't be rational anymore.",

        "Title": "Was I the victim of Narcissistic Abuse?",
        "Upvotes": 1,
        "Text": "As the title asks, I want to know if I'm misunderstanding what I went through or if I truly was the victim of Narcissistic Abuse.\n\nRecently my now ex girlfriend and I split after a tumultuous 4 months together. In the beginning month and a half things went incredibly and went fast. On the first date she had opened up about how she was sober and bettering herself and how she had gone through therapy and been healed from her past wounds from abusive relationships with previous lovers and parents, I unfortunately opened up about my past relationships and family troubles that I worked through. But the vulnerability was what struck me and made me feel safe with her, but within weeks I was love bombed and sex bombed and I thought everything was amazing we spent almost all our free time together, it took me away from my friends and family a lot of the time, not that we didn't do things with them on occasion but it wasn't extremely frequent. One thing she told me as well is that she considers cheating is someone that even flirts with other women and likes other women's profiles online. But I noticed she was doing the same just with men while we were together. She also had multiple online profiles showing a wide array of visible skin to the delight of many men online, which she would refer to as 'creepy' to her. And she would thank me for keeping the creeps away. Also throughout the whole relationship would always pick at other peoples relationships, her parents, and would always talk about her exes, and I mean this was constant.\n\nWe went on many expensive vacations together, all of which I stupidly paid for (still am to a degree) and there was never any attempt to help or offer to pay. She also was typically reluctant or slow to pull out her wallet to pay for things, which I now see as not her offering but waiting to see if I would pay. But around the two and a half month mark I noticed something change, she was no longer showing me attention like she once did. And sex decreased to a near standstill, barely once a week and by this point she was drinking alcohol frequently and telling me she was too tired to have sex and going to bed at odd earlier than normal hours. She also began nitpicking small things like my driving, or my cooking and what not.\n\nThe dating still remained until one day she had done something, made an assumption about me without my consultation and had an expectation I would do something for her and her friends and I was made to feel left out of what they were doing. I was annoyed and hurt by this and so I was quiet to her for the few hours of that night. When we returned from this event she asked what my problem was and I opened up and explained how I felt and how it wasn't okay with me, and then when I did that she broke down into tears and shut down entirely. The next day she wrote me a giant letter bout how everything I had done to her was not okay and that I was an awful person for doing the \"silent treatment\" to her and how I now reminded her of her exes and her father. I stupidly apologized to her and said I was wrong and swallowed my pride.\n\nShe suggested we pick a day in the week for us to talk to one another, and I said that it was a great idea and asked her what day worked best for her to do this, and she responded back with how she was too busy with her life to make time for it in her schedule, and suggested that we pick a day when we need it. Which blew me away like 'you suggested the idea and now you say you can't?' and it is also a trap because if I say we need to talk that will make me a bad guy who has an issue with her, the mutual talk would no longer be mutual.\n\nThen sex stopped entirely and she no longer would say \"I love you\" to me first, and instead of saying it out loud and would only whisper it in response to me when I said it to her. She would even isolate herself on the bed together and be annoyed at my attempts to cuddle. I also realized I was never the one she turned to for help it was always another guy friend of hers, she would also make decisions like movies and shows with them and not ask my input, she would ask them for their help with her daily tasks when I was right beside her in the room. I also noticed she would talk about her day in far greater detail with her friends than she would with me, and I would always get the short abridged version. Also she stopped having meaningful/vulnerable talks about our past for some reason.\n\nThen communication broke down around this point as well and it wasn't normal she used to be far better and more detailed about what we were doing. Then one day communication broke down so bad that she, what felt like intentionally, told me the bare minimum about what we were doing one night and when I tried to follow direction and obviously hit a wall and messaged her what was going on she exploded at me and sent me a text wall that basically said I should be able to read her mind (obviously not those words). And so I didn't respond and went with the night acting normal because the last time I was quiet she got extremely mad.\n\nShe ghosted me for 2 days after that, so now I was on the receiving end of the 'silent treatment'.\n\nThen she lied to me, she told me she wasn't going to some event the night previous and then sent me a message about how she changed her mind but the stories about why and how didn't align with what she told me the day previous. I told her \"Okay but tomorrow we talk\" and she agreed then ghosted all messages after. The day after she was sitting by herself with no emotion, I sat and explained my  grievances to which she deflected and gas lit me more than before about how again I had reminded her of her dad and her exes and I stopped her and said \"I am not them, do not call me them.\" She then took the opportunity to say that I wasn't emotionally mature enough for a relationship. I at that point gave her an ultimatum, we an try and work things out or we're done and without hesitation or emotion she said no. (I also want to point out at no time did I raise my voice or attack her, I just stated the facts as I saw them and read off my concerns) I packed my things that day and left. She messaged that day about paying me back for some petty item we I bought for us which was far less than any gift or trip we took. and the final message came days later saying thank you for our time together.\n\nI since blocked her from all socials as I was recommended to do and went no contact and have moved on, despite having some very dark moments, but now just a day after blocking her, she shows up at a location I frequent with my friends on the same day every week, she showed up with some new guy, and it was less than an hour till close and she has told me that she does not like the drinks there. I feel like she is trying to hurt me while also in a weird way stalk me, am I wrong, is this narcissistic abuse or am I over analyzing?\n\nEdit: If anyone has advice or help for me as well I would greatly appreciate it, this is my first time being involved with someone of this nature and it's like my head is trying to put together a puzzle that's been mixed with another set and is also missing pieces and I'm colourblind while doing it.",

        "Text": "All the kind words and advice is needed and appreciated. My ex and I were together for 4 years. He unfortunately broke up with me 10 months ago. I was completely blindsided by it. We were working on reconciling but he randomly decided he no longer wanted to and kept giving bs excuses. He then started to become emotionally abusive , verbally and manipulative towards me. He lied that he was single even though I knew she was in the picture immediately after he broke up with me. I had no idea where the hatred came from. I went to visit him and saw his now fiancé on the security camera. It made sense why the change of heart and even the anger towards me. I found out yesterday that he proposed to her back in December and they already have a wedding date which is June. Hurt is an understatement for years I would ask when he would propose , even my family asked and it was always excuses. I feel numb. She constantly brags about how I “ fumbled him” and even laughs at the pain he caused me. I know I should feel lucky I escaped considering he has a history of cheating. But it still hurts bc my time was wasted.",

        "Text": "\nAfter I found out my bf was cheating on me, he tried so hard to deflect and just minimize the situation although he was talking to someone else and denied we were dating. I have the recording of the day and he’s justifying it while also telling me it was wrong. He says “I was wrong” but never admits or elaborate on his wrongdoing. He love bombed me after that and a week later he’s asking for sex. He explains to me that if it was him he would’ve still been at least kissing but I’m like you really can’t base this off of your feelings, while he’s obviously not trying to see where I’m coming from. A few days later we have a huge fight where I was ready to forgive him or start over. All I wanted to do was communicate, talk about what happened and just talk about the relationship. He turned it around on me and basically told me that I can’t rush his apology. I blew the fuck up, I was rageful. In my rage, I threw something and broke the table basically giving him the perfect opportunity to flip everything on me to point me out as the crazy one. He took that opportunity. I had sent some very mean voice messages and just blew up and I wish I didn’t. Now his family thinks I’m the problem because I just blew up a lot in the relationship from just trying so hard to express myself but it always felt like a tug o war. I just wanted emotional intimacy. I’m now the abusive one to everyone and it sucks. I feel low. I’m leaving in march, so I’m here with him. I had posted something on my close friends instagram and one of his friends told him about it and he tried to break it off but I’m like I already have my tickets to leave. I was just gonna wait for the day and leave quietly, he seemed a bit shocked. Which is like dude why would I stay if you’ve expressed to me I’m the main problem in the relationship because I “overreact” to situations. He’s still acting like everything is calm and cool. Yesterday he told me although with everything going on we can still be friends because I just been grey rocking  him. I responded that well I was embarrassed and just been trying to keep my head low. The whole time he’s just smiling and keeps saying well you know we can be friends you don’t have to be all the way over there. It’s just baffling to me. If I was the abuser, why would you wanna still be friends with me? When I wouldn’t give him any attention, I can just feel his uneasiness. He would fidget, make random noises but my intuition told me he’s just looking for attention. He’s still calling me by our puppy names and I asked him could you please stop calling me that, he looked visibly upset that I told him that. I’m just drained and can’t wait to leave. Have anyone been in a similar situation where they had a partner who still acted nice even after painting you out to be an abuser/crazy. Or you can just comment on it. I’ve been really having a lot of cognitive dissonance about this situation like maybe i caused all this.",

        "Text": "I broke up with my ex 1 year ago after he ghosted and blocked me out of nowhere; in response i have blocked him on all socials + his phone number and went on with my life. A precise year later, i casually see him again on the public transit; this happened like twice but i tried to ignore it both times.  \nA few months forward, a girl who i knew was his \"ex\" (apparently just a \"friend\" whom he couldn't accept rejection from) texts me and says she has been told multiple times (by him) to contact me saying that \"he misses me\".\n\nI clear up that i don't want anything to do with him or his circle, but we end up chatting non the less. We mostly exchanged texts clearing up lies and \"shit-talking\" about him and his manipulative behavior, and she seemingly agrees with me and sent me screenshots of her messages from years ago saying she always disliked him. Now, i have asked her multiple times if they're friends or what not, because i don't understand why she would be friends with him and shit-talk about him with me at the same time; they're still following each other's socials, and by the screenshots she sent me, she replies to his texts in a cold, \"hateful\" way. \n\nWhat is going on? She claims they're not really \"friends\" but at the same time i don't understand their bond and, honestly, i can't trust it. I have a nagging feeling that she could have been sent by him to stalk my profile, since i have him blocked on all socials + my main active one is private. What if she's sending him screenshots of my stories and messages exchanged with her? I have now removed her from being able to view my stories.\n\nPlease let me know, and thanks in advance. ",

        "Text": "Hi all. \n\nWe've all seen the lists online of generic habits of narcs. Love bombing, gaslighting, hot/cold, etc. And obviously each case is different depending on the type of narc. What I'm curious about is some specific things I've seen that don't come up in those lists:\n\n● Liking their own social media posts. It's not major, but still weird. \n\n● It's their first relationship, and within two weeks they're ready to spend their life with you.\n\n● Your SO criticizes previous relationships and makes you feel embarrassed.\n\n● Convincing you to cut off contact with someone that they say affects *you* mentally.\n\n● Their parents are sure that their kid, your SO, has mental issues but they accuse *them* of the same thing. Oh, and the parents dislike you from the get-go.\n\n● Your SO has your phone for stretches of time, checking who you're talking to and blocking certain contacts, starting with their number and then proceeding through social media. All without saying anything.\n\n● They act fine around mutual friends and family, but they remain quiet and off to the side with people they don't know.\n\n● They do these things, saying it's because they care and know what's best for you.\n\n● They have a \"firm\" set of beliefs they absolutely won't compromise until they do, with a \"do as I say, not as I do\" attitude.\n\n● You want to share important news with friends, but they get angry when you say you want to share it with certain people - like one of the ones they blocked.\n\nSome of these feel obvious and fit under those umbrella lists. But at the same time, I feel like they're just asshole traits. I don't know if one is worse than the other (as far as narc vs asshole). And that's my question: would these be considered narc tactics? Or just signs of a terrible person? Or both?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "Text": "So my abusive ex hasn't seen our kids for almost a year of his own volition. He texted them a couple times and send money for them at Christmas, but was paying half the required child support and refusing to contact me. Recently my lawyer asked for some financial documents to try to FINALLY finalize the divorce and get child and spousal support calculations. The ex sent only one of the required documents and it looked a little suspicious, possibly forged, so lawyer asked for another one to verify, plus the financial statement from the previous year. My ex responded by demanding to know where I live. He also booked a mediation session and in it basically demanded to call with the kids 3x a week, but I was not allowed to be in the room, and then see them in 3 weeks in person. \n\nI'm really, really, really uncomfortable with all this. He stalked me when he moved out, has threatened my life, promised to abuse me for years and make sure I end up homeless, talked about how if I disappeared nobody would even know if I was gone, etc. I did go forward with the calls and one of my kids is SUPER happy and excited he's calling, but also started asking if I will stop loving them, obsessing over abandonment. The other is very conflicted but now wants nothing to do with him but has been acting verbally very aggressive and emotional. I overheard parts of the calls and he was asking them detailed questions about their plans, how long it takes to walk to school, etc, just fishing for information. And the second they paused or looked uncomfortable he would start gushing about how cute they are. His texts to me to arrange the calls are super agreeable and respectful of our schedules, etc.\n\nI also moved so he does NOT know where we live, has not been involved in parenting at all so doesn't know where their schools are. I am currently probably going to be legally obligated to give him this information if he keeps demanding it, but I was just finally beginning to feel a little bit safe again, and now all the fear and hypervigilance are back, along with so much doubt and guilt. I feel guilty keeping the kids from him, because THEY want to have a good relationship, but I know he cannot give them that. I feel too guilty to make that choice for them, and too scared to let him see them. I'm considering going to court for either a no contact order or exclusive custody temporarily while we sort things out, but that's likely to just drive him into extreme rage, and then if he DOES find out where I live, I'm in much worse danger. I honestly just do not know what to do here. \n\nI'm Canadian, if that's relevant for any legal suggestions. I mostly am just too easily manipulated and gaslit to know if I should safety plan with my kids and just let them see him and see if it goes better, or say I've given him enough chances and do everything legally possible to keep us all away from him. No option makes me feel safe. I'm frozen.",

The messed up part is that I thought this was normal growing up, it took me almost 30 years to realize how much abuse I actually went through…",

There were always red flags like anger, belittling, slutshaming and so many things that I didn't even think too much about because we werent together but it still affected me back then. I was a dancer for a while and I've changed my views on it now but it's something I never told people. I was doing it when we were casual and he found out leading to very intense arguments. I was shamed a lot and then had sex because I felt like I had to, often out of fear. Constant blaming, gaslighting, trying to convince me of things I know aren't true, shouting in my face, verbal abuse, circular arguments till I tired out, etc. Spoke to a few friends about this situation and they all told me to get out and that it wasn't acceptable. That he could've left instead of staying and treating me like that.\n\n I left a few times, went no contact and the last time recently was when I realized he showed so many signs of npd, just kept checking off lists. In any case it's been very toxic. Didn't feel like myself anymore and there was so much brain fog and paranoia. After clearing my head and being by myself for a while, I ended up coming back and got sucked back into it. I've tried breaking up several times but so far it's just been exhausting because he'd scream and blame me until I gave in. This time he reacted very differently but was still persistent. It's been a month of this change. Said I could leave if I still felt the same way in a day or two or whenever but that I had to give it a shot. I gave in eventually thinking I'd just wait and end things anyway.\n\nHe's been great lately but never took responsibility for the things he's done. He definitely believes he was justified in a lot of ways. I can't get over the things that have happened and there was definitely a strong trauma bond the first few times I tried to leave but I know that even if he does change I don't love him and I'm just stuck. I also feel guilty because he keeps trying to change and the other times were different but this time he hasn't been abusive and he seems like he's trying. I know people say they rarely ever change but I do believe he's trying to be more self aware and to be nicer and not hurtful to me. There haven't been any fights or issues lately. I still feel emotionally drained out and I really don't think I should stay but he keeps trying to reason. How do I get out of this?",

She is posting publicly that she's living in a victimization state and appears very informed about narcissistic tendencies and abuse patterns. She's posting YT channel recommendations for narc abuse and recovery.\n\nShe's offering empathy to 'anyone out there silently dealing with narcissistic abuse' She's presenting as aware of abuse patterns enough to utilize much of the language and systems of understanding that victims have to develop so as to present as a victim.\nI do think she has suffered narcissistic abuse at the hand of her mother, she takes the position of victim rather than a perpetrator of this abuse. I suppose both are true.\n\nI find it frustrating and amazing that someone can be so detached from the reality of their actions. I find it amazing that someone can be so aware of the nuance of their experience but be without any consciousness of how that informed their actions in turn. It's like her brain is off and the choices that she made to be truly abusive in our relationship just don't exist. Her supposed awareness of her experience as a victim and the lack of awareness of her own abusive behavior is enough for me to question the validity of my own experience having been abused at her hands.\n\nI think this is an extension of narcissistic projection. Is it common for narcissists to take the position of having been abused? Does this mirror your experience? What do you think?\n\nThanks,",

It was such a scary time at first because I didnt know what I was going to do and If I was strong enough to go through with it. Ever since April 1st, 2023,  I sent him my last long text message after him degrading me and telling him everything I felt, even though I know he didn't care. I needed to release it off of my chest and wipe my hands clean of him. After that, I never responded to a single, call, text or DM. I went on as if he never reached out to me. A few months later I started therapy with the absolute best therapist I could ask for. (Still with her till this day) She helps me so much on not invalidating my experience, helping me stop blaming myself and overall just encouraging me to love myself the way I was never loved before. She has helped me tremendously. My life has gotten 1000x better without him and im experiencing the things I never thought Id ever be able to do again and more. My life isn't perfect and God knows I have my bad days but Id take this over ever going back to him. Im going to treat myself on April 1st to one year of no contact... :) I hope this helps anyone who is experiencing the fear of leaving. It's ONE HUNDRED percent scary and you will have moments where you feel like you should just give in and go back but like so many people say time does heal. It gets better... love yourself the way you long for them to love you. ",

They appeared so happy and in love and it really hurt to see that, as if we had only broken up last week.\n\nWe were initially friends for a long time (part of the same friendship group), dated for a couple of years before he left, then on again off again for about 7 years with him always approaching me, want it to get back together,  pulling away or “changing his mind” again  and calling it off when I would share my true feelings before I finally said enough. Most of the emotional abuse and damage to me was during this on again off again time rather than during the relationship itself. Cycles and cycles of lovebombing, devaluing and discarding. We have been no contact for 6 or 7 years ago now and I have moved on in life and been in therapy to heal.\n\nHe seems to have a pattern: All of his girlfriends including his current are physically very similar to me, and this one is part of another one of his social/friendship circles like I was and at least one other girlfriend before me.\n\nI realised he knew her when we were together and during the on/off again period. I assume he must have always had his eye on her, like he did me before we were together (he told me he’d had feelings for me for years during the first lovebomb and that he had never stopped thinking about me during subsequent lovebombs).\n\nAt this wedding I kept my distance from him (I had a strong instinct to keep away from him) but I could feel his eyes on me a lot despite being very loved up with his new girl right in front of me. It was so painful and I assume it was deliberate. I have no idea if she knows who I am, but she was happily sharing many details of their life together with my friends.\n\nThey live together now and I assume they will get married. I know it shouldn’t but it breaks my heart as that was the future I was promised. Years ago, one mutual friend who is actually very good friends with the new girlfriend told me she didn’t understand how I could date him. \n\nMy question is: is he actually in love or is this just a continuation of his pattern of picking out the most attractive girl in his social circle that he will eventually discard? I can’t see him doing that as she brings a lot of ‘social value’ to him due to all their mutual friends.\n\nAnd more generally, do narcissists prefer to date friends or friends of friends within their social circles? If so, why?\n\nI’m confused because he told me one of the reasons we couldn’t be together was the social pressure for it to work out because of our mutual friends/social circle, yet he’s in exactly the same situation with his new girlfriend. \n\nIs this a classic narcissistic pattern or was I just not “the one” ?",

        "Text": "Narcissism and early dating\n\nIs this a narc?\n\nI(F) have been in two long-term relationships with male narcs. The second relationship became so difficult that I pursued therapy to figure out why I was blowing up the relationship. Probably the biggest blessing to come out of the relationship… also a curse. I feel like I’m stuck in a prison of seeing narcissism in every person I try to date because the fear is so extreme.\n\nAfter 3 years of being single, I’ve tried to start dating. I met “Z” mid-December 2023 on Bumble. Immediately appreciated his engagement and the fact that he did make me feel pressure to meet. We met early January for the first time and for a second time a week later. At that time, I realized I had also matched with his brother. I cut off things with the brother but Z asked if I’d be open to “talking exclusively.” At this point, I had started to slow communications with others but still planned to go on other dates. I agreed to “exclusively talk.” I know now that he deleted hinge entirely but only snoozed bumble.\n\nA few days after agreeing to exclusivity, we were texting consistently and he mentioned going to trivia. 5 o’clock hit and he was MIA. My mind immediately went back to my exes and I panicked and told him I couldn’t meet for our date the next day. He replied immediately concerned, apologetic, and suggesting that we still try to meet. We did. The night was fine but I noticed he tended to pace ahead of me at times. Something my ex used to do. \n\nLater, I lost service on my phone and texts sent from my iCloud. This allowed him to see my last name and he shared his. Hours later he asked if my opinions on religion would be a problem in the future. Which caught my attention because my cover photo on Facebook was a Bible verse. The thing is his profile picture on Facebook was still him and his ex-girlfriend of 10 years. The same ex-girlfriend, who stopped wanting physical intimacy with him, and supposedly had a hard time with a break up. He said they keep in contact because of a shared dog he wants to keep things cordial because he still wants to see the dog which he does from time to time, they’ve been split for a year. The picture didn’t bother me because it was on Facebook and I assumed he probably wasn’t using Facebook. I still found it weird but didn’t think it was a big deal until it was clear he had been on the site and left the picture. I asked him about the picture he changed immediately, but denied seeing my page. I asked him about the picture he changed immediately, but denied seeing my page. This turned into a massive conversation. He ultimately admitted to seeing my page but not because he signed into Facebook but because he googled my name the problem is that’s not possible because I don’t have any of my social media showing on search engines so he lied a second time to cover up the original lie. He admitted what he did why he did it and apologize for his behavior. I got things off immediately.\n\nIn true fashion, I also sat with what happened and weighed the pros and cons of him, and decided to revisit the relationship. I said that I would want to talk without exclusivity. I think it’s important for me to see other people and he was agreeable to this. We hung out once it seemed to be OK and then we went to a basketball game. On the way to the game he said that a couple of his friends were there that he wanted to say hello to, but that we wouldn’t be hanging out with them and asked if it was OK. I didn’t really like the idea of this but there’s also a chance that you run into somebody you know anywhere you go, so I said it was fine. It ended up being his female friend; who he didn’t introduce me to, I had to introduce myself to her, and her husband. they agreed to all meet up at halftime. He said nothing to me until halftime hit and I declined to go with him. This created a weird vibe at the game, but we moved past it. But then he asked me about it in the car ride home. And it just struck me as so strange to be able to realize that that was probably a strange thing to do on a date and then apologize for it.\n\nThe other thing that really sticks with me is him saying on the ride home that he’s just not used to someone that he’s attracted to being attracted to him. He seems constantly unsure of my opinion of him regardless of what I say. He makes the comment, just let me know when you’re done with me. He was heavy, most of his life and lost weight. I don’t feel that I’m particularly more attractive than him, but I can understand the insecurity.\n\nThere’s a part of me that realizes that I am incredibly paranoid because of what I’ve been through. But I feel like I’m being tested and I don’t want to let this go too far and have made a mistake.",

        "Text": "I (F) ended things with my ex early December after a 2-month holiday trip that went extremely wrong. His mask fell off completely and I went through hell. We were nearing the 4 year mark of being together - although a lot of it was long-distance.  We were gonna get married after that trip so he could officially move to my country - can you imagine!? \n\nIt was hard work but I managed to re-regulate my nervous system (mostly!). Although I feel a bit like an idiot for having been manipulated, I am overall thankful for the life lesson. Got away with many great teachings to apply moving forward like to trust my intuition, to beware of things/people that seem too good to be true, that empathy should have limits and so on and, strangely, with a better self-esteem as well. This whole shit show also allowed me to get closer to my family and to understand that - surprise - my father is also a narc (who dumped my mother like an old sock when she got older of course. Cheated with and married a woman my age, but that's another story!). \n\nI had forgiven him right away, even when he was still there lying to my face - in the sense that he never asked to have a personality disorder and live a miserable angry life. I feel mostly sad for him while also knowing there is no saving him. I focus on my life, getting back to being my true self who doesn't walk on eggshells and being happy I have wonderful close friends, I can keep jobs, and other things he will never have due to his mental disorder. \n\nBut now, for the past few weeks, whenever I think about it all, I just imagine what I would say if he eventually tried to reach out to tell me he's changed. I know the best course of action would be to ignore him, and that is what I officially plan to do if I ever have to. But my brain goes on a loop of wanting him to know how much of an asshole he is. I don't find these thoughts very helpful... I think part of the problem is that when I left, I gracefully advised him to shove things up his ass (!) , but then I felt bad so I called him a few days later to meet so I could apologize and wish him good luck and all that. Maybe if I left it at being pissed and as mean as I get, I would be satisfied he knows how hurtful he was (we're talking silent threats by slowly putting his hand to my throat, cheating multiple times, pretending to be sick while I was the one who had lost 15 pounds in two weeks from diarrhea, telling people I was always this skinny, telling the doctor I was on hardcore drugs and so on...), but I also know he is well aware he was abusive (right? does he?) and he doesn't care at all. \n\nAny advice to get me over those annoying thoughts please?? Thank you! \n\n&#x200B;",

A confrontation was planned, where they (my ex and her flying monkeys) was expecting me to start trouble at an event we were all going to. I had no intention of starting any trouble. I am not like that. Also, since her best friend warned me about all this I didn't react to her friends acting weird towards me, and I believe it made my ex narc look silly to everyone (I know several people in the friend group was told I was going nuts or something).\n\nThis best friend is really close with my ex, and I really dont understand why she warned me. I know she must have known about my ex's activities during our relationship, and probably helped her do it, as Im sure the favour is returned by my ex to her as well.\n\nAt this point I actually want to warn my ex about this, as it feels like this best friend is actually pushing or at least supporting her to act in the way she does (lying, cheating, manipulating), instead of seeking help to get past that behaviour. My ex seemed to me to want help with this, at least she indicated that on several times, but I doubt its possible when her best friend pushes and supports her the other direction.\n\nIm staying away from all of these people, except when there is events I have to go to where they will be.Im beginning to think the best friend wants dirt on my ex, and is planning to \"cozy up\" to me going forward. She has tried to do that before.I actually dont want my ex to be hurt any more, especially not by a person she seems to trust 100%. I doubt I can do anything directly with it, though.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar to this? Is there any reasonable way of warning my ex, without revealing I know what has happened?Should I just ignore it?",

THATS what finally allowed me to get away. thinking about just my own healing rather than healing of the world caused me to act on what made me feel good short term, which was engaging in the game. i want what’s best for everyone, and behaviors that i was engaging in made the world a darker place. \n\nso, i suggest:\n\n1. doing shadow work—why do i attract these people? why do i like it/is this my habitual version of love? how does my trauma play into this?\n\n2. reconnect w your morals—who do i want to be in the world? what kind of person is this person making me? how can i take accountability for my behaviors?\n\n3. educate— what is a trauma bond? why is it so hard to leave? what kind of narcissist were they and what tactics of manipulation did they employ and not employ? why are they like this? how can i make sure i don’t pick up on their ick?\n\n4. process— talk to your friends but not too much: talk to a THERAPIST or SUPPORT GROUP to flesh out your feelings and experiences and make sense of it as many times as you need to. cry about it. cry again. be angry. but do not engage. \n\n5. no contact— block on everything. the thing that will hurt them the most and protect you the most is for them to have absolutely no access to you. giving them access, even to make them jealous or remind them how awesome you are, feeds their ego and makes them think they have a chance. DO NTO REACT. this will help you regain your sense of power and control as well. you will not feel as much of a slave to the addiction. \n\n6. rebuild self worth and set goals— write down things you live about who you are deep in your core. write down goals for the next month to have a healthier life. focus on rebuilding YOUR LIFE and YOUR SELF OF SELF rather than shifting all focus onto them, their experience, what they did etc. journal. do hobbies. self care. work out. rebuild relationships with friends. learn about spirituality (if you’re into that. great tool for me even if it’s just a placebo affect hahaha). be creative. foster your LIGHT and love. volunteer and focus on something outside of yourself as well as your own goals and interests and who you are/want to be. \n\nthese steps are not in order but, in my experience, were necessary to get to the place i am today, which, not to pay myself on the back, is pretty damn good and i’m really proud of myself. took a LOT of time and effort but i can confidently say i am a better and wiser person because of it. i am oddly grateful for him now, despite the pain.",

        "Text": "My (28F) nex (31M) broke up with me at midnight on a Sunday, one month before Christmas. We had lived together since April 2023, and, to me, it came pretty much out of nowhere. I was utterly devastated, the way he did it was unbelievably cruel, but thankfully my family were able to support me, helped me to get out and disentangle from him very quickly.\n\nHe never overtly admitted to cheating (I did get him to admit to getting multiple STI tests done during our monogamous relationship, though), which considering he told me countless sob stories about how his ex had cheated on him (which I have since learned didn't actually happen), isn't surprising. But I had suspicions, so I decided to just message one of the women I had always been insecure about and she told me everything. Turns out he'd been maintaining a \"deeply\" romantic relationship (from her perspective) with her the entire time he and I were together. She did know about me, but he had told her we were in a casual and open relationship, basically that I was just a friends with benefits situation (she's poly and was fine with that), and had pretty much just ghosted her when he moved in with me. He never actually broke up with her just ignored her and breadcrumbed her till she got sick of being treated like crap.\n\nAfter finding out that my worst fears about his \"friendship\" with her were true all along (on Christmas day, no less), I decided to believe myself for all of the other situations in which I had suspicions, without needing to \"prove\" it with any actual evidence. My evidence for the other cheating is how I felt, the small things I picked up on, and the reality that he never cared about me and enjoyed the way he was able to destroy me. I travel for work quite frequently, and I've come to the realisation that every time I was away for work, he either did cheat on me or planned/attempted to.\n\nI've been no contact with him since the 28th of December, and it has been tearing me apart. It's like, even with all the evidence and proof of what he was doing, my subconscious is in denial. It is so, so hard for me to really accept and believe that he wasn't the person he pretended to be.\n\nI get intrusive thoughts about the kind, loving things he was saying to me while I was away for work, and what he was actually doing when sending me those messages, and I feel physically sick, like I could vomit. Any time I think about how real it was for me, how genuinely I loved and cared about him, and how it was literally never the same for him, I feel like I don't know how to breathe.\n\nI hate feeling like this. I know somewhere deep down that I won't feel like this forever, but I'm struggling to believe that right now. I'm struggling to see a future in which I don't feel like a part of my humanity, my very soul, was taken from me.\n\nPlease share any words of advice or your own experiences of healing/moving on and finding joy again, I know I'm not alone in what I'm going through, but it's hard to really believe that it will get better sometimes.",

I want to start with my previous post for anyone curious:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/s/yc0K1Powyr\n\nTL,DR version: my best friend's girlfriend was manipulated into leaving him a few months ago by what we think to be a religious covert narc. The response from this community seems to confirm that. Well, the situation has taken a dramatic twist. \n\nSo, my buddy tried to text her the other day because it was one year since they met. No response. Then yesterday, she texted him and said she was pregnant. He tried to reach out but got no response. She called this morning. Here's what I know:\n\nFirst, her new boyfriend had her phone and blocked my friend's number without her realizing, sometime in the past month. So she wasn't getting his messages. He didn't want her telling him at all. My buddy got through on Snapchat. \n\nApparently there was an accident with their protection and now she's 4 or 6 weeks along. She's nervous, obviously, since neither of them are ready for kids (she's 22, he's 23). Neither of them have told their parents yet since they're supposed to be a true \"Christian\" couple (whichmeans abortion is not an option). He even made a video sermon against premarital sex. She joked about being good at seducing men. She thinks her parents will be OK with it since they like him and he gave her a promise ring for her birthday. His parents don't like her and will probably disown him. He'll probably propose in spring. He even mentioned having lots more kids.\n\nMy friend is emotionally distraught because if this guy is a narc like we think, this was the last thing he wanted to happen. But he's trying to be supportive of her. He's worried that this might be the beginning of the discard phase or possibly another way to control her, doing the right thing for now and bailing later. Then again, is it possible he's not really a narc? They've only been together 3 months and her best friend says it's the happiest she's ever been. Any thoughts on if this is possible narc abuse?\n\nTL, DR: My friend's ex-girlfriend has been knocked up by a suspected narc, but he seems willing to do the right thing...for now. Is this the beginning of a new narc phase? Or were we wrong about him?",

But sooo many times they would start communicating again and be like “it was just a break”, “u knew i was coming back”. something along those lines. but when we would “take a break” it was so easy for her to go and do stuff with friends. sometimes if i was confident we would talk the next day i would try and take my mind off the sadness by hanging with friends. but most of the time i was too sad. does anyone know why they are so capable of not being affected by our relationship?",

        "Text": "I separated from my husband almost 4 months ago. It was not long before the separation that I started learning about NPD & strongly believe he has it. I am still trying to learn more about it as well as the abuse I suffered. \n\nI’m interested to know about other narcissistic abuse survivors experience with their memory. I used to pride myself on having a really good memory but now I absolutely struggle. I feel like I can barely remember my childhood. On many occasions, I’ve had my siblings & friends bring up an old memory & I would have absolutely no recollection of it happening. Sometimes the memory sounds familiar, sometimes I can picture it happening, but fail to find a solid memory of the event. It makes me so sad because I’m an extremely nostalgic person & had a great childhood. Not only that, but I feel so bad & so guilty for not remembering. Yesterday I was having a conversation about anime, and was asked what my fave anime’s were. I would mention them, but then when asked questions about them I couldn’t even answer because I couldn’t remember. These were shows that I LOVED, but I couldn’t even remember main/side characters, important scenes, my reaction to the most important episodes etc. I felt like a fraud.  \n\nI have the same struggle with short term memory. My brain feels so scrambled, I’m trying so hard to remember things all the time that it’s making me forget things at the same time. I have conversations with people & then completely forget the conversation we had when I speak to them only days-weeks later. I can’t complete a single task without my concentration breaking/forgetting something. I feel so overwhelmed by things I should have no issue doing. I would usually describe myself as a great multitasker in resumés, but that wouldn’t be as true now. \n\nI’m just curious to know if anyone else has the same struggles or if I should be seeing a doctor in case it’s something else. When I was being abused, I used to find it so ..weird how I could just instantly forget things and move on like it never happened. I was SO good at it too that it worried me sometimes. I suffered a great deal of physical, verbal, emotional, psychological abuse over our 8yr relationship, but after one of his episodes or fits of rage, I would just act like it never happened - smiling, laughing, just being my “normal” self - so that I wouldn’t trigger something else. I guess when things were “OK” I was just trying to enjoy it & make it last as long as I could before the next one. I’m rambling now 🥴 anyone else have the same experience?",

        "Text": "My narcissist never could just let me (or anyone for that matter even their mom), have my flowers. \n\nThey ALWAYS had to throw in something to downplay and minimize what I could achieve, if they didn't have their name on it or if they couldn't do it themselves.\n\nI remember for example winning a chess tournament. He wasn't good enough to play in that bracket, but said he'd support me. Lo and behold I took home first place with the final game being really clutch. Their response: *\"I mean congrats and all, but you were losing in that last game. The only reason you won is because he made a mistake in the midgame. It's not that big of a win to be honest.\"* So in other words, he made a tactical error and I did what you're supposed to do and beat him!? \n\nThen there's the time I had my college graduation. Leading up to my graduation, he'd always talk about how he could run and start his business better than  a business major. At first, I was really supportive of him and his business. He flunked out of college but seeing someone succeed despite a set back is an amazing story. Lo and behold at my graduation party, this dude had the most conceited speech I had ever been given. In short, he said. ***\"Congrats on graduating college. You have a long way to go though before your career starts so you should pay attention to the people who made it, especially the ones who didn't go to college. They know things you would never learn from the text book. A piece of paper doesn't mean success.\"*** People were looking at this guy in annoyance like wtf!? Yes, I am well aware of all of that. My question is why is that what you are focused on right now? You really have to rain on my celebrating one of my biggest achievements to make a better life for myself!? \n\nAnd then comes the time where I won my first amateur kickboxing match. I dominated the first and second round, scoring a knockdown in the second. The third round was close and could have honestly been scored either way on the judges scorecards. After the referee held my hand up to declare me the winner and I got my medal, the putdowns begin. This dude says, ***\"I mean props for winning but you only won because you were more athletic and did things he clearly didn't know how to do. It's not like it was an equal match.\"*** That is the stupidest argument I have ever heard as to why ANYONE doesn't deserve to be called a winner in a literal sport. I don't care if you are playing ping pong, doing the 200m dash, or powerlifting. The idea is to see in that moment of time, who is athletically superior, who trained harder and smarter, and in my case, who had the better gameplan coming in with a great corner. That's the literal idea of sport. This guy couldn't even do one single hour of training because his ego got hurt seeing how out of shape he was. NOBODY WAS JUDGING HIM FOR IT.\n\nAs the years went by I began to pick up on these things before what I described happened. They were always small putdowns that were hard to notice or masked as constructive criticism. Big surprise, whether it was me or his mom who got her real estate license (I could name a lot of other people he had to put down to make himself feel better), he never could do what we could do. And we never even faulted him for it. He was our family but I guess that was never enough for a narcissistic jerk. ",

I thought this was strange but felt he took his job seriously. I started to overthink and felt the need to constantly mitigate conversation with him because he presented himself as reserved and I more so outgoing one looking back as this being the supply. \n\nWhen he came back he was slightly colder and during a lunch date he told me something that completely cut me down in the relationship. This was around 3 months in when I started to ask about our relationship and where it was heading and he told me we only been dating a short time and that I was pretty much crazy or delusional about where the relationship was going, when I fell the love bombing earlier in the relationship. The total switch was 180 I felt and remember feeling a pain my chest because my feelings were so hurt and this was in public so I was mortified someone overheard. He took me out to a nice dinner the next week. I felt like I was dealing with Jekyll and Hyde.\n\nThe last discard was after a weekend getaway. I had s great time and felt we were bonding and when we got back he ghosted me for two weeks then sent me a random email of off guard photos of me( I didn’t ask for). The emotional disturbance I had during the discard were hard to overcome but I thank this subreddit and YouTube for helping me solve the silent treatment they give. I wanted to share for the people out there who had the sleepless nights trying to figure out what you did or said, walking on eggshells, not feeling worthy or feeling like your being criticized. These feelings are not if a romantic partner. I ealized when he ignored me that I have power too the power to walk away and leave them to play games with themselves",

In turn, the changes in the brain can increase the risk for chronic stress, PTSD, and symptoms of self-sabotage. Individuals who are in recovery after a relationship with a narcissistic partner describe feelings of confusion, procrastination, low self-esteem, fear of failure, and worthlessness.”\n\n\nIt started a year ago of going down the true crime rabbit hole which led me down the rabbit hole of npd. I’m finally realizing I was in a relationship with a narcissist. \n\n\nOver a decade later and I have all these “symptoms”. Is that possible ? Or is it something else or some mental illness that’s causing these symptoms?\n\nI never spoke to anyone in depth about what I experienced. I still occasionally have nightmares of not being able to escape, get away or im stuck in that relationship again and am searching for my now partner but cant find them. \n\nAlso,\nMy now partner doesn’t really know anything of what I experienced in that relationship. He only knew that “nex” would randomly show up at my (moms) house. I moved out and into my (now)bfs and so my nex started to show up at my job. That’s the extent of what he knows. \n\nI also don’t know how to explain this to him. It’s caused problems whenever there’s a disagreement. I don’t want to make it sound like I’m making excuses to him for my negative reaction to things, but sometimes I can’t tell if I’m reacting to a situation reasonably or overreacting. Sometimes I can’t tell if it’s in my head or if my emotions or reactions or “normal”. \n\nI also don’t want to make excuses and I want to take accountability of the way I am but I don’t even know where to begin. Am I right to blame the way I am because of this even after all this time? Or is it my fault I’m like this? I just want to be/get better. \n\nIt’s been a long time so I’m not “mourning” the relationship. I have no sadness over the relationship only rage. Angry I let it go on angry towards this person for what they put me through. I don’t want to be like this, I want to be better and I don’t know how to heal. I feel like I’ve wasted so much of my youth not just in the 5 years of that relationship but feeling like I never healed (properly?) afterwards(a decade later).",

Psychological abuse can be just as bad as physical abuse and the fact that many don't see that is something that is preventing me and probably many from healing and moving on.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I would say that is mainly because of me due to the support I give her emotionally, and physically. I am the one to pick her up and drop her off most of the time. I support with homework and meals. Etc.\n\nThis thought has come to my mind many times before . But I think my partner might be narcissistic , but if not that definitely toxic and abusive. \n\nHe yells, make me feel like shit. Embarrasses me in front of other family members - due to them living in the same home as us. So he tells and everyone can hear the things that come from his mouth. He’s been physically aggressive. \n\n2 examples I would like to bring up that have happened recently that are reinforcing my thinking. \n\n1. Came home from work and his son had left our living room a bit messy. I set the expectation that on Fridays before he leaves for school to clean the area because he goes off to his mom’s house for a few days. It’s not polite to leave a space that way. When I came in the room I was clearly upset but opted not to mention it bc I didn’t want an argument. He asks me what is wrong so I shared my frustration. I shared my solution to the problem which is “if you get home before me please enforce this rule and having him come back to clean his mess” somehow this turns into a whole argument where close to the end he says that he felt the same way I felt. So if you felt the same initially why did you create an argument when we could have been focused on solutions? \n\n2. I was out for a few hours early in the day and came home. We had a talk about investing some money in one of my friend starting her business. He no longer wanted to invest in her, and have me do something else. I was disappointed so I left the room to go get some space and eat. I began playing video games with my daughter and lost track of time. He came out of the room and said something about me being gone all day. And how we both continue to do things the other doesn’t like so we should just break up. This is something he throws out often so I shut down . He knows I don’t like discussing that. And I’ve noticed and shared with him that any inconvenience he goes down that path. Anyways it turns into an argument where we are discussing me moving out and he’s telling me how I won’t do . And just going back and forth with me. To finally walk away angrily, then come back later with no apology but just back to acting somewhat normal. \n\nSorry this is a lot. I would greatly appreciate any support, and stories of your own if you’ve dealt with a person like this.",
