# Mental Health Text Classifier

A machine learning project designed to classify Reddit posts into various mental health categories (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.) using NLP and transformer-based models.

---

##  Project Overview

This project aims to help identify mental health conditions from user-generated Reddit posts. By using transformer models (DistilGPT), the system classifies text into predefined categories. A future version will provide personalized suggestions based on the detected mental health condition with a user friendly interface to deploy the model using Flask.
